alcoholism,EhndlessSl0th,2020/01/01,"Started the New Year with a bang. Hey, I'm new here, 22F. 
Last night started out simple enough. Having a few drinks with my on and off again boyfriend of two years, then his dad and sister wanted to go out to a bar, which I didn't really want to do, but I wanted them to spend time together. At this point I had had 3 Moscow mules...and had three double rum and cokes at the bar. 

Felt awkward...I'm sitting in the bar, and all of a sudden it hit me. Apparently I stopped talking and was just staring into space, weirding people out. To be honest, that's where it starts to get blurry. Then, I just have the sudden urge to leave. So without telling anyone that I'm leaving, I just dip out. The house is only a couple blocks from the bar, so I think I can do it . 

Cue the very blurry flashbacks of me falling onto the pavement multiple times, struggling to get up. At one point I lost my glasses, my ID, my debit card, my juul...
I stumble up to what looks like the house, I'm trying to get in but the door is locked and I'm just wrestling with the door.

So I sit down against the car in the driveway. My boyfriend calls me, asks where I am. Me, still being very drunk, says I'm at his house. He's freaking out, because I'm not there. About an hour later I stand up and realize I'm on the wrong side of the street. 

My legs are bleeding, I hit my head a couple times. I've been crying. 
He starts freaking out at me..he tries to talk to me, but I just stare at him...Im just shocked. I call a friend to come get me. He wrestles my phone out of my hand. I start crying again, not talking at all, and he screams at me to get out of his house. He and his sister pack my stuff and I stand on the sidewalk to wait for my ride. My friend shows up, picks me up and takes me to her place. My knee is really bad. Looks like it needs stitches. 

I wake up to find he's blocked me on everything. Says what happened was unforgivable, I ruined not just his night, but his family's night,  and tells me to stay out of his life. 

It's been 12 hours since I've woken up. My body is still so, so sore. I singlehandedly ruined my relationship in two hours, lost my best friend, and I've almost cried like five times today. 

I can't do this anymore. I've always drank socially, went kind of heavy last year, I got a DWI...I'm just so tired of waking up like this, over and over again.",1.5417838910947241,3.148867670731712,2.8068784269238063,95.3178530913216,78.59349593495935,5.552353942144073,20.38494989601059,6.146975581142439,-0.12151442616751673,1802,44,420,12,43,581,228,492,0.153,0.769,0.077,-0.9879,1,0,1,0,1,0,86.0,0,0,1,3,24,22,0,1,25,0,23,19,7,1,2,60,62,26,0,4,16,3,2,4,3,0,4,3,3,0,14,28,8,4,4,8,2,6,6,12,0,5,15,9,60,10,74,43,6,92,0,4,4,0,35,47,0,1,38,253,74,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07455196687799387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0619492333741979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383543079157252,0.052057901556628115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06960167668150119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062163512537363776,0.04538466584511695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07813177819229991,0.0,0.0,0.08269832692177152,0.0,0.0,0.1520456816148372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06413298269921637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16475732985106714,0.2453429300920998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0729336800384139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692783123724348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06691179838304273,0.0,0.07018581900947005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07148467843524979,0.0,0.06804690609979981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.172562077451631,0.0,0.1944879901207496,0.0,0.0423122444518849,0.0,0.05954530171255905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06583681298701026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0764082510322326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21995784614992053,0.3436260385746869,0.0,0.0,0.08041990418479457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07752930626336797,0.0,0.12137507662662415,0.0,0.15766581299913282,0.0,0.0,0.05258697468025536,0.1454920791736706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12504025321705514,0.0,0.16254422025208498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055204506310439536,0.0,0.14381056589131982,0.0,0.20960178611487715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05044995472536989,0.05662337441886494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051614980163342816,0.0,0.07778549565828903,0.0,0.14076060397108328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09539049137937684,0.0,0.0,0.07993255952723394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11841291804995074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06158667356646037,0.0,0.0,0.07589346427333478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2634841633291026,0.07935490766827437,0.11891340100661213,0.062244407101426175,0.0,0.07783239701922695,0.08522863397320968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055977920099152784,0.1795227888245339,0.13014698933429958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047705223269253874,0.0,0.0,0.17365201163403707,0.08557052373982278,0.07057088508326186,0.0,0.0,0.10109474456979528,0.0,0.14545570510606656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285981811265953,0.13173946544668153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06901686436894458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176815033957251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08140052990458475,0.0,0.1438320955214125

alcoholism,SauceoffSauceOn,2020/01/01,"I am an Alcoholic. How do I quit? I have been drinking daily for the past 5 years. I need and WANT to quit but I cannot afford treatment. I have no medical insurance. Hell,I don't even have a doctor.  I would like to quit cold turkey but I know the withdrawals can be fatal. I have access to benzodiazepines,but I have quite the addictive personality. Should I taper or take my chance with the benzodiazepines? I plan on attending AA meetings.

alcoholism,Kratomom,2020/01/01,"No Alcohol New Year! Just want to say I’m proud of myself and anyone else who resisted the temptation to drink on such a popular drinking holiday. And if you couldn’t resist that temptation, keep fighting the good fight. A “boring” night staying home with my husband, enjoying our time together was so much better than getting wasted, not remembering the night, and waking up with regret and feeling horrible. It’s upsetting that today could have been an even higher number of days without drinking (I slipped 19 days ago). But those 19 days feel good. I don’t think my husband understands how big of a personal accomplish last night was for myself and that’s why I’m (now ranting lol) on here to you lovely people.

alcoholism,Rikimaru95,2020/01/01,"Resolution 2020 is the year I do my best to be clean. My battle with Alcohol has got the better of me too many times now. Every poor decision and humiliation has been under the influence of its impulsive chaos.

It all started when I was about 16, I loved the social crutch it aided with my anxiety issues. From there it led me to drugs and some really out of character decisions that changed my life for the worse. I’m now 24 and realise I must cut it out my life before it destroys the people around me and myself. Good luck to all those starting sobriety.

alcoholism,flyroasterVT,2020/01/01,"I think I’m ready Good morning everyone. A funny thing happened for me this morning. I’ve been thinking a lot about my relationship with alcohol for a few years now. Generally I’m in control of my drinking, and of myself when drinking. Then about once a year my anxiety has me wrapped so tight that I just completely unravel, completely losing it, and it’s almost always excessive alcohol fueled. I had one of those on Christmas Eve. It was awful. Since then I’ve returned to drinking responsibly.  Had some drinks last night for NYE but didn’t go overboard. 

Then this morning as my 3 year old daughter and I were the only ones awake, playing in the kitchen, I just took all of my beers from the fridge and one after the other cracked them open and dumped them out. I didn’t plan this, I didn’t even think about using New Years as a date to stop drinking. I don’t know if this is forever or what it is, but I just suddenly feel like I’m ready to not have it be a part of my life any more. And I thought that maybe joining this community could help me through this is I navigate this next chapter of my life.

alcoholism,djbrown92,2020/01/01,"The day I decided it was over Hey all! I am new to this community and so deciding to share my story, in the hope it can resonate with even one person who can relate! I am 27 years old, 2020 would have marked my 10th year of drinking. I have had a drinking problem since I was about 20 years old. Around this time I also developed generalised anxiety disorder and later social anxiety disorder (my drinking mainly contributed to this). For as long as I can recall I have always had underlying mental health issues, but these were completely manageable and didn't impact my life before I started drinking. It is almost impossible to take a step back and see the damage your drinking is causing you and those closest to you, because abusing alcohol completely robs you of your perception, any empathy for others and your sense of self, as well as money which you work too hard for to drink away to feel like crap anyway! I urge anyone suffering in a similar way to take that step back and use it as inspiration to make a positive change now! No matter your age no matter if you are in a better or worse situation than me! I have had 1 or 2 sober spells in the last 10 years of 6 weeks and 2 months sober, I felt so happy and free during these times, but always felt like I was missing something during it.. In hindsight I can say with absolute certainty that I wasn't! When I went back to drinking after these spells I hit it worse than ever. I did dumber shit and hated myself more and more. I've gotten into multiple fights when drunk (which is completely out of character for me), my fiancee left me months before we were due to be married because of my drinking, and I have lost many friends through actions and words used when I am under the influence. The day I decided it was over was just a few days ago at my friend's house, I completely blacked out and have no recollection, but suffered a head injury from a drunken fall. This caused a severe concussion and I have had to miss a week of a job I have just began and I'm now in danger of losing! I have decided once and for all I am never drinking again. I know for a fact that should I choose to drink ever again, it could be life or death, I will never be the guy who can just have 1 or 2 drinks I always feel I need to get shitfaced! I have subconsciously been waiting on a wake up call for years and now I have it. I urge any of you with a similar toxic relationship with alcohol to try and intervene before things get to this stage, or to seek help! If you are reading this it is absolutely not too late to change. Fuck what anybody thinks of your decision. Most of all do it for yourself, those closest to you will also benefit! My injury could have been much worse, brain damage could have occured (if it hasn't anyway and I don't yet know) I could ultimately be dead in the worst case scenario, and the thought of putting my family through that is enough to make me finally stop drinking for good. Had things panned out slightly differently I wouldn't be writing this post right now. In my eyes I am a very lucky man with one last chance to do the right thing, to stop robbing myself of happiness and a live a life independent of the binge drinking hell I've been living through during the last 10 years. Good luck to everyone and thank you for allowing me to share this story!!",6.650348915989159,6.256245179878054,6.9681910569105705,77.55987127371273,65.1890243902439,10.337669376693768,32.39905149051491,9.861636050157227,2.9181884823848234,2642,93,515,50,36,859,298,656,0.18899999999999997,0.6990000000000001,0.11199999999999999,-0.9959,2,0,16,0,1,1,54.0,1,14,0,4,30,36,7,0,29,0,67,27,6,9,8,104,99,46,2,13,15,0,5,2,3,5,6,1,0,4,38,34,16,3,17,15,2,6,11,17,1,2,25,9,70,20,87,59,11,85,1,8,3,1,34,26,4,13,52,372,108,4,0.0,0.0602964408074092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045110998566907125,0.10877206949324512,0.0509590789502504,0.0,0.0,0.08139358095798728,0.1270339069493449,0.0,0.0,0.06921401921043863,0.0,0.07786156656176249,0.0,0.0,0.035583537584595,0.0,0.0,0.04530297375821825,0.0,0.0,0.04781291932695771,0.11739402508372818,0.0,0.06204425897218616,0.0,0.12991116749746726,0.0,0.0,0.0450081533701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056810176236343525,0.05196447671283506,0.0,0.0,0.10455629150025583,0.10766994516686286,0.0,0.2134291849735865,0.0,0.0,0.16252639914612288,0.0,0.0,0.09845970346997628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05316931773137648,0.11664891525709685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6480879458056229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052583071777377616,0.0,0.03361242770368731,0.09206600864009486,0.0,0.04862766649244949,0.0,0.0,0.04797465233807677,0.0,0.05146312208195783,0.0363558939412517,0.09772494340965353,0.05574761143852909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863512211169284,0.04704707267240677,0.053175948313520835,0.0,0.0,0.08536839422035593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05038919484757143,0.0,0.10834690456661733,0.0455875291674402,0.050243432872204286,0.05222791912618778,0.05409379111541855,0.0,0.0,0.0341105578721381,0.0,0.0,0.050545346860198466,0.0,0.05872033684150221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05311603737933708,0.05050056668496484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05593573049580703,0.12444665858107415,0.05740624362639835,0.0,0.05529223697532005,0.0,0.1078355370102368,0.0497246595879931,0.0,0.08987377223450392,0.045036132539333217,0.0,0.056932998973955776,0.055552550117748026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06793906698346827,0.051594568678828834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051285246147804726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08123997640590534,0.0,0.037410075216551736,0.03773436051777291,0.07849915687240981,0.04914997073872747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10680118785490376,0.05419629016024928,0.06896889065566833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0444352679153328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04873864356098778,0.0,0.0,0.04869494793021048,0.0,0.05115860127977614,0.0,0.0,0.05090386644933143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05463691680073235,0.0,0.08691972591519627,0.0,0.040469846017021326,0.0,0.0,0.040552816846144216,0.0,0.053089467663489764,0.05749132191002203,0.052237951070582885,0.042096812357648776,0.05720259884181265,0.0,0.05187604297606355,0.0,0.03917768129364299,0.0,0.0,0.036020271076689064,0.0,0.0,0.0850927960327063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07652603597895302,0.0,0.0,0.04685276205358816,0.0,0.0,0.10142735325741807,0.032608317938756015,0.0,0.040401050845578636,0.05934884712841008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034551033901080525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08790540506123727,0.0,0.0419896579070973,0.0,0.04039418856642656,0.08164192891808755,0.0,0.04575630694006223,0.04717562778768113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03704859516122472,0.0,0.15558406299549268,0.036150863285310135,0.0,0.0,0.19662931558199154

alcoholism,silly_s3x_panda,2020/01/01,"New years...ugh Long story short, my girlfriend is very upset because she feels trapped that she can't go out. Basically, she feels like a 30 y/o in a 23 y/o body. Im sober, at least maintaining and she's been helping me through it for a few months now with some bouts of drug use (on my end). Either way, she gave me the zero tolerance ultimatum and I've straightened up. But she's a night owl and loves to go to the club and knows i cant be around it otherwise I will relapse. I've come to terms with that. I just don't know what to do to help her out.

TL;DR 
Girlfriend is feeling the pain of being young but living with a sober SO. Any advice on helping her through this as well?",1.3303023872679065,2.997861786206897,2.8386206896551727,94.57729442970823,79.41379310344827,5.840848806366048,22.188328912466847,6.67199483983844,0.2919230769230769,529,16,124,5,13,173,97,145,0.046,0.8390000000000001,0.11599999999999999,0.7617,0,1,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,1,8,0,10,4,1,1,0,22,21,8,0,0,4,0,3,1,2,1,2,0,0,0,6,11,0,0,5,1,0,3,3,2,1,1,2,3,15,3,22,16,5,21,0,0,0,1,15,9,0,1,9,76,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906463496423416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13267252434791235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1736775282676712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11892920759460955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21670858002504054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16805863106111746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22625036624877895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17279787027833274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2959404349866912,0.1393772036108946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2217560319331296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3923078478698943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21073803897051466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21444021459178586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09531444908323886,0.0,0.17227406197533246,0.17265454192723306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17608249261650136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15572441639266565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884257196423452,0.0,0.18308514464722167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20759676649735306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685010078354355,0.0,0.16097530455794418,0.0,0.15485877072964818,0.0,0.0,0.17541546686138432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,wicked_gypsy,2020/01/02,"Day 2 of sobriety! After what seems like forever, I've finally decided to stop drinking! I was never the daily drinking type, just a few times a month. Then almost 4 years ago I lost my dad and 8 months later my father in law. It started innocently enough,  a few extra drinks, then drinking every weekend, and next thing I knew I was drinking every single day. I've had it with feeling like crap all the time and blowing off friends to drink. Tired of the anxiety my drinking caused me. Just tired.

Just started not too many months ago and need to stop. Past 3 weeks, had 3 sober days. And I think I can if I get through the shakes and nausea and everything else as I detox.

alcoholism,nomnombubbles,2020/01/02,"Does anyone else feel like they are not taken seriously (maybe as seriously) with the nausea and up heaving constantly with their withdrawals? From family members to ER to ICU to detox it seems they just kind of want me to go through it because it is not as life-threatening as seeing ""shadow people"" or hearing stuff that isn't there which I do as well but when I ""stabilize"" I cannot eat even thought they want me to.  They ask my symptoms every so often and would only give me things like Ativan when the walls were crawling.  

If if upheave too much it makes my chest hurt and I see stars.  Or will choke on my vomit.  

Anyways I am out of ICU but still feel like shit and going to see if can get into proper detox tomorrow.  I am already in an IOP program but I had a relapse over Christmas so I am trying to get better.  And probably jeopardized my new job from not being able to tell them I was in the ICU during it.  

BTW does it also make anyone feel better when they are in fresh air while withdrawling?

alcoholism,KingPaimon9,2020/01/02,"Day 9. No rest. It's the 9. day since my last drink and I can't sleep. I feel like I am stuck in my weird dreams for aeons and when I wake up, only an hour or less has passed. Sometimes I am dreaming with my eyes open, see furniture move, shadows. Even heard a woman's voice in my bedroom. I live alone.
This has never happened before and I am afraid of the night, afraid to close my eyes and afraid to fall asleep.
When I talk to my doctor he would just say ""relax, detox is hard on body and psyche. it will get better."" It just doesn't change the fact, that it's scary and that I feel helpless at night.

Fortunately my days are better than my nights. Although I've got the common cold (the nights were getting worse before I got ill) I eat well, I get lots of fluids and I am kindling my passion for literature. 

Is there anyone who has experienced something similar during detox? Rationally I assume that it could be a sum of all things. Recent break-up, dark seasons, holiday stress, and detox.

Made a whole spectacle of myself &amp; I'm too ashamed to ask him anything about it. I don't remember anything but I'm still sick two days later and have to go back to work today. 

I'm just embarrassed as hell. Like HOW does this happen every single time? If I go out for one drink I might as well have ten. I am not capable of moderation.

alcoholism,mranonymous16,2020/01/02,"Anxiety Hey everyone.

I was a regular drinker until recently. Probably consuming on average 8 units a night. Over time I think this affected my mental health. I had my last drink on New Year’s Eve.

Yesterday I felt a massive sense of anxiety which lasted for a couple of hours or so. I honestly thought I was going to have a panic attack. So many negative emotions came out of no where and I think alcohol was to blame because over Xmas I drunk every day because I planned on stopping on New Year’s Eve. 

Anybody experience this? If so when does it stop. I feel like it’s coming on again. I have no desire to drink by the way, just annoyed at my state of being. 

Thanks.",1.7386363636363669,4.2673204393939415,3.843515151515152,83.18027272727275,83.24242424242425,7.762424242424243,26.981818181818184,8.648137234880735,2.529541818181819,526,24,100,14,15,179,89,132,0.225,0.688,0.087,-0.9344,0,0,4,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,7,6,2,1,6,0,7,5,0,1,0,16,16,8,0,2,3,0,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,5,4,4,2,5,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,7,2,14,3,19,8,0,34,0,0,0,0,1,10,0,2,20,64,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16088408569403553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23032910940013646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712637587395759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18353854852277168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1721804466248989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12967898229349484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16657234671810367,0.0,0.09708741986352612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317407039064472,0.0,0.0,0.2949485585804965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16933998276627812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12683849871053712,0.1438497529654535,0.0,0.14725939334486773,0.0,0.0,0.07611878105923589,0.107547549358539,0.14454435079898753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08555673801744218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16001957425051502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482539791314968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2454243627893498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07354743208924817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526264057922882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517113717615811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29078965366857645,0.0,0.1412738821029353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1766291173937218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16231021243712118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486424981219941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2517204417025673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13859925292126293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19292303408543576,0.0,0.11951388176489212,0.08778250751073834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11949358185679428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1938887915217808
alcoholism,ArcticFox-EBE-,2020/01/02,"My father is in the ICU. Cirrhosis of the liver with ruptured esophageal varices. How can I talk to him about it. This happened a few days ago. He's still in there. I don't want a pity party. I really just need to straighten my thoughts before I drive home and talk to him. I'd really like to know what to say or how to say it to get through to him.

My mother and brother are there with him. The doctors told him he was lucky to have survived and if he doesn't stop drinking he will die. soon. According to my mom and brother he is not very receptive to this.

I don't really know what to do. Obviously he needs to stop drinking and being a former addict myself (unknown to them) I understand how impossible that will seem to him. I just really want to sort my thoughts and find a way to get through to him when I drive down next week to talk to him.",1.7860227272727265,3.6257010113636414,3.2488636363636374,91.36204545454548,78.6590909090909,6.672727272727273,23.5,7.645422480735847,0.9536886363636364,662,22,147,10,16,217,93,176,0.05,0.865,0.085,0.7145,0,0,2,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,1,11,3,0,0,7,0,13,5,1,3,1,32,27,12,1,5,5,5,0,1,0,2,2,2,1,0,7,8,2,2,7,2,0,2,4,1,0,0,4,2,23,2,29,20,1,16,0,1,0,0,26,3,0,5,11,99,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1607716943943983,0.0,0.0,0.1307294589713676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12549206166129434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09511046214905207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15305783854937827,0.0,0.0,0.15094895485329551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28894262259951803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13479130285146435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541012873613408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041342078201298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14793145183293166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16209900062485874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07204981104366902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17272327565922907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21870464817144486,0.0,0.0,0.1568434586601255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779101607884978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345592535094479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13425751858720908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11777531975275972,0.2465947449870276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35560926990122793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341605234512247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14092058995700196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15352875420884304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12168396699191028,0.1739715068354975,0.11706037517755614,0.11829715076036935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,rcasoblanca,2020/01/02,"Should I go to med detox? Not a shit post I swear Hey guys I don’t spend a lot of time on this sub and idk what I’m looking for here because everyone’s just going to say I’m not a doctor, but what would you do? 


I am 30m, let myself go on a bender that has only lasted 14 days but all my symptoms of withdrawal are bad. I basically drank straight through the holidays and am waking up hurting and In need of support. I immediately got myself back up to like 16 a day? Idk even know I was just getting as much as made me glow so I was making multiple trips to the store, usually 6 drinks at a time, three times a day but for the life of me I couldn’t tell you how many I had yesterday, probably 16. I drink bourbon by choice, cheap beer if I can’t get it.


I called out of work so much this week I probably lost my job, I have two kids who live with me and my wife is furious, I have enough money where not working for a week shouldn’t ruin us but I need to end this. Any ideas on detoxing? I can get into med spot but I’ve been there and it’s three days of misery I’m avoiding because it’ll suck. I feel like I can do this at home because it was a short run, my wife is on the fence, she is well versed in alcohol detox but certainly no nurse and I’ve had some bad symptoms. Worst for me is the hammering heart, I have had some moments in the middle of the night before the packie opens where I’ve prob had some dt symptoms of being delusional and scared but idk, has anyone picked themselves up from bender like this without med detox? Best choice is obviously to make sure I don’t die but hard taper sounds just as bad. I can probably get gabapentin but no benzos to be had. All the other symptoms are there, sweats, shakes but not too critical and some fear/delusional moments where I’m scared of my own shadow and light and loud sounds are scary. Anybody else clean up at home from a bender this short? I’ve been to med detox a few times and I know it’s prob be easier, and everybody’s different but any long term drinkers that fell off and sweated it out after two week bender? I’m done and won’t get to 16 today but my chest is thumping if I don’t get a few in me to start the day and I look like dogs ass covered in unholy stank sweat. I’m sorry for the long post I just had about a year sober and feel like an idiot signing into medical if I can avoid it.",2.130654761904765,3.3987864702380968,3.5823333333333345,91.82100000000004,76.1626984126984,6.865396825396826,22.520634920634922,7.461004344511776,0.6375334920634925,1847,50,426,23,40,609,238,504,0.185,0.728,0.087,-0.996,3,2,5,0,0,0,35.0,1,2,0,4,18,27,4,5,25,0,48,25,8,5,5,76,80,37,1,9,24,2,3,5,0,5,13,4,3,2,19,22,5,3,5,4,4,7,14,17,1,4,16,12,45,10,56,54,16,65,0,3,3,1,13,29,3,8,32,265,64,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07948365821418375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10115433993639507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052004338109998965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057189353906836826,0.18629865365865608,0.1360139058842804,0.0,0.06328717095409321,0.0,0.07805138679721665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07594461934142739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2398268064874099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07718892705964801,0.07770546056043393,0.0,0.07612539139667904,0.0,0.076110874915737,0.0,0.14571727414706914,0.0,0.0,0.06213030154251059,0.0,0.06587367880550399,0.07684867860796796,0.0,0.049123616527582126,0.0,0.0,0.07106796517242323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369192292080681,0.07521190366707463,0.10626623034976893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331454529085412,0.0,0.12680612553745482,0.0,0.05948403432576613,0.0,0.0,0.07364238925694064,0.0,0.0,0.06662489008539038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881340701262506,0.0,0.0,0.1492072559443102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961937683543746,0.08395969046962219,0.0,0.0,0.07380515606094289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817484949105528,0.060625095655765376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07605290446377598,0.05253286685939725,0.18167797422269885,0.0,0.06567399359033367,0.13163807888264334,0.12491159672631275,0.0,0.08118848757878247,0.06323048968289219,0.0,0.07037489392761187,0.0992910331606751,0.07540400916672703,0.0,0.0,0.3304529476427553,0.07492442424533279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10934754284376147,0.11029541051479988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06979537417402182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0565651134632183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14246031006572166,0.0,0.240564678495767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05914554028039945,0.14892357939186954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634429441394995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325609704747802,0.05264261180981943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439923373571233,0.07009703001356445,0.30921408469863965,0.0,0.0,0.06500653920881681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17347333750428776,0.0,0.07049827324675481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14530604273658204,0.0,0.08946329447348095,0.0,0.08191293870126795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17897606998665067,0.0,0.06687155404711767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07169430661219511,0.0,0.10829095700135856,0.0,0.0,0.05283346864510502,0.0,0.0,0.04789470123908498
alcoholism,AgentQuackers,2020/01/02,"Day one and hopefully more I been drinking for a few years now. I kept telling myself it’s normal because I know other who drink more than I do. There was a time when everyday I would come home from work I do it everyday. It has caused a strain on my marriage that I don’t know if it can be repaired.

On New Year’s Eve I secretly bought alcohol to celebrate. When 2020 came I thought of everything I had done in the decade. I noticed that I have not invested or taken care of myself since high school. Everything I been wanting to do or learn has always been put off. This is the year I want to take time and make myself happier. I am scheduling therapy and reaching out for the first time about my alcohol problem. 
I have tried to quit before and went back. Hopefully this time therapy and you guys can help.

alcoholism,Ghuernica,2020/01/02,"Need help I've no idea where to start with this. I've kinda stopped using reddit, I don't think this is the place to completely change shit but I've alienated myself a bit and I'm also pretty ashamed to speak about this with anyone in my life. Without some community though I don't know if I can fix anything.

Recently I've been drinking a lot, like every single day a lot, I think some of that has been exacerbated by my current partner drinking very frequently. While I have trouble with that it doesn't seem to affect his work or life so let's just leave that one aside for now. 

The problem is me. Quite simply, and I don't know how much the liquor is to blame it's been a wild ride of a year, I've become a fucking piece of shit person. I'm volatile and angry and frankly I've behaved fucking horrifically the past few months. I've started blacking out and forgetting how bad it is too and then having to try and navigate how it affects the people around me without asking them exactly what has happened. It needs to stop and I'm not sure where to start. Part of the problem is that the fallout just means I detest myself overall - I am finding it very hard to see redemption as a possibility for myself. I am quite scared of where this is headed.

I'm not going to be able to abstain entirely and I'm not going to work toward that right now. I am going to try and slow down. 

But the reason I'm here is more to understand how to start figuring this out. Has anyone here experienced the same thing? How does this work? What can I start doing to stop behaving this way, short of cutting alcohol out of my life entirely? How do I reconcile how I've behaved with who I am? On that last point, how do I feel like I'm still a person after the damage I've done?

Any advice would be really appreciated.",3.717615423642824,4.9661305616438405,5.006057838660581,83.24959411466264,72.15068493150685,7.818366311516996,26.66920345002537,8.285830014693849,1.6770771182141044,1425,48,288,22,27,474,182,365,0.175,0.779,0.046,-0.9936,1,0,3,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,1,5,24,15,5,2,18,0,33,12,3,12,2,71,64,28,0,6,11,0,2,2,1,1,4,1,0,3,23,18,4,4,13,3,0,4,10,12,0,1,4,6,24,3,43,56,12,43,0,1,2,2,9,15,4,8,25,195,47,3,0.0920348546997692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993539484123475,0.0,0.0983572700874517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360024005212829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625868572054883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870582064607486,0.0,0.0757368435400717,0.08193053320509867,0.08604016535213965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684525937585826,0.0,0.10164526620459396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10047822451376633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09736067288612088,0.0,0.09649679411632132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059354867427789865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08054032155970918,0.09418361017690953,0.0,0.1803182391412997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07754333451529008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046535587874173605,0.06574971858694863,0.0,0.0,0.08411818984361309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17016948028009155,0.0,0.0,0.1569165866098131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08138611806123063,0.0,0.08244515232322487,0.0,0.09445431297818692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061689023093780326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10389614843502304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1011598984472142,0.07502069030873612,0.0,0.09745162234310367,0.0,0.09411187448269602,0.19502081900537765,0.08992716229245884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15648948453638867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10025293771024132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07346134295762441,0.0,0.06765620787043622,0.1364853571809388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06236519942532458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09966477890873232,0.0878576827718078,0.06380537997990138,0.16072257034800946,0.09615683454097183,0.0,0.08700268598527844,0.1037554701829642,0.0,0.0936325343571862,0.0,0.1761298527381073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19578079353479147,0.0,0.0,0.058959884607814414,0.09462715901476744,0.09087331584842087,0.0,0.0,0.07859726304370031,0.0,0.0,0.0921429451646848,0.0,0.07333986340290911,0.08378507513126672,0.0,0.0,0.18894491154582596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3257137192864705,0.0,0.07349915384950409,0.23083577873100286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674176136676663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061143867937622075,0.11794443737411454,0.09042377745604274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497125002922993,0.0,0.0,0.09581152952593908,0.0,0.07948856455555342,0.0,0.15187678759406334,0.0,0.07305298379081042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1774366313182573,0.0,0.20100741105378345,0.0,0.0,0.06537892016973354,0.0,0.0,0.05926742894541125
alcoholism,kaygwthrwaway,2020/01/02,"My boyfriend who lives across the country from me just admitted he’s an alcoholic. What should I do? Over the summer my long-term boyfriend moved across the country to attend university for the year. We’re committed to each other and for have a pretty amazing relationship. For awhile I’ve noticed he seems to have a complex relationship with alcohol. He seems to use it to help him cope with stressful situations as well as when his mental health gets him down. I’ve never brought this up to him because it was only suspicions. He is successful, productive and I rarely saw him using alcohol to cope, I would just find little clues or get snippets in conversations. Perhaps I should have addressed this head on and much earlier. I feel like I’ll always regret not doing that for him 

Anyways, that’s the backstory. He called me early this morning and broke down. He told me he’s not returning to school this upcoming semester as the financial stress is too much (he goes to a private institute and has to pay a very high tuition monthly) and that because of the financial stress he’s been under trying to come up with tuition and his chosen coping mechanisms he’s become an alcoholic. He cried when he told me and it absolutely broke my heart. He said he’s going to go to an AA meeting this weekend and told me one of our friends there will take him. He has a plan for work and is going to start that Monday instead of returning to school. He is super worried about having to tell his family and friends that he’s not finishing his program and he feels like a failure. I’m devastated for him. He’s the most wonderful person I know and I wish I was able to be physically there with him through this. I told him I love him and I’ll be by his side no matter what. He was seeing a therapist here before he moved but hasn’t since. I’m going to encourage him to find someone there in the next week as I think that’s an important piece of this for him. I guess I’m reaching out to see if there’s anything I should do, advice, resources, anything that will allow me to best support and help him through this. Thank you in advance ♥️

TLDR: my boyfriend has admitted he has a drinking problem and has said he is going to seek help. He’s across the country from me. What can I do to best support him? Is there anything I should be doing?",4.007639495390585,5.688238631004367,4.881710334788939,82.72281780688986,72.07860262008735,8.05832120329937,29.31610868510432,8.680891452615391,2.2990987869966037,1855,76,356,34,36,602,212,458,0.059000000000000004,0.785,0.157,0.9929,0,0,5,0,0,0,36.0,1,1,0,7,15,22,0,3,22,0,36,9,2,3,2,59,76,25,0,9,8,0,2,2,2,7,5,2,1,1,23,23,5,0,12,2,3,11,6,7,2,1,12,7,47,15,62,54,7,43,0,3,3,1,68,17,0,7,17,236,70,6,0.08038265880043974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07854900386585746,0.0,0.3436184653204935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06688481144250466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19844423743907333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09800104543976633,0.08877633130032239,0.06839972217660385,0.0,0.16871328239022748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207968195528259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06924254298954899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829657621341074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07874440362661615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0757776168436232,0.0,0.0812877750363191,0.11485077501649765,0.0,0.0,0.14693658777790675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420688558282653,0.0,0.08399324310267282,0.0,0.22841658707694446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855056108976878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08249579832687652,0.08544300744228181,0.0,0.09525383770593347,0.16163640540062352,0.08492869233687701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044176207088584364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07854181360993245,0.08056454140020987,0.07097936039936625,0.07113612354363202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254848791592892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0810068138677218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06416067135921298,0.17086809030952066,0.11818100633117068,0.0,0.06199606190062708,0.0,0.08548786955564935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09151618981697594,0.0,0.0,0.054469369922738806,0.06113463419906541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07018703716085789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08177806208752589,0.0,0.07691534855682496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17260178636278542,0.0,0.0,0.15292463192573208,0.0,0.0,0.16270308426276994,0.1281091437720645,0.14635470722077884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06649336601120001,0.09035347639307424,0.0,0.0,0.06810796595002536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05689525962622555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27623419221374673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18243457725827145,0.0,0.0,0.06043775567261251,0.0,0.07025798680068815,0.07400555247264104,0.0,0.09333046236019632,0.0,0.05150596204981599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30723630082794284,0.0,0.05457454886919719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13884961700758358,0.0,0.06632411186341051,0.0,0.0,0.06447812028247803,0.0,0.07227366383083311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924360906153279,0.0,0.08717156457442134,0.05851953295956591,0.08163249187895792,0.0,0.05710153452068259,0.0,0.0,0.05176379681849212

alcoholism,gordonthrowaway12,2020/01/02,"Quitting drinking? Quitting alcohol?

30 days of drinking? 

Been at it just about everyday since the week of thanksgiving.  I plan to go the first half of ‘20 completely sober. 

I want to get in the best shape of my life, have several critical moments as a professional, and want to save money! 

Worried however of withdrawals, I won’t experience anything crazy will I? What can be done to alleviate this? 

I had blood work done the week before thanksgiving, all came back completely normal. 

My level of consumption during this period has been 4-7 drinks a day. 

I started a taper after last night 6 drinks, today I had 4, tomorrow 2, Friday, Saturday, Sunday none... 

The discipline isn’t an issue and I could quit cold turkey, but am a little nervous of withdrawals. 

For full history, I was drinking daily 4-6 beers for approx 2 years. Basically all of 2019, I consumed 10-12 **TOTAL** on the weekends. Abstained during the weekdays. Then the week of thanksgiving, the holiday parties kicked off. I think since 11/22 I’ve had only 3-4 off days. 

7 is definitely on the high end above. Using conservative measures. I’d say 6 is near my max. But want to be as honest as possible here and there were some days I stayed around 4-5.

alcoholism,L3alls2urface,2020/01/02,"#Sober2020 I have been scrolling through this subreddit for awhile now. I left a comment on a previous post and wanted to share:

Everybody is different. I’ve found that I was able to quit cold turkey a few times by enduring work throughout a new week. Kept me distracted enough to not experience severe withdrawal symptoms. And by the end of the week, you’re on day 5. Unfortunately, that happens to be when my symptoms subside so I would fall victim to my own healthy-feeling and justify myself a drink. I’m going into day 4 currently after going on a binge during the holidays. Sunday and Monday were very rough and I was riddled with anxiety. Feeling better already with subtle anxiety but I’ve been here before. Longest I’ve gone without a drink in the past 4 years has been 15 days. I KNOW I can do better. 

Does anybody experience heightened anxiety on the verge of panic? How do you deal with it?",4.212607843137256,6.526039358823527,5.280588235294122,77.38931372549024,73.05882352941177,8.298039215686275,31.333333333333336,9.029198982220553,3.0691686274509817,721,34,123,16,15,237,115,170,0.09300000000000001,0.8320000000000001,0.075,-0.2351,2,0,2,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,0,4,5,6,1,2,12,0,14,4,0,1,0,19,24,9,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,4,9,2,1,3,3,0,4,2,3,0,0,9,3,12,3,22,13,3,29,0,0,0,0,4,8,0,0,16,79,16,1,0.1407358053523364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15530546082379834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3229875176510954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11975580467298184,0.0,0.0,0.2489387661204595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722888550087137,0.1450924356297833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14703896250394108,0.0,0.0,0.12315885166568573,0.0,0.0,0.2757350211292249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12465015094204428,0.14541770798110454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2753332454367107,0.0,0.0,0.14232050364790036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15430954644897385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599668028792797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12445220788593632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07734471806236771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529098643027224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359235177895982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16512314435773856,0.0,0.0,0.13434825079711316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347859985577344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14968985250490902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15899140119379687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2925567770770307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820641798683139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11612177846155625,0.08300962433579198,0.0,0.22577954800145825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356642941907266,0.0,0.10245734245185292,0.0,0.0,0.09997467821478108,0.0,0.0,0.09062924444227696
alcoholism,stillemo01,2020/01/03,"My (f/18) boyfriend (m/19) started drinking again which negatively affects my mental health We know each other for about 6 months now and at the beginning of our relationship he managed to stay sober for about 4 months. But now he has a bad phase of depression again and started again. On new years eve I saw him for the first time drunk, he got so drunk it really scared me off ( not that he was mean or something but I personally don't drink so I am kinda afraid of drunk people as they are unpredictable). I also have never been with such a drunk person so I was simply overwhelmed by the whole situation. After he puked, he straightly went to bed to sleep. I was lying next to him for the next few hours to control his breathing. All in all what happened that night was honestly not easy for me to handle, seeing the person you love the most like that hurts so bad. The next morning he told me that he is so sorry and that I shouldn't have seen him like that. I really love him and except of his drinking problem he is perfect to me but I'm afraid of what will happen next. He is such a great person and I don't want to leave him, as drinking was a result of his depression. He drinks for a reason and I can't blame him because I know what depression feels like. I'm just so afraid that he starts drinking daily again. Also what is happening right now triggered my depression and it just sucks. If someone has advice on how I could help him or how I should deal with that I would be very grateful!",3.4501365663322225,5.107720628762543,4.028616220735786,88.3690558807135,73.48160535117056,6.8562430323299886,23.829570791527313,7.492282038375204,0.9422808249721292,1184,34,242,14,24,374,154,299,0.177,0.679,0.14400000000000002,-0.8342,0,0,7,0,0,0,26.0,2,1,1,3,23,22,1,5,12,0,25,15,2,7,4,45,48,25,0,7,11,0,1,3,0,4,1,0,1,4,16,11,10,1,5,10,0,1,8,14,0,1,11,4,35,8,34,31,6,35,0,6,3,2,36,7,1,5,29,167,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08297040415388295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13580063052434688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417880521674571,0.05175868532672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523072608908126,0.06779154824348982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08753566983647522,0.2925220380709203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4990608159651045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042931668230008616,0.060657772546543476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0722220827413185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679081023652958,0.09361056784579626,0.0,0.0,0.22524966238186456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025246038404312,0.0,0.0,0.056911555088902985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361656029277371,0.0,0.0908949914659695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09332563306302248,0.0,0.0,0.08990454209416211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12444421375458588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15326425713602546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248891133592953,0.0,0.0,0.08556656042769635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355443499334376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06548572303512078,0.08200397301622102,0.36119939086177105,0.07967972360577699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05886401203297152,0.2965510218077371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124479294855129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087875460693202,0.08729881757064635,0.0,0.09115863516651956,0.0,0.07251034691777343,0.0,0.0,0.08500699211627556,0.0,0.0676601033205226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09543933193403913,0.08496859166701755,0.0,0.0719416565819592,0.0653657666801123,0.0,0.09504674027104702,0.1802934137913336,0.09049985537295853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049510113488502684,0.0,0.0,0.08113253763845205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07005739214531848,0.05008050928063793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07870989239625438,0.0,0.09479593770037947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0603156903820045,0.0,0.0,0.05467749979241431
alcoholism,hechosebooks,2020/01/03,"Finally bit the bullet and started antabuse - any tips/experiences? I've tried naltrexone but it just didn't make a difference. I'll be using counseling as well, but my drinking lately has been as bad as ever, and I'm so tired of living like this. I was prescribed antabuse today. I know it can have terrible consequences if you do drink, but I've also heard that topical creams, etc. with alcohol in them can have an effect. Anyone out there know more? What did you have to change in your daily life, if anything?",3.5753628117913863,5.901378010204084,4.4301360544217685,82.695022675737,75.0204081632653,8.029024943310658,26.19501133786848,8.841846274778883,2.205316099773244,407,15,75,9,9,131,77,98,0.139,0.804,0.055999999999999994,-0.8922,0,0,3,0,2,0,15.0,0,3,1,1,6,4,0,0,3,0,12,5,0,3,1,16,19,12,0,2,6,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,5,4,3,0,3,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,5,2,7,2,9,13,3,8,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,2,6,51,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2148303048937884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16075641380241962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1367011671210913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14055855081387142,0.0,0.16542314741899827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16784413075596372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21946285809159344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21265355394870994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21002415036216004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3938480831990741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22419154236182,0.0,0.18183499494540747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19663710201216675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2202086697115456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22095175890015134,0.0,0.22676043360252746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14198707077545145,0.09820870219529826,0.0,0.1775052178472379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13418307238481286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422836920141999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23104405766663255,0.1905443946134742,0.0,0.0,0.13648005746228267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17361759373614144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18074201247697652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,boozedues,2020/01/03,"3 weeks sober, what's next Hi alcoholism, thanks for your time!  

So me- 37m, 6'3 230lbs, and fit (believe it or not).  I've averaged ~4L/week of hard alcohol for like 8 years.  I 95% stopped drinking 3 weeks ago on a 'whim'- my guts were hurting.  That stopped almost immediately.  

So, my experience so far hasn't matched what i'd believed with recovering alcoholics.  I'm casually tempted to go buy some booze, but it wasn't a huge temptation after the first week.  I've had 1 beer in a social setting a few times, and there hasn't been any impulse to drink more.  I didn't feel bad in the slightest those first few days of sobriety, i felt awesome.  Like, damn i wish i'd stopped years ago.

I've only heard 'once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.'  I don't want to go back to nightly drinking, but i'd like to get drunk again in the future.  In the right setting.  Based on how i feel today and how easy it was to stop, it seems like it would be no big deal... but i don't know.

How long before my liver recovers, as much as it will?

How typical is my experience?

Is this all indicative that i didn't have a chemical dependency, just a psychological one?

Why didn't i have any withdrawls when i was drinking so much?  Just size and activity level?


I didn't intend to be here, and i'm sure i sound dumb.  Honestly, i'd appreciate any comments, anecdotes, insults, anything.  I don't really want to talk about this with people in the real world because... y'all prolly get why.

Thanks",2.179387755102041,4.300779013605446,3.957380952380955,85.39178571428573,78.59183673469389,7.465306122448977,25.806122448979593,8.418075326091056,1.7982530612244898,1146,45,238,24,28,385,170,294,0.11199999999999999,0.725,0.163,0.9664,0,0,10,0,0,0,54.0,0,2,0,2,16,14,3,0,13,0,23,14,2,6,2,38,40,20,0,4,7,0,4,4,0,2,5,2,0,0,13,7,12,4,5,7,1,2,12,5,0,3,12,6,20,9,25,24,7,43,0,1,0,0,9,14,2,5,29,130,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1564867276007707,0.4716528604469927,0.08838664361027844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07344520931467795,0.0,0.0,0.18007374666525275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07263621461868626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787186942148468,0.07369925245828603,0.053806739827383515,0.0,0.07510871009399332,0.19889335033131952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05692490850727805,0.0909993942615745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34587219920252416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17268411303498024,0.0,0.0,0.08926088783847427,0.0,0.08475015564367094,0.0,0.0,0.1501597187534342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09223172178630316,0.0,0.10032833276793536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07906988855762885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09449164186743453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04850923111502965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17249117747740472,0.0,0.0,0.07811351143582138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12977279235471034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09387294870043568,0.08283259380548029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400146710009667,0.05981199900149359,0.06713102583815085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06119321927635956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10046716243525684,0.056546096088626735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537952996236194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08035495558852387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997708390516909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29518063480258283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08319059655167355,0.0,0.0,0.07094566568902994,0.0,0.16252877670063634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10293838718986308,0.0,0.08366678882294337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10412431908872496,0.0,0.2832098312445355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592944647312644,0.0,0.1015026861413705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06270233950896212,0.0,0.0,0.11368209942625646

alcoholism,feloniousmav,2020/01/03,"I need help. I’m tired of feeling like a failure I’m 27F. I started drinking a little after me and my high school sweetheart started dating around 17/18 years old. His family was pretty big into drinking and my mom was always so strict about it since my dad and his family had a history of alcoholism. When me and bf would drink sometimes it would be great but if there was an argument things would go left FAST. We thought maybe it was just something we’d grow out of since it wasn’t frequent. 
When we turned 20 we got married and moved to another state. There were already infidelity issues and I never got any closure from that before we tied the knot so I was left still hurt and the drinking continued. I’d sometimes get violent and so would he when I provoked him enough (I know that was never right. I was hurt and I didn’t know how to process my emotions in a healthy way) 
The fiery arguments stopped but the cheating/lying didn’t so we called it quits after 6 years or marriage. That alone took a lot out of me because giving up on something/someone I cared so deeply about made me feel like a failure so the drinking continued. I don’t drink often but when I do it almost always ends in me blacking out, getting in trouble, giving the “I don’t remember” excuse and I hate who I’ve become because of it because now I’ve noticed the direct effect it’s had on everyone around me. I don’t want people thinking I’m a complete mess when I have a drink.

He goes without drinking for months and then something triggers him and he will drink nonstop for at least a week or sometimes even a month. He owns a business and he’s my primary guardian and whenever he drinks everything around him crumbles and I’ve always wondered why he can sit around while that happens and what it’s like for him.

alcoholism,22zxcvbn,2020/01/03,"Could two weeks of moderate (3-5 drinks) have resulted in withdrawals the next days as a non-drinker? Hi, 

I typically don't drink at all, but have drank almost nonstop in the last two weeks, roughly 3-5 regular, standard unit sized drinks each night, and though I'm not 100% sure if something else has occurred with respect to my medications which I had tapered off at a similar time (still attempting to determine) it's still odd.

 I've felt persistent anxiety and elevated heart rates in the daytime (palpitations even), somewhat ""wired"" in the daytime, sometimes trouble sleeping - all since about day 3. 

Does this seem unreasonable to expect withdrawals even as someone who does not drink and only recently began, or is this possible? Obviously there will always be some extent of withdrawals as the body adapts the next day, but I suppose I'm curious if it is possible to this extent for someone who seldom drinks (quite noticeable).",13.683453815261045,9.695368108433737,12.046987951807234,57.968995983935756,54.66265060240964,15.644979919678715,51.16064257028114,13.295006501635747,6.648938955823294,750,39,120,19,6,237,113,166,0.069,0.888,0.043,-0.5028,0,0,7,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,3,7,3,0,0,8,0,10,10,3,1,4,25,16,12,0,4,7,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,5,6,0,2,5,0,0,3,1,0,2,4,2,4,2,19,9,7,21,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,7,14,72,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10892306932958393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905100284312433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321305042617136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12082519045382305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08684848022549366,0.0,0.0,0.2104538254645555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19038055356350034,0.0,0.0,0.6393521689604781,0.0,0.0,0.09086807148039523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14369054027364322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444165206195363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12889963166540735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08866664717190557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1095799918706985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2313682086301324,0.1020785493066781,0.0,0.0,0.12384176263057682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272875949194515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.245256332060084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11569625973811905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10740280048762477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099025237762582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08998031568551595,0.0,0.10885417495815458,0.0,0.1843304571421276,0.08374078542286624,0.1075818680891443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737366989023478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10251973313662112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10687149289950226,0.0,0.06342793790199501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125159471322849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745064798448857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was at the store and the person in front of me had rolling rock. at one point that was my favorite beer but I later didn’t really like it. but for some reason I just thought it sounded amazing. a strong reaction I haven’t had in awhile. I’m bipolar and have kids now. I cant afford to mess up my stability if I drink. but for a moment I thought it would be worth it to escape ..::.

alcoholism,trustme24,2020/01/04,"My sister in law is destroying the family. Does narcissism and alcoholism go hand in hand?

When she contacts us, it’s always about her, she never asks about us.  She has told us to go to hell and then the next day acts as if everything is fine.

She has already  lost one of her children and is angry at that child because of it.  It’s everyone else’s fault. 

She has been coddled by her parents her entire life, and continues to be.  We believe she is going to try to move in with them, which will shorten their lifespan. 

She has alienated all of us, yet her dad gets mad at us for not checking on her more often. 

She has been fired from multiple jobs, and has no source of income, and has depleted her retirement. 

I believe we need boundaries and let face her consequences. We have been trying to help her for years, she won’t help herself. 

Sometime I feel sad for her and other times I feel extreme frustration. 

I know alcoholism is a disease, but she won’t get herself help. She admits she is an alcoholic, but won’t go to AA.  She says she just needs a better psychiatrist. She wants other people to solve her problems. 

I feel like just cutting her out of my life until she gets help.",3.154141630901286,5.0779776652360535,4.146633047210301,86.08321137339054,74.92274678111588,7.40678111587983,26.242274678111592,8.238735603445708,1.7259701287553653,928,34,183,16,20,300,133,233,0.10400000000000001,0.7829999999999999,0.113,0.6542,3,0,3,0,0,0,28.0,8,0,2,2,7,12,5,0,5,0,23,8,3,0,2,32,41,15,0,5,6,3,6,1,0,4,5,1,0,2,7,13,3,0,5,0,1,6,6,9,1,1,5,7,47,3,30,30,2,23,1,2,0,0,54,7,1,2,11,135,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3256095805011321,0.0,0.0,0.11207375125996903,0.0,0.08450587921840802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949446920112396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06190990398716807,0.0,0.0,0.22884620518174495,0.0,0.08982137912330504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06549766128685529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887565468611255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08484017082333895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970447294734287,0.09127538864426003,0.0,0.09574152932987956,0.0,0.15405504069613624,0.07255433268304701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.159182392169073,0.0,0.2308750713677116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722935398434851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007824184398858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05581460334629738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038517638917788,0.14346936317833578,0.04961698232655674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11086450546774704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10794198182339727,0.0,0.15061059155979425,0.07832916929869646,0.0,0.10800998647531204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881954058808336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112770125539758,0.0,0.0,0.07040876927721057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717900095707294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08076441955451354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044522699203674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0592203289770312,0.0,0.0,0.0970447294734287,0.0,0.1379048586869061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6108195998658994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05990259415635073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06540117356225142
alcoholism,jwbseven7,2020/01/04,"Social Pressure to Drink with Job Hello.  I am really trying to phase drinking out of my future and one big challenge is the type of career I have which involves wining and dining clients.   Also, the work atmosphere in general involves social events, nights out on the town with the boss and co-workers, etc.

I do realize that it is up to me and I realize that no one can ever make me do anything I don't want to do.

I just would like to hear any stories from people in sales or similar field that were faced with the same challenges and how they worked through it.

Thank you",4.555862831858409,5.727993469026552,5.060342920353981,83.94060287610621,70.06194690265487,7.7738938053097355,28.28429203539823,8.07648339933343,1.832983185840708,454,16,87,6,8,145,79,113,0.051,0.8809999999999999,0.068,0.2448,1,0,2,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,1,4,4,5,0,1,5,0,11,5,1,3,1,22,15,8,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,6,10,4,0,2,3,1,0,2,1,0,2,1,1,11,4,18,13,2,12,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,1,5,66,17,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15894142532426084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13515776964532658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16355547010843532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894014193537993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22166035211775628,0.0,0.17978202291806675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2240072762073008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1972300998216132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09709989627755446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326681049593656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865147281046655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26935818905678216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13778919783656773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12732523820415154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40520405239592944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829835889643328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13493915638136564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11722872707284505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43408016592065546,0.0,0.0,0.1411872943699458,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Dandelion-haze,2020/01/04,"I honestly have no idea what’s going on in my life because of drinking? Hi, I’m a 19yo f, I have been drinking pretty much consistently since I was 16 and hard since I was around 17. I’m a student in my second year of uni. I would love some advice or anything, sorry if I sound pathetic. 

I’m absolutely miserable if I don’t drink or get high, every second feels drawn out and agonising however if I do I can’t remember anything and can’t keep any control over my life.  I found out earlier that I have an assignment due in on the 13th. I had absolutely no idea. How? I don’t know. I’m so unmotivated and feel like I can’t do anything. 

I feel like my mind is playing tricks on me. I feel like it’s always a battle between happiness and being able to function. I don’t know what to do. My bf tries to control my drinking and I can’t drink whenever I’m around him, as he will lose his shit and I resent him so much for it. I’m always looking for an opportunity to get drunk or high. 

I have no idea whatsoever what sort of person I am, what I want or what other people think of me. All I know is that I just want to drink. My brain is fucked, I can’t think, can’t remember anything but it’s just so miserable and boring without drinking or getting high. I can only work occasionally and have no money, so finding hobbies would be difficult.",1.3503994708994682,3.311580235714292,4.005158730158732,84.81835978835981,80.57142857142857,7.005291005291006,24.656084656084666,8.045849151850463,1.5012830687830694,1046,40,222,20,27,369,133,280,0.162,0.763,0.075,-0.9645,1,0,7,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,5,9,18,5,2,6,0,31,14,2,3,1,53,57,24,0,7,12,0,5,3,1,3,2,1,0,1,11,13,8,3,16,9,1,1,14,10,0,2,5,7,38,8,25,47,4,17,0,3,1,2,8,14,2,10,5,146,49,3,0.08292921196653555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08103746614706751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13800749535363435,0.0,0.0,0.0563947079010953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2729747016866511,0.1476491613283102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050552877893683235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09257642689171136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18602432566898425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5686733937253206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06987143778938991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16772600525719575,0.17773393679679916,0.0,0.0,0.07579579734806449,0.0,0.0,0.0909276005057122,0.0,0.07666672015954347,0.12998127142654678,0.0,0.04713058226502189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827968820080764,0.07428828496475229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.262857796716984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28085095839553503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07371129396298168,0.0,0.0,0.1367271783316556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11715070984025708,0.12154507215165512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06963965179614877,0.09277657571965894,0.0,0.0,0.07484685157240407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373486362527532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12192502550565695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06307140263396181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05749267381601955,0.07241058916035817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843688221598343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878852621487313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512564435885071,0.13719980221109754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09283246328195244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10627538098668016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05630349130883624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09782759567931228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07994080099991008,0.0,0.060373453993785485,0.0,0.0,0.11782106565139465,0.0,0.0,0.05340369356543265

alcoholism,dxx17317,2020/01/04,"My mother needs help My mom is an alcoholic. Has been for at least the past decade. Most of my family wanted nothing to do with her especially after my father passed 5 years ago. My brother and I have 1 other family member willing to help us right now. She has been in detox 3 times within the past 1.5 years, the last time she was in detox, she immediately relapsed once she was released. 

She agreed to go to rehab because she would lose her job if she didn't. She only stayed 25 days out of the 40 days scheduled. She didn't complete the program, just went above her case manager's head to get a letter of ""participation"" instead. She's been home a week now and relapsed last night. 

We live in MA. I plan to section 35 her because I firmly believe she is a danger to herself and others. She doesn't have a police record yet but I have recently found out she would drive drunk and drink in her car which is terrifying. She has also admitted to wanting to die when she was intoxicated. 

When bringing her into detox at a local hospital, she has stated suicidal tendencies to the nurse questioning her. I believe that should be within her medical record or some sort of report somewhere we could access (either me or my brother are her proxy). 

I'm just trying to figure out where to begin, what my next steps should be. I have never done this before. I'm reading up on it now, wondering what kind of evidence I would need to bring since she doesn't have any sort of police record. I called her case manager and left a message. I haven't heard back yet.

I have already lost 1 parent, I refuse to lose another even if that means she hates me. Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",3.827696340919232,5.648903039156625,4.80856760374833,82.48859660865688,72.82530120481928,7.44863900044623,25.54930834448907,8.167268648758528,1.6023564033913429,1347,44,256,21,27,439,187,332,0.111,0.8440000000000001,0.046,-0.9749,2,0,2,0,0,0,35.0,3,1,0,4,14,8,2,0,13,0,38,10,1,0,1,44,58,14,2,13,9,7,0,0,0,7,7,1,1,0,9,12,3,1,6,3,0,8,6,5,0,0,13,1,53,3,37,34,5,56,0,3,0,0,49,19,0,11,27,181,62,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038139558226994,0.09417304336778942,0.11353546965269358,0.0,0.0,0.11723561050129025,0.08495800883289717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1444901474104198,0.11139917485801816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169000145225015,0.0,0.12952266357491632,0.0,0.09040020098094914,0.23938633510314444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10848026145562256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113878905975609,0.0,0.0,0.08482191772200365,0.0,0.0,0.13702866587484164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11025764644713823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10871774303530472,0.0,0.10407220508281494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07016879945898867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2003023279782866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1164838234802786,0.0,0.0,0.05550465569084237,0.0,0.060377161549937435,0.0,0.0,0.11712710639395504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488743617153573,0.1090302198827406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14241737704067814,0.0,0.10656477230563564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10542422485876704,0.0,0.0,0.11062990181106827,0.0,0.1731953174442219,0.0,0.0,0.1154272438207281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09380956883179732,0.0,0.0,0.23770494787343574,0.11597066962884264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11572367102985122,0.0,0.10702300178772513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12442395659914557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15754736904019132,0.08193683069901499,0.0,0.11298467805629875,0.0996966013451426,0.0,0.10193764866123804,0.0,0.0,0.1131393617027702,0.0,0.0807983284526072,0.0,0.0,0.1179640581789189,0.0,0.2028312348894108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11901019937948272,0.0,0.10626614739221717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10489661399279017,0.0,0.0,0.09072615745789464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08788067348858855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11323493097881115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11620647043218199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09780912267391173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123895762275414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07212821966559944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277905091805568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12532313976429202,0.0,0.08521723256945597,0.0,0.0,0.09848313233329924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11520992639421775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3018719978810658,0.0,0.0,0.13682680242023887

alcoholism,Letmetellyowhat,2020/01/04,"Made my one year mark Today is one year since I quit. Three months of AA followed by just being alive and not drinking. It hasn’t all been smooth sailing. At times I would feel my mouth water watching a commercial. But, I did it.   


now what?  That’s an honest question I have asked myself. I'm proud of myself for making this year. But, I’m not sure what I want for this next year. I know that I won’t panic so much if something is cooked in alcohol. I know I can walk away from a drink. what I don’t know is if I will ever pick up a drink again. For today, I won’t, I work all weekend. What about Monday?  And how will I feel when my family stares at me if I have that Bloody Mary.   


I took some good things from AA and one day at a time is one of them. I carry my chip with me. Like a talisman. For this one day I won’t drink. I don’t want to pick up another 24 hou

so, I made my year, no real fan fair. No parades. Just me not drinking for one more day.",-0.5930767630538796,1.2835253444976082,1.5606116080715644,100.05862908258793,87.42105263157896,4.5917204077387135,15.307052215519034,5.7926816847441245,-0.9335556064073224,723,13,182,5,23,241,113,209,0.077,0.8240000000000001,0.099,0.7472,1,0,7,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,1,3,10,6,0,1,6,0,19,9,1,6,4,35,34,12,0,6,10,0,3,1,0,6,1,0,0,0,13,4,8,0,6,7,0,3,11,1,2,7,5,5,31,5,21,22,5,30,0,0,2,0,3,7,0,5,21,124,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11415988331349515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201183948869396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09986384563277152,0.0,0.10036247938781782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066734284192664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5232228670377647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662632008803664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10070196767306074,0.0,0.10802449634718607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08959695230825322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761191957514332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05218767430660206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021545021827421,0.07130429709937736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08526404131223414,0.0,0.07852622169215677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11360606251575828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4343107865572747,0.0,0.0,0.12533221881112672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11966472253858525,0.11361799959008168,0.0,0.12158645162861127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836399287075677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223654373429637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10067816387372937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07096757385487071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12457715467830666,0.0,0.20250891386919728,0.0,0.11868281066010425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12601238234832984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07776745115246687,0.0,0.0,0.07588305258068867,0.0,0.0,0.3439482799127732

alcoholism,ExplosiveTumbleweed,2020/01/04,"Horrible digestive issues that don’t go away when I’m sober. I started drinking heavily over 10 years ago. I was also drinking a lot of soda with booze. I developed some horrible digestive issues as a result. I’ve now been diagnosed with IBS and GERD.

It constantly feels like my digestion is on fast forward and food often travels right through me. I get hot flashes, cold chills, itchy skin, feel sensitive to touch and other unpleasantness after eating, when I exercise, when I take a shower, after waking up from a nap ect. All of which trigger my IBS.

I’ve managed to get sober a few times. My record is 3 months. In that time I saw practically no improvement in my symptoms. I’ve tried diets, medications, supplements ect. and nothing helps my symptoms.

I’m worried I’ve done some permanent damage to my gut. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? My digestion was never as bad as this before I started drinking.",4.296206140350879,6.875764771929827,5.484557748538013,74.77666118421052,73.79532163742691,8.719444444444445,31.15533625730994,9.354420925462401,3.4218915204678355,740,35,120,19,16,245,113,171,0.11199999999999999,0.8240000000000001,0.064,-0.7926,1,0,3,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,0,6,4,0,0,5,0,8,20,3,2,2,16,19,11,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,9,0,1,0,7,6,12,0,2,6,0,3,3,2,0,0,5,8,16,2,20,14,5,26,0,1,1,0,1,8,0,4,19,73,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328516743176505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11985185268000614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10479334744157943,0.153560637723241,0.12333113326783053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408088179910265,0.0,0.12513609601475614,0.0,0.0,0.12752925497020728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1619574004126186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15211599670691867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15337015427937692,0.0,0.4404498209063161,0.0,0.15335553550743825,0.12519806063914812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15155864758926574,0.10706793320583688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18122471110911406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15660291262234502,0.0,0.08517519149434223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045542925638136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3128529504173043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464388838864272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12741503718834002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15097935109170865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11962567034559575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558982015833652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14380534828591865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12798908787109134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21215905096032425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3115468842533373,0.11268440437666095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1747820700119816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017526290480242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15220136192667058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965120651462163

My hangovers aren’t that bad anymore, but I usually feel a bit depressed for a couple days afterwards. 

This doesn’t seem to effect my friends the same way and, honestly, I haven’t asked them about it cause I don’t wanna seem like a pussy.

alcoholism,throwaway1699968,2020/01/05,"Newly sober father! I (32F) am the youngest of 8 and for as long as I can remember my parents have always been alcoholics. My mother stopped drinking about 8 years ago and I'm really proud of her but, my father continued. Recently he received his second OVI and is now on probation. At any moment they can test his blood, hair or urine to see if he's drank. If he gets caught, he goes to jail. The last 5 weeks my father has been sober. I've never met sober Dad before and it's a HUGE change. He's doing dishes, spending time with us, cleaning his room (parents don't sleep in the same room) and so much more. Yesterday he gifted my son with a picture of him photoshopped onto the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and I was shook. So here's my question, how do I best support my father on this new journey even though it's been forced upon him? After his probation is up, I don't want him to relapse.

alcoholism,sirahs123,2020/01/05,Alcoholic father in law. This is my first time posting. I got married 3 years ago and moved in with my in laws. I knew my FIL was an alcoholic before we got married however I didn’t realize how bad it actually was. He goes on 1-2 week benders of straight drinking and not going to work. During this time we have to be extra quiet so he doesn’t wake up and the mood in the house is very negative and stressed my husband out which he takes out on me. I am so sick of this cycle. I don’t know what to do. Rehab is out of the question. My mother In law has co dependency issues and also doesn’t know what to do. Any suggestions?

alcoholism,charmedlobster,2020/01/05,"Do other people lie as much as I do when drinking? I lie so much when I get blackout drunk. About everything but it's mostly about what I did &amp; do as a career, my earning potential, and then when they mention it the next day, I have to lie being sober. 

I had met someone that I really liked, went on a couple of dates and got blackout drunk and made up ridiculous lies. The guy ghosted me. I texted him and he finally said because it was lie after lie. My heart fell into my stomach. I felt so ashamed. The only thing I could do was sincerely thank him, own up to it, and admit I needed to be sober. 



I experienced some physical withdrawals that woke me into sobriety-cant sleep, night sweats, diarrhea, slight shaking",3.7522823984526106,5.326970340425532,4.807672469374598,83.4245454545455,72.54609929078015,7.68046421663443,27.711798839458407,8.296473431620573,1.930327659574468,562,21,108,9,11,184,93,141,0.126,0.7809999999999999,0.09300000000000001,-0.5923,0,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,1,1,7,6,1,2,5,0,12,7,4,1,0,15,23,15,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,9,7,3,0,2,3,0,3,0,3,0,0,11,3,20,3,15,9,5,18,0,0,0,0,9,5,0,2,11,78,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22539212632421576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12680849208416134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16608891733905234,0.23017277057328495,0.0,0.13415720471068351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2037827053609352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18695707234134007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19973407561114614,0.22787831334991696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10868309062738224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1663744742912646,0.0,0.0,0.20597482899489544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.246507483068492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10162921124706058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968357747288542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3058407211595602,0.15424593463720734,0.0,0.0,0.22123412625230107,0.19521488106490198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15821036892234136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442165031203291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13326444235886606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978768888638676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20817257849180645,0.0,0.17625665975880664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19151902865523684,0.0,0.0,0.1382008041327034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19283879997861844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Fivesidedcoin,2020/01/05,"I decided to stop drinking and two days in, my SO wants me to have drinks and try to control After several times telling her I can’t control my drinking and that I have to stop, she decided that it’s not fun if I don’t drink. For example we are going to a restaurant with friends and she’s concerned that our friends would feel uncomfortable if I don’t drink with them. So, she’s inviting me back to drinking with her and to see if I can try to control it. Obviously this is all messed up. She really does care about me but obviously not as much as I had thought ? What should I say to her here?  This is crazy because like two days ago I experienced the “straw that broke the camels back” when I got wasted alone with our three year old son and was followed home by some folks that saw me stumbling around the city dangerously crossing roads etc and spoke to our doorman about my behavior (I thankfully arrived safely) and they told him that they were about to call the cops etc. I was so embarrassed. I promised myself and my wife that this was it. And now, she’s pulling me back in. I’m just going to tell her “no” and that if she loves me truly then she has to cope with it.

She was good for about a month, but then went on another bender for the past few days. It’s been about 4-5 days and I’m trying to get her to stop.

alcoholism,BiebsVsDevito,2020/01/05,Advice please Throwaway account just because. So my mom has been getting drunk about 3 times a week for about 5 months. She goes to therapy and we told her in a caring way it’s ruining our relationship. She told us on November 10 or 11 that she would try to stop and we deserve better. 2 months later and nothing has gotten better. She does have depression and takes pills but nothing seems to be helping. She gets really annoying when she’s drunk and says stuff like “background” and “history”. I don’t know how to help her. I really need advice.,3.8264761904761895,5.910528980952384,4.693333333333332,82.19333333333334,73.47619047619048,8.095238095238095,26.904761904761905,8.841846274778883,2.219190476190476,433,16,80,9,9,140,78,105,0.125,0.723,0.152,0.4607,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,4,0,0,2,6,7,1,0,2,0,7,3,0,1,0,17,17,11,0,2,3,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,8,2,1,2,2,1,0,1,3,0,0,4,1,15,4,9,11,0,10,0,2,0,0,19,2,0,2,8,48,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3150964519681041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09828190106640454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28518267120796703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1643806988337054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13886375699049802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14108999915236345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16846790912933834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21613283998522506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08860561833981186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0787669021299552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1888259962426539,0.25737818312381056,0.0,0.0,0.11954707006410795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094014784484693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769777830025086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20657106672147785,0.0,0.0,0.17309643601320765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12821342275038114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14677413685873314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347921935033388,0.0,0.0,0.18456524943393496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12122192160372522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18437603434797128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09401220384458787,0.0,0.0,0.30811679188197016,0.0,0.1094619019345614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19393508184371905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279737306919225,0.12932580892609194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11453035712666765,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,yasqueen2017,2020/01/05,"My husband just admitted to me that he suffers from alcoholism Long story short, my husband admitted to me finally, of his own volition that he is dependent on alcohol. I’ve known this for quite some time, but I know that this is something he has to come to terms with himself and I can’t make him change or give him to desire to stop. Obviously I suggest ways he can work on it, offering up different ways to cope, etc. He also suffers from depression and anxiety which he opened up about a few months ago and has since gone on medication and began seeing a therapist. These have helped, but the overall addiction has always been there. Far before we were together he has struggled with this, but it would come in waves. He can go days/weeks without a drink, but he can never just have 1. Fights have escalated due to alcohol, I get impatient with drunk behavior from him, and I get embarrassed if it happens when we are around other people. The most important part is, I’m 5 months pregnant with our first child. I want to support him as best I can, but I can’t convince him to change. What is the best first step I can take? Suggesting meetings to go to together, confiding in family to help? I’m unsure of how to deal with any of this while still being supportive.",6.018829931972789,6.459119889795923,6.625714285714286,76.65095238095239,66.42857142857143,10.941496598639457,33.06802721088435,10.793553405168565,3.609606802721089,1003,41,191,27,15,329,146,245,0.127,0.748,0.125,-0.1829,1,0,5,0,1,0,27.0,3,0,0,6,9,11,1,2,6,0,23,7,0,3,2,41,44,17,0,4,10,2,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,14,16,5,1,4,2,0,6,4,6,0,2,4,1,23,5,37,38,9,35,0,3,1,0,33,11,0,5,16,134,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130615583709344,0.0,0.0,0.10620840102402293,0.3841360625109143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581568089593144,0.09969533344817932,0.0,0.0,0.08147802689275177,0.0,0.09165783011303996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10666038343969024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10195338766890584,0.0,0.25147603143785896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25349588964553843,0.2064193129430305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235235768151992,0.10319612709679506,0.0,0.0,0.1251807408211601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11737268009616655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13362493461012706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11295052817226695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13125102214292764,0.0,0.20382845077707012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12519635172647775,0.11493706822613588,0.136186780362273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10595164244016596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16061838242236773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06584696287823334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10603213799876864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07997716632980391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12070058995834967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19126971841475088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240839482623098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12974752046622595,0.0,0.08306434766065819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12743756016010013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954767123556568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09911186342024583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09223912168237956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09568408291028956,0.10017035858664086,0.0,0.12525621950851748,0.0,0.0,0.27192834396902826,0.0,0.0,0.0900856573367214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13911396870530054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06986484844465032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07066974693433466,0.19020648243642616,0.09610803354359794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11549698502068648,0.0,0.08722644537393602,0.0,0.0,0.0851128440323969,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,tomriddleforlife,2020/01/05,"Can an alcoholic just stop loving their significant other by quitting alcohol? My alcoholic ex and I broke up a couple months ago. He was actively drinking throughout our relationship. One week after he stopped drinking, he went from all the “i love you” and “I can’t imagine my life without you” to “i don’t love you anymore”, and has been like that ever since. He’s been sober (or dry? he refuses to get help and claims he can do it on his own) for a little over a month now.

It’s killing me to think that the love was genuine on my end, but it was only because of alcohol on his end and that’s why he was able to stop so easily the moment he quit drinking. I don’t know too much about how recovery works, so i don’t know if this is for now while he’s detoxing, or if this is for real. Does it really work like that?

Or tingling on the back of my head / upper neck. I took a half day break a couple times and it seemed to get worse the more hungover I got.

alcoholism,Captain-Crouton,2020/01/06,"New here and scared of what my actions of drinking have turned into Hi there, I just need some guidance. 21 year old male in college. 

Small backstory: I found myself starting to drink harder and much more often once my ex-girlfriend cheated on me in July. I was piss drunk for about 2 weeks straight and have found myself drinking every day since it happened, and haven’t gone without a drink maybe 5-7 days since July. Before this all happened, I only drank on the weekends. Now I can’t even imagine not drinking in some sort of way. 

It stirred me into confusion about my future and if I should even stay in school. It has really deterred my grades and have had many drunken mistakes that would’ve never happened before. 

I knew this became a problem once I started missing work from being too hungover and sleeping through work. I didn’t even tell them I wasn’t coming in, only to continue to drink for the rest of the day. 

All I think about is when I can drink next and how much of my money I am putting towards booze this week. 

I want to figure out ways to curb this. It sounds like I’m becoming an alcoholic and would love some actual guidance from people who may have experience with this. 

Anything helps, thank you.",5.343813559322033,6.410292152542375,5.162500000000001,84.32137711864408,68.15254237288136,7.255932203389831,30.00423728813559,7.1686216300943375,1.7176830508474574,972,36,181,8,16,300,149,236,0.09,0.846,0.064,-0.7096,0,0,8,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,1,2,14,10,2,2,6,0,18,14,2,1,3,42,37,12,0,7,4,0,0,1,0,3,1,1,0,1,12,14,11,1,6,9,1,4,7,7,0,0,9,1,25,3,31,24,9,37,0,1,0,1,8,13,1,8,18,124,37,5,0.0,0.0,0.08962668537204183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09815351256309077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755799466301746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10143469724729737,0.1563052901411768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911564131905469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17769572256044402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6298064176964983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1819866732476614,0.0,0.07738269526760175,0.0,0.0,0.08984124596510328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20140483791264474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2436525542386927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06156122773493543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04487043431557205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289297158053137,0.0,0.0,0.09311559793976648,0.0922698383050246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13503210170997118,0.06810130663867582,0.07083590499072558,0.08870369558756667,0.09767734304495022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09637503251255433,0.19562213983424456,0.0,0.1397032975000613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06367320036314246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08788249052710694,0.0,0.09232878324037944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05883774294900655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09195206127397304,0.09295122839422656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15194893394463374,0.0,0.09191052350895848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001558749863798,0.09789369132314828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08027587439070641,0.08455779485059732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05885005147689516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099900110141728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054172085652743784,0.14580329356248306,0.1473437461118475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08853452625191856,0.0,0.13372733524493485,0.0,0.0,0.13048696159492015,0.0,0.0,0.05914465017586613
alcoholism,necbasster,2020/01/06,"Is this what being an alcoholic can be like? I've been drinking since I was about 15 and am 25 now. Ever since that age I have had the issue of blacking out and/or passing out from getting so drunk almost every time i drink from getting so easily and mindlessly carried away. I know I'm not a lightweight because the nights that that miraculously doesn't happen I've consumed a pretty decent amount. But the thing is, I feel compelled socially and habitually that I have to drink if I'm going out somewhere on a weekend night and I almost get anxiety thinking about not. I've definitely done some dumb stuff on alc and gotten myself into trouble but it doesnt regularly interfere with my life, just on the weekends.

alcoholism,KeshasRainbow,2020/01/06,"Help staging an intervention for a friend      I wasn’t sure what community I should post this in as I am more of a lurker than poster on Reddit, but I believe I need to stage an intervention for my friend who is going downhill fast. 
     I’ve known they struggle with alcohol issues and severe depression for years, but this past Friday I saw them get worse than before and absolutely disrespect my husband and I’s home while forcing us to take care of them. 
     At the time I tried not to be mad because I was trying to make sure they didn’t choke on their vomit, but now that time has passed my husband and I realize we need to have a talk with them about how they are recklessly out of control. 
     I’m mad at them for how they acted and want to set some boundaries, but at the same time I’m extremely concerned about my friend and want to help them. We normally talk daily, but since this the only discussion we have had was myself stating we need to set boundaries and them saying they understand. 
     I’ve never staged an intervention, but I know my friend needs help.

alcoholism,idolovetodrink,2020/01/06,"110 Days Hey all,

It's been 70 days since my last post, and I now have 110 days sober.  I have learned so, so much.  I've seen some of the lows of cravings rearing up, some of the highs of self-awareness, and as I walk this path it just keeps getting better all the time.  I have so much to say, but you already know it, and this probably isn't the place.  Since I began my journey two of my closest, oldest friends- drinking buddies, of course- have also begun their own walks to recovery, inspired by nothing but the changes they've seen in me.

I am not the person I was 70 days ago, or 110 days ago, or the person I was through 22 years of drink.  I am a new person, more like I once was but mature and confident, and for the first time in my life I understand what it feels like to love myself, to accept myself, to forgive myself, to love others without judgment as well.  

Thank you all so much.",5.5047540983606575,4.784465076502733,5.732792349726776,86.55558196721312,67.63387978142076,8.19431693989071,30.86830601092896,6.742157984588678,1.5574922404371585,691,23,150,4,10,220,105,183,0.018000000000000002,0.7509999999999999,0.231,0.9932,0,0,2,1,0,0,28.0,0,2,1,2,8,12,0,0,9,0,11,5,0,0,3,26,22,17,0,0,8,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,3,8,5,2,1,7,2,0,3,3,1,1,2,7,4,22,11,22,15,10,28,0,1,2,2,12,7,0,4,19,103,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22921723203177904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426757656631752,0.1033939168109591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434732839104425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13677266957168696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4169097968164134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25331179632117323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06537338326619016,0.09236547230155884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997480624408908,0.0,0.0,0.09988985836896186,0.0,0.06754917908219274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13660297509568592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11491972670307375,0.0,0.0,0.07105491855222479,0.10538937111330644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09132201345342418,0.1263300436320145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333802397121362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.285131148621786,0.0,0.0,0.12486999407100975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12405814249148997,0.0,0.0,0.13769062990812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3386755815559003,0.13508151256426382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12382497977143606,0.0,0.13939749925069522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028173436575065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348786461667112,0.0,0.0,0.2139016007741416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11903372539003584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507811719449602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12629846021129776,0.13459642667360072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11624808093354325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1246318509609685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325912542732368

alcoholism,iwannabehave,2020/01/06,I’m an alcoholic I’m writing this drunk. Please forgive me. I just have hit a wall in my life. I am drunk every day. I can count MAYBE 3 or 5 times I have had a sober night in the past 5 years. I’m 24. The last sober night I had wasn’t by choice and it was because I couldn’t access alcohol. Worst night of my life. From night sweats to panic to waking up gasping for air. It was quite troubling. I need help. I know I do. It makes my family uncomfortable. How do I help myself without losing the ones I love? I want to get better. I want to be sober in the 20s.

alcoholism,charliesburrito,2020/01/06,"Drunk anecdotes Anyone else find it awful when everybody starts telling their drunk stories? Like I know it's a funny part of life and what happens while drunk is mostly always a good crazy anecdote for friends to share. But it's always hard to hear them because you kinda wanna start drinking again, and like heavy drinking to get a good anecdote. I don't know, I know it's no one's fault but still, it makes it a little harder.",3.1085714285714303,5.460749619047622,3.1145238095238104,91.43464285714286,76.61904761904762,4.6761904761904765,23.595238095238088,5.148860815047168,0.27905238095238083,344,11,65,1,8,104,58,84,0.161,0.6829999999999999,0.156,0.1406,0,0,2,0,0,0,7.0,0,1,2,0,3,7,0,0,4,1,2,6,0,1,0,12,11,6,0,1,2,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,7,2,5,0,4,5,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,2,6,6,6,11,2,7,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,2,8,37,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31879662919786617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13394744886608753,0.19628207487831728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167768969899875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753236333175704,0.0,0.0,0.1600288685781757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17508791562378856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14800346892286664,0.0,0.1000853639228197,0.0,0.0,0.3213530580658617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16940124126000067,0.0,0.1716055695016269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21590888121367705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31583910323258724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13530877909751055,0.18717900888049446,0.1919995263299576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278718379130121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12981012543354273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20744738364767146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27118289780587784,0.0,0.15298490934655945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16743718703267388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,user172773839393,2020/01/06,"i’m 17, and i’m an alcoholic. over the past year, i have had a really hard time being sober; i feel like i need to drink all of the time. it’s been hard for me to go anywhere without at least a little bit of alcohol flowing through my system, and i’ve ruined a lot of relationships. 
this new year’s eve i got blackout drunk and yelled at my boyfriend until he went home in tears. i woke up new year’s day alone and confused. i didn’t remember any of what i had said, but i hurt him.  badly. i want this to be the last time i let alcohol hurt the ones i love. i’m just lucky that he’s a forgiving and understanding person. not everyone i fought with was. 
there have been so many events like that over the past year. too many. punching through windows, going to work and school drunk, getting in fights, and changing into someone i know i’m not. i know i’m better than this but i don’t know why i can’t stop drinking. i don’t know why i can’t drink like everyone else.  why can’t i just drink for fun and not drink just to numb myself? i just need some help and support.. i don’t know where to start with keeping myself sober.",1.2952673796791458,3.0813366092437,2.7593430099312464,94.54782276546983,79.96638655462183,6.007944996180291,21.322383498854087,6.980632752743323,0.3201025210084034,875,25,203,10,22,285,125,238,0.16399999999999998,0.6990000000000001,0.13699999999999998,-0.3734,0,1,8,0,1,0,27.0,0,0,0,2,8,17,2,1,10,0,17,12,0,0,1,41,44,13,0,3,10,0,3,3,0,0,4,2,2,1,7,12,10,2,9,7,0,4,11,8,0,1,11,5,27,9,27,30,5,33,0,3,0,1,11,10,0,4,21,115,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29898764081537577,0.0,0.09658532783027086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06341743308274643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07786505524944998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824775554746524,0.1018116480662041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09865272412344901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06014255230740467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4567780031994987,0.0,0.0,0.07790361230097588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17822064494644638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04715315102477903,0.06662226807470338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048722530236702304,0.0,0.10599932717746552,0.0,0.07458552482707252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16707852619244348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06250768401974897,0.0,0.09354360055394896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996654421639744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289042050786563,0.0,0.0,0.2562559208465522,0.07601627274325759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953608116589506,0.0,0.13668084766452826,0.09346723996785093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07928311035938747,0.08416738693587596,0.0,0.0,0.18909435654500006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13829662316129074,0.0,0.18013489266475674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06319283373284375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17804724399862326,0.0,0.08142774142234843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05974232776070176,0.0,0.0,0.10012228894043064,0.10564112735939908,0.0,0.08870802849974667,0.0,0.0,0.09438028167226786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07901569954392686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06600723832214045,0.0,0.0,0.07796638253040619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10582606264911894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16313536986751626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09708302243580308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055004939590424455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08644945785522634,0.25244772267368376,0.0,0.0,0.08989567614897571,0.0,0.06789164482135386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2402158137956447
alcoholism,phonetagged,2020/01/06,"New Dad Drinking Too Much I’ve struggled on and off with drinking excessively, though probably in the functional alcoholic category. Now that I’m a new dad, I’ve probably slipped into the worst drinking habits of my life. 

After years of being together, my partner and I decided to have a kid. In the months leading up to his birth, I was really working hard on myself — working out and not drinking. I lost a bunch of weight and it felt amazing and empowering. But in the four months since the baby has been born, I’ve fallen hard into old habits worse than ever — drinking every day, often in secret from my partner. I love the life ahead as a dad for the most part, but also am scared to face such a big life change. I feel ashamed that I let myself use the crutch of drinking to deal with the bigness of the situation and my self-doubt about being able to rise to the challenge of fatherhood. I woke up this morning, trying conceal yet another hangover, and vowed that I had to get this shit back under control — not only for my health but so this beautiful little kid has the kind of caring, loving dad he deserves. 

Your stories and this community has been helpful and encouraging. I think I’m 24 hours sober and trying hard not to sneak out to the corner store right about now.",6.203536585365852,6.655454394308947,6.539333333333335,77.38900000000002,66.03252032520325,9.161626016260163,32.25365853658536,9.029198982220553,2.709397073170731,1015,39,186,16,15,328,142,246,0.1,0.778,0.122,0.8683,2,0,7,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,0,7,13,13,1,3,18,0,12,16,2,3,1,33,24,17,0,0,6,4,6,0,2,0,5,0,0,4,8,16,8,1,5,6,1,3,3,6,0,1,7,6,18,7,41,14,5,39,0,1,0,2,17,19,1,2,17,130,26,4,0.10029728532119933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10718729565615476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08020770283495199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10517044874068383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712242143005317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10225976684862444,0.0,0.10610122892439043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11249193393900077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468345164478137,0.10340209712713694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5895189362367695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09072463670097572,0.08450478866955563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05071332105463125,0.0,0.09630112262304644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052401191962535267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2695400017597777,0.0,0.0,0.10661132418392978,0.0,0.0,0.06722715617476231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09877262269178108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444418849993296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10256076958990988,0.2125288162964349,0.0,0.1005242289341171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10948633489581988,0.0,0.18104443173969006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16011267250292752,0.0,0.07373004506463929,0.0,0.0,0.1937354863103162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10524512912520263,0.0,0.0,0.07628060505554303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086121861037549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21627487459010966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0642530092355302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08565333364924771,0.0,0.0,0.10041507960941227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10463194261515332,0.0,0.10295372207149253,0.08296695086124449,0.11273835099255065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10485249949306873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06426645060694358,0.09854157359094624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361905460927516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08662465176924876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221350732752374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14603523649747208,0.0,0.10221150237910613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06458816337118341
alcoholism,mugmar,2020/01/06,"3rd day sober and no this wasn’t a New Year resolution. Today is my third day sober by choice. I’ve been drinking since the age of 17. I’m now 31 and I would classify myself as a functioning alcoholic for the most part, but it’s definitely cost me a lot in life as in being hungover, late to work, stop caring, lost relationships etc.... I found two beers in my refrigerator from my last bender and was going to drink them, but I didn’t in fear of starting over and losing my will-power to start over again and if I did, would I ever stop. I’ve progressively drank more and more over the years. I guess what I’m getting at is how long does it take for the thirst, anxiety, and all the bullshit that comes with it to go away and how do you live life without it?",4.210000000000001,4.523265063694269,5.264210191082803,85.2842133757962,70.3375796178344,8.572993630573249,25.25414012738853,8.548686976883017,1.3283202547770698,593,15,133,9,10,196,104,157,0.154,0.7979999999999999,0.048,-0.9455,1,0,4,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,1,4,5,4,0,1,8,0,11,8,1,2,2,26,25,15,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,7,10,6,2,1,3,1,3,4,3,0,2,8,0,14,1,23,14,7,29,0,2,0,0,3,9,0,4,17,89,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16311332161806158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167602934047658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14339938780259778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15561480618071638,0.0,0.0,0.13147583525550607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968653577257358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13356612441673466,0.0,0.0,0.299035413533806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17022098987101594,0.0,0.1380611084018735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717493614024364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16734914138076526,0.0,0.0,0.07974202936487655,0.0,0.17348445204669058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.168137368718221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12441250123613422,0.17217146135293515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2156118779652892,0.0,0.0,0.13477365636061042,0.13507131390523194,0.0,0.17075211707535495,0.16661190719778374,0.1297591911524858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14740944108123707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652816626740341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638657611987529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126255773659152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2160623067401182,0.0,0.0,0.2552083208736759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475754738274507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14467385845061526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14909575008533282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14712831235203602,0.0,0.11111527887966667,0.0,0.0,0.21684564492702085,0.0,0.0,0.19657534599024665
alcoholism,Smok3B1ueC4eese,2020/01/06,"No longer has a hold on me Today I broke up with my girl friend of 3 years for my own mental health. I realised that she wasn't good for my recovery. She has far too much baggage and I have my own problems. I feelnits best to be single through this than tonhave someone elses problems in my life. The best thing I can do for myself right now is take care of myself on every level. Mentally, emotionally, physically, the whole point of my recovery for me is learning new ways to cope with my life. She came by this evening asked me if I had been drinking I told her I did she blew up on me then she lost her wallet holding more than $500 dollars and took it on me. Though I did get some sleep and I was sobering I didn't blow up on her I kept my cool. She left and honestly it's tge happiest day of my life most recently. She is an addict as well she goes to groups lives in a ""sober house"" and stillbgets high from time to time....right. Again its better for me to be single and away from her so we can recover away from each other.",1.0476659619450324,3.1322201534883685,2.4911310782241003,94.6087050739958,82.34883720930233,5.583509513742072,20.935517970401694,6.782984794422108,0.26393023255813963,803,24,181,9,22,260,130,215,0.075,0.795,0.13,0.9371,0,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,1,0,0,4,7,13,0,0,5,1,18,7,1,0,0,20,27,11,0,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,1,8,11,1,3,1,1,1,2,3,4,1,0,12,1,42,9,36,13,12,30,0,2,0,0,18,18,0,3,9,137,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14621746428383256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12538998435023374,0.0,0.2520321471709756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2815145528639905,0.11862381228488628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534047550196984,0.13675070143015866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08650036721129671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13139271113352766,0.0,0.0,0.11204531255470587,0.1508740340759707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08858915587081896,0.0,0.11300719218219595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10362564630982367,0.0,0.07007545565071355,0.0,0.0,0.11249877647485422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14256998438234308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417117995087044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547637415273093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1457286168983129,0.0,0.28421211585277306,0.0,0.0,0.11843597980141628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464147000861466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2703355261877014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09859826293161802,0.0,0.0,0.1295400158894701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12679270651646965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566815090144529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13243353967826818,0.0,0.0,0.2290862539067797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13422316394931394,0.0,0.11364477834382927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10084628503004064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910755357608724,0.0,0.13177840830149284,0.0,0.15642024775364133,0.0,0.12713604898722522,0.1281634270666272,0.14901925393536655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10646321350938458,0.0,0.0,0.12059565120735195,0.0,0.0,0.1497472235099551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637293940020188

alcoholism,wandringstar,2020/01/07,"Anhedonia, Masochism, &amp; Philip K Dick Hello, everyone! Just as a note, I already posted this to r/stopdrinking and I’ll likely be posting something similar to the AA Reddit as well. I would crosspost but it doesn’t seem that is allowed in these subs (understandably.)

Yesterday I read this passage from VALIS by Philip K. Dick and it seemed very interesting to me. This morning I went to an AA meeting and I realized why: the experience of anhedonia/disillusionment (nothing is fun or meaningful or happy) that I have been feeling is very real. Not only because I’ve been numbing myself with alcohol, but because I’ve been actively destroying myself to feel a sense of control. Giving myself an excuse not to try. I could easily drink myself to death in the struggle to escape my own feelings of existential dread and helplessness. From small things like not being able to control alcoholism (so I binge drink and make the question irrelevant) to less tangible things like struggling to cope with my mortality or feelings of impotence.

Even sometimes the disease itself can be a crutch, something for us to focus on. I don’t really have a relationship with a “higher power” yet (I’m only a week sober...hopefully it will come) but I really feel like this seems to hit the nail on the head re: admitting we are powerless. 

Anyway, I thought you might enjoy. I apologize in advance for the wall of text; I transcribed it as it is written (no paragraph breaks.)

“In his study of the form that masochism takes in modern man, Theodor Reik puts forth an interesting view. Masochism is more widespread than we realize because it takes an attenuated form. The basic dynamism is as follows: a human being sees something bad which is coming as inevitable. There is no way he can halt the process; he is helpless. This sense of helplessness generates a need to gain some control over the impending pain—any kind of control will do. This makes sense; the subjective feeling of helplessness is more painful than the impending misery. So the person seizes control over the situation in the only way open to him: he connives to bring on the impending misery; he hastens it. This activity on his part promotes the false impression that he enjoys pain. Not so. It is simply that he cannot any longer endure the helplessness or the supposed helplessness. But in the process of gaining control over the inevitable misery he becomes, automatically, anhedonic (which means being unable or unwilling to enjoy pleasure). Anhedonia sets in stealthily. Over the years it takes control of him. For example, he learns to defer gratification; this is a step in the dismal process of anhedonia. In learning to defer gratification he experiences a sense of self-mastery; he has become stoic, disciplined; he does not give way to impulse. He has *control*. Control over himself in terms of his impulses and control over the external situation. He is a controlled and controlling person. Pretty soon he has branched out and is controlling other people, as part of the situation. He becomes a manipulator. Of course, he is not consciously aware of this; all he intends to do is lessen his own sense of impotence. But in his task of lessening this sense, he insidiously overpowers the freedom of others. Yet, he derives no pleasure from this, no positive psychological gain; all his gains are essentially negative. 

(Continued on a different page)
“In summary [...] the modern-day masochist does not enjoy pain, he simply can’t stand being helpless.”

alcoholism,veggiebum,2020/01/07,"Embarrassed to go to an event. Last Spring I went with my boyfriend to a work event of his (his boss' birthday party). I got too drunk and made a huge idiot of myself. I fell, and apparently I said something not very nice to his manager, causing us to abruptly leave. I don't remember what happened and when I asked my boyfriend to apologize to his coworkers for me and try to find out what happened, the consensus was that a lot of people at that party were really drunk and no one remembers what happened, remembers seeing me fall, and his boss ""doesn't remember"" me being rude to him. My paranoid self if telling me that everyone is just being polite and not mentioning what happened, especially his boss. He was apparently pretty drunk too. All of this is supposed to make me feel slightly better about what happened, but it didn't. 

After that event I decided to stop drinking entirely. I have always had a problem with alcohol. It wasn't so much that I couldn't say no to a drink... I could go months without drinking. But when I start drinking, I just can't seem to stop, and always needed to be the drunkest person there. It does not help that I just wasn't a good drunk. I get angry quickly and just.. wasn't a good drunk. I have done so many things in my years of drinking (I am 27) that led to just awful decisions, awful outcomes and permanent, long-lasting negative things. 

It has been almost 8 months of no drinking and I have never been happier in my entire life. I love waking up after a party knowing exactly what happening, waking up without crippling anxiety about what I said or did. There have been times when it's been a little difficult and people press as to why I'm not having a drink. But I've learned how to react and respond in these situations. 

This started as a year of no drinking, but now that I have started this life, with how happy I am, I know I'm going to continue it. It would be nice to one day have control over how much I drink and be able to have one drink on a night out. But I don't see that happening right now because I am just so happy. My boyfriend (now fiance) and I are the absolute best we have ever been and everything else in my life is just falling into pieces. I honestly never realized how much those nights of drinking were adding to my overall anxiety. I would always lie to myself and say that I didn't have a problem, even after a night out that went horrible wrong that was meant to be just a night out with friends to get some drinks. I didn't know that this affected all of the aspects of my life. My career is booming, my mental and physical health are booming and all the relationships in my life seem.. clearer and better somehow. 

However, this upcoming weekend, I have a another work event for my fiance, a wedding of his coworker. All the same people will be there that were there last spring when I made a total ass of myself. I am so nervous. I keep telling myself that I have almost 8 months of evidence that I am not that person who they saw that night, and that I am working towards bettering my life. But no matter what, I think myself back into being nervous to see all of them. I'm nervous to see his boss, nervous to see his female coworkers that must have judged me for being such an ass. I wish I could cancel or play sick but I know I have to go. I don't know if I apologize or just leave it alone and have a good time... I'm just so nervous. And I'm also nervous for them to see that I'm not drinking at all and to judge that I can't drink otherwise I'll turn into the person they saw last time. I've come up with a hundred excuses why I can't go and feel like I'm being such a quitter.",4.831842813721231,5.330636840816329,5.776691272253583,81.50008684324794,69.02721088435375,8.867564046895351,30.332175423360834,8.902300299844763,2.3643764654798094,2878,108,572,48,47,951,267,735,0.182,0.7390000000000001,0.079,-0.9973,3,1,16,0,0,0,79.0,2,0,4,8,42,29,2,7,30,2,72,33,4,16,12,136,130,53,0,12,30,0,3,1,1,4,9,6,0,4,48,39,20,4,20,21,0,12,30,13,0,3,30,17,87,16,82,83,15,81,0,0,8,3,39,23,2,12,47,428,135,10,0.0448969992367317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04798123813471295,0.08991571875496754,0.046499750982735816,0.0,0.03590411406877528,0.11207369996574364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04707841834119094,0.06869216305521765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041972633636949384,0.0,0.0,0.034523021086674745,0.0,0.027368794015830845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047116630774218085,0.11912324192683832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04612158566375154,0.0,0.03867478939044668,0.0,0.0,0.050355802313328216,0.07169320117690517,0.0,0.0,0.02895485027161644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03928966658760266,0.04594521812436725,0.0,0.6157475350022177,0.0,0.0,0.03750568180517832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02965404456217685,0.040611906211339116,0.0,0.04290100678933054,0.040350527938751685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04540254363595735,0.03207442522556575,0.0,0.0,0.041035043924651515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03468731023847694,0.0,0.04691365809177106,0.0,0.12757999658994024,0.11297241850820874,0.035908231708549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.277915877052974,0.09558738108761873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04772341071031108,0.0,0.0,0.03009351220025477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03990651581411317,0.0,0.0,0.12337108311270635,0.14638818680240093,0.0,0.0950788791535423,0.0,0.0,0.19027246993748306,0.021934405992038237,0.04499858810011238,0.0,0.039732431498334886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03816982321918305,0.04052129470703302,0.0849652524836444,0.029969095621431043,0.045518510363369055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04524561534370738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10750906934520384,0.0,0.09901338106181916,0.03329055604622489,0.06925466724715001,0.0,0.0,0.2106639618876735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09127010587884718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09337777863403933,0.1176069839265726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04567638898633895,0.0,0.08592072959472276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02876216736441993,0.0,0.0,0.04820257494733498,0.20343819195312496,0.03834179203513277,0.08541465516701108,0.0714077916532958,0.0,0.0,0.2146625733455311,0.08174508378351192,0.04683736187560973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05046610825261378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03456390348136037,0.0,0.0,0.09533498143003673,0.0,0.0,0.07507180343290956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07848391249649846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0596551426322429,0.028768184249524594,0.0,0.0,0.07853940392112592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0304821153653096,0.04883504267168495,0.0,0.0,0.05400556206007686,0.0,0.0,0.03704472636444018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08323993619247555,0.08102511705928067,0.0,0.05162933338776467,0.08655821022211074,0.0,0.09805665049506247,0.0,0.0,0.06378708019987192,0.04908782061634938,0.0,0.05782439100502761
alcoholism,dedcrush,2020/01/07,"Will I be taken seriously? I'm an 18 year old girl in my first year of university. I've only been drinking for a little over a year but I already feel I have a very destructive relationship with alcohol - I'm drinking at least 70 units of alcohol a week. A lot of that is alone in my dorm. I've arranged to go to our Universities student wellbeing service next week to talk about this but I'm afraid to go for a couple reasons. One, it's seen as normal in the UK to drink a lot in your first year of uni (especially in the north aha) Two, idk I feel like I don't really come across like the type of person who would be an alcoholic?? I'm a very meak and shy girl idk idk 

Does anyone has any tips to express to a counsellor that you think you really do have a problem?

alcoholism,weiner693333,2020/01/07,Not eating and alcoholism Does anyone else have trouble eating? I will feel hungry but the thought of eating makes my stomach upset. But I can keep drinking somewhat fine. Then in the mornings I wake up and puke for like 3 hours bc I didn’t eat the day before. Does this happen to anyone else? It sucks because I have to force myself to eat and it’s hard. And don’t care about stopping none of those comments just wanna see if others have this trouble,1.6671399387129746,4.326008134831461,2.4148927477017392,92.15980592441272,85.62921348314606,3.685801838610828,20.450459652706847,4.851557810540192,-0.16343595505617925,360,11,67,1,11,112,64,89,0.205,0.701,0.09300000000000001,-0.8807,0,0,2,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,0,2,7,1,1,3,0,7,9,2,1,0,16,15,8,0,2,5,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,4,7,2,2,1,0,0,4,4,0,0,2,3,7,3,10,12,2,6,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,2,5,45,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525355078412283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.199600982183784,0.2924885487737137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08700719398873646,0.0,0.12145315122894758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14552326721646205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09204937101138363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2498088619149955,0.0,0.0,0.13982156151751132,0.0,0.7302447211085931,0.2384660522941137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07216883431967855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12621611842884786,0.0,0.12785850163886298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14056080126726975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268654351684161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06973091748482138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095273723602603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373773691789635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193290972301025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11331208161728193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,nofeeela,2020/01/07,"Need an alternative 18 year old here who has decided that he has a binge drinking problem. Been going out every weekend for a while now with going to uni, drinking seems inevitable. Now I've realised my behaviour while drunk is getting worse. I'm getting aggressive drunk and causing more and more problems most recently causing a scene at the local metro station. My most recent one is the reason why I now I think I have a problem. Originally just going out for a few drinks at 4 o clock in the afternoon ended up with me sleeping rough at 4 in the morning. Lost my wallet and contact with my friend who I was supposed to be staying with that night. I can't drink in moderation anymore, I always drink to the extreme. I want to stop drinking but I feel like I need an escape from regular life. 

I need to find an alternative activity to escape from normality has anyone got any suggestions.",5.407627450980391,6.771468958823532,6.316176470588236,75.01112745098041,68.23529411764707,8.725490196078429,34.166666666666664,9.075114841892004,3.2014313725490204,713,34,123,13,12,236,105,170,0.098,0.836,0.066,-0.3023,0,0,6,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,5,7,1,0,13,0,10,10,1,4,0,31,25,6,0,8,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,9,8,1,6,9,0,3,1,5,0,1,4,2,15,2,23,20,5,30,0,1,0,0,6,10,0,3,17,82,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09309125442969128,0.0,0.0,0.0760807097941544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11095267042653914,0.07822752752421186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2298585448880933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6575856450657096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09909048377808027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426183376422173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05656875443563422,0.07992549046578908,0.0,0.0,0.10225424115624568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643647592286215,0.0,0.11690301871849047,0.0,0.1907481190268746,0.0,0.08947886083325303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07902256691503035,0.054657819887978236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12212778544136856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24886781301563596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049896941811316,0.10961644592054864,0.0,0.0,0.1173968839196444,0.0,0.07581126214972507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3211557060995873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150289652667926,0.2209315718920608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10184930624035787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11195855169199953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11924680093085395,0.0,0.09353481266351782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07168674792403501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598839850177747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10095227233953892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11401299024278505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07204560610923423

alcoholism,el_muerte28,2020/01/07,"Are there any alcoholics in here that don't like to get drunk? Do I have a problem? I like beer.  No, I *love* beer.  I also enjoy the occasional glass of red wine or scotch on the rocks.  But I rarely get drunk because I hate it.  I'll get tipsy from time to time, but that's about as far as I like to take it.

When I get home from work, the first thing I do is crack a beer.   I might have one or two more later throughout the evening.  I used to be worse, drinking until I had a buzz, but I've since cut way back.  On the weekends, I'll have 5-10 drinks, but I make sure to not cross that threshold of getting drunk.

On Saturdays, or vacation, I like to have a beer or two in the middle of the day but, again, I don't get drunk.

I find beer relaxes me.  Helps me destress from work and traffic, helps me to loosen up a little, plus I like trying all sorts of different beers (though, I usually drink cheap beer).

I'm in my mind twenties and over the past 3 years there has probably been only 15 of so days where I *haven't* had a drink.

alcoholism,bsbhnxtx,2020/01/08,"Any resources to find the best doctor to help with detox? I had a pretty scary experience early last year. I was in the hospital for almost a month with horrible DTs. Not a fun experience. I was on a two week bender about an hour after discharging. After that two weeks I finally went to rehab, where they just detoxed me with Ativan for almost a week and I was completely fine. A little sweaty, still a tiny bit of tremors but absolutely nothing like the hospital experience. I’m still rather confused to if they just loaded me on so much medicine that made me have this experience.

I’ve been on a bad tear since about October. I’m putting down a handle of whiskey at home about every two days, and that’s not including the nightly trips to the bar which I can’t even keep track of how much I’m putting down. I get a few sporadic hours of sleep here and there and just slowly sipping at home on jack and cokes just to zero out, and it starts to pick up at the bar even though I’m really not even getting drunk anymore...I just want to sleep.

I’m absolutely terrified to go to the hospital and detox because I do NOT want to lose another month of my life that I didn’t even realize I did. Does anyone know if there are any resources online to maybe narrow down a doctor a can speak with first in my area that specializes or maybe just knows a bit more about the subject and can just give me a check up and see what my best options are if doing this at home?",6.2450510204081615,5.668419040816327,6.546998299319732,80.85172193877553,66.07482993197279,10.07108843537415,30.96003401360545,9.516144504307137,2.4653952380952373,1154,37,241,20,16,373,155,294,0.08,0.843,0.077,-0.6012,0,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,2,4,25,9,0,1,23,0,15,14,2,3,0,45,33,17,0,6,17,0,0,1,0,0,7,1,3,0,10,14,5,1,4,4,1,5,6,3,0,5,9,2,19,6,45,24,8,44,0,1,1,0,5,20,0,8,20,162,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18706715054880144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12703986824768873,0.09794533918402866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0653123164656772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0779909078555907,0.05694001428660899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19604967817500774,0.0,0.2039524106807397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09793541773964333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060239760187417016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.191211957873856,0.08174105791874384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467776578024467,0.0,0.07869939025668997,0.0,0.0,0.3654797110854919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10232275618529564,0.0853722668952738,0.07945191028598975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760256007032687,0.08960446491569901,0.05308532648033227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06260871464141236,0.0,0.2810843827662249,0.0,0.1839740753697136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830243955678151,0.0,0.0,0.10266804201790722,0.07613913717844221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0659760964155132,0.04563392124009976,0.09361831024836442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10449849280687803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838392162047158,0.0,0.0,0.18767968700436466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14911308455693642,0.0,0.13732972252910552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08765610200156737,0.0,0.08962649486832051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09502845612921296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18779958281453524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0598388887612881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07443325164434074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07726720043960128,0.0,0.18694882966570972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06611392524274147,0.0,0.14918983374897446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09177186143696198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737350745868493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11018768718408964,0.0,0.2247762811253585,0.0,0.0,0.08658918535603756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06015101812736527

There’s a LOT more too it, but this was definitely a low. I have no friends outside the bar. I do nothing but go and “hang out” just to not be alone.

alcoholism,pilothelpthrowaway,2020/01/08,"Advice for Pilot with Alcohol Use Disorder Friend of mine is a pilot with an alcohol use disorder. Doesn’t drink on the job (according to him, of course, but I think he’s being truthful), but he tends to go overboard when he’s off the clock. A series of events in his personal life leads him to recognize his relationship with alcohol isn’t healthy, so he seeks help. The therapist he goes to warns him that therapists are legally required to report substance abuse because of his profession, so he decides to deal with it on his own.

Question:
Is there any way for pilots to seek professional help without losing their job, or is he pretty much stuck with off-the-books, AA-type organizations for support? Disclaimer: I recognize the dangers of an impaired pilot, and my intention is not to enable him. But this is also a good friend of mine, and I want to try and help him find a way to keep his job and get healthy. I appreciate any insight you all might have.

alcoholism,The_Light_Guy,2020/01/08,"I believe I have found myself in the clutches of the hootch and I am struggling to cut back. My introduction to drinking was a culture of work all day and then go out and party and get hammered at night. And then get up and do it again. Summer camp employee. This was back when I was about 17-18. It was just during the summer and was no big deal. But now, I am soon to be 25 and drink about a pint of vodka a night. I am what I think is called a high functioning alcoholic. I travel all over the country each week and usually work 50-60 hours a week. Yet I somehow manage to get plastered pretty much every night. Any tips on ways to cut back? It is starting to stunt my ability to grow but I struggle to not just swing into a liquor store before my hotel. I want to do something about this before it messes something up.

alcoholism,ComputerLamp,2020/01/08,Urges month into sobriety So after celebrating my one month yesterday I didn’t expect this coming. I got home from work about an hour ago and was looking for something to eat before bed. While digging thru the freezer I found one of the last supreme pizzas that I hadn’t ate from about a month ago. Backstory behind this is that I used to always come home from work and make one of those pizzas then binge drink until I found myself sloppy drunk. Not sure why but just seeing that pizza almost made me go pour one while preheating the oven. I’m trying to stay sober for real this time and it was incredibly hard to not drink even a month out.,6.783809523809524,6.5415170634920665,6.507777777777778,80.465,64.87301587301587,9.104761904761906,26.73015873015873,8.418075326091056,1.6190444444444445,514,11,99,6,7,161,87,126,0.044000000000000004,0.917,0.04,0.1453,0,0,3,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,0,6,0,5,8,0,3,1,20,18,9,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,8,7,8,0,2,3,0,3,4,0,0,4,9,3,9,2,19,9,0,21,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,1,15,63,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2397085588562747,0.0,0.13539189736279372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11250439925252924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11505257302151035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329404997561557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.264905937041523,0.0,0.13835216830321992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0893040152121822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2964985356528965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768421719495913,0.0,0.10813868118458853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12112036161578033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.271250530732748,0.0,0.13315325035312955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11021306750985163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11354118367853867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12793766098915715,0.09025280061409452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4316889070166395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3664834277712983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538970051260505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10774376086281973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10409019774081084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14411439381391264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12743251977682246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0788412308909122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09179777445115136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11677683177226422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12200474493890885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968669645070021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,aSpunkBeetle,2020/01/09,"Alcohol withdrawals/DTs UK I have been tapering off alcohol for 6 months now, with a couple of increases where I have got drunk. I'm down from 37 units to about 10 now and I have been in hospital twice from hallucinations, seizures ect. Then again for surgery where I needed benzos to stabilise me. 

All the hospital does is stabilises me and sends me on my way. Its financially impossible to afford alcohol to stop these bad withdrawals, which the Drs say I need to continue drinking.

 The other day I slashed my wrists and went to a bridge over a dual carigeway hoping to jump off as I'm so sick of this cycle. A family member got me before I did.

I want to stop but the hallucinations, jumpiness being so confused and the seizures are too much. I have woke up on the floor drool all over my mouth and have banged my head twice now. I can't keep food or water down. I have no money. 

I don't know what to do. Im in debt. I'm behind on bills. Is the bridge my only option. I want a inpatient detox but can't get one. I really want this to end. These withdrawals are too painful. 

My partner is fed up, and she doesnt understand these withdrawals, she keeps saying I'll be fine. I'm at my wits end and can't cope. The alcohol services are literally useless I've tried to get help. I might end up being forced to just end my life, I have exhausted all the help from the mental health team and gp and got nowhere. I've basically ruined my life at 25. I don't know what else to do.",1.7506000000000022,3.9366928600000013,3.3353333333333346,88.96100000000001,80.4,6.8000000000000025,22.333333333333336,7.908726449838941,1.0588333333333335,1158,37,247,21,30,382,157,300,0.122,0.815,0.063,-0.955,2,0,5,0,0,1,32.0,0,0,0,1,12,8,0,1,15,0,28,21,4,0,3,33,51,16,0,6,4,0,0,0,1,1,12,2,0,1,10,10,9,4,3,3,3,4,7,6,0,3,9,3,32,2,40,38,5,38,0,2,0,0,9,19,0,5,14,157,42,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4852829036082837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09478630955620082,0.0,0.0,0.09659904555159124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256101741317288,0.0,0.07321243865103311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09934405730580287,0.0,0.0,0.11120855452044852,0.0,0.0,0.0948332456382443,0.0,0.4021879571263857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701864318057144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13727151568158202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1186213460860555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27238226269879395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165065460327065,0.12066880837134622,0.0,0.0,0.15218309851976805,0.0,0.0,0.11275317644723228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1226234751126438,0.0,0.0,0.2018075253997256,0.0,0.0,0.12477768344814558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1603681985528343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11440369425175732,0.1204291327078686,0.0,0.0,0.0906123507233962,0.0,0.08345189169366654,0.16835057127421674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692559236933398,0.08633876170618983,0.1207956430382044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272523925646206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18055484717002532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18981931357600754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707413370132606,0.0,0.0,0.11818063170662968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2008750349345547,0.09010865200847062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523623269745387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,icantsleepxoxo,2020/01/09,"Help?? Before I start, I just want to say that I’m really sorry if I offend anybody. I am just at my wits end and I need help.


My mum has had an alcohol problem for a long time, probably longer than I remember, or maybe I just didn’t understand what alcoholism is and was blind and to young to acknowledge it.
I think the time it got worse was when my grandad (mums dad) died, however this was 6/7 years ago. I guess because I’m older now, I can really see the damage that it’s causing to my mum and my family.

My mum lives in a bubble, where nothing bad happens in her world. Like, she won’t even acknowledge the stuff that’s happening in Iran/America or the fires in Australia. To put it into perspective, she didn’t even know who Trump was until I told her. (We are in the U.K.) Because she literally refuses to accept anything that could slightly tilter her ideal perfect happy world. Except her perfect happy world isn’t that at all, she struggles so bad with mental health problems but just won’t admit it and all of these problems and burying her head under the sand to life, have resorted to her drinking. Yet, she refuses to admit or accept any of it.

We have tried and tried to explain how we feel, we have tried interventions, we have tried to be supportive. She told me that in the new year she was going to “quit” for 3 days a week. I told her that I want her to go and get help, not just “quit. Anyway, she lasted 2 days before she had to have a drink. Yet she continues to tell me that she “doesn’t have a problem because if she was an alcoholic then she couldn’t get up to go to work”. 

I am at my wits end. I can’t take this anymore because it’s destroying me. I am receiving therapy for anxiety/Ed because of all of this.

I just needed to outlet everything.

I am an introvert with massive anxiety (since childhood) and I am working from home this week with so many meetings. I can't stop thinking about getting some beer to help me calm my nerves from having to talk to people. I don't want to get drunk but I really just want a drink. I promised myself I would get through this but today is really hard. I keep thinking about how everyone always compliments me after meetings after I've had a drink vs being sober and awkward. I like not overthinking and alcohol seems to help. I know I shouldn't. Just really struggling today.

alcoholism,WiseBullfrog0,2020/01/10,"2 days sober and I am freaking out So I've been drinking off and on for years.  I'm 63 years old and retired.  Up until the past year or so my pattern would be do whatever I had to do at home or with my job and then at 5:00 take a highball glass, filled to the brim with ice and add vodka.  I might head in the garage or yard and smoke a cigar.  This would be off and on over the years, and I'd drink until about 7 (maybe 4 or 5 in total).  There would be breaks in this habit, sometimes a month or more.

Last January my wife took a job in Germany (we live in the states) and was gone most of the year with the odd visit home.  By the time 5:00 rolled around I was bored out of my mind and for the past year, virtually without pause, would pour that first drink at 5 and continue with that habit.  Again, 4-6 ""drinks"" a night.  Most nights I went to bed not drunk but damn close.

I decided this needs to stop so a couple nights ago I dumped everything out and am determined to get my health back.  Last night (and this has happened in the past when I ""quit"" I had 3 or 4 terror dreams and I don't know if I was screaming or talking out loud but pretty sure I was.

Tonight, I am getting on a plane to fly 11 hours to the UK in business class and I'm freaking out that I'm going to have some hallucinatory dream and freak everyone else out.  I have access to my wife's prescription of lorazepam and was thinking of taking .05-1.0 mg to hopefully help me sleep and maybe calm things down.  Can anyone who may have had this experience help me out here?

Lastly, I have blood work scheduled with my dr when I get back and am pretty sure my liver enzymes are going to be crazy.

alcoholism,Funeraltourettes,2020/01/10,"One of those moments you realize what you've become I had one of those moments yesterday when I sat in the bathroom of the treatment facility I'm at, hunched over like a lunatic, squirting cheap ""Wonderwoman"" perfume I bought once at  dollarstore in a small glass because I felt like I had to drink but didn't have any other way to obtain alcohol.
It smelled. A lot. Like enough to give someone a migraine if they passed the bathroom. The smell followed me into my room and you absolutely didn't need to be Sherlock to figure out who it was. 
And today I am drinking hand sanitizer.

I don't want to. I really don't. I love being sober most of the time. It's like I can fight the urge most of the time, but then it hits me when I'm to tired or emotionally fragile to fight it and I give in. I am twenty years old. People say that I am bright. I am loved. I have a lot to live for.

alcoholism,I-Love-Grits,2020/01/10,"The Day After the Hangover 55-year old male.  Been drinking since I was 21.  Generally, I drink one day a week (either Friday or Saturday).  I work hard and work out in the mornings during the week, so there's no desire or even temptation to drink during the week.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I go out on Saturdays, I'll go pretty hard.  Have 7 or 8 vodka-on-the-rocks.  When I get a healthy buzz, I'll go home.  Don't want to TOO drunk in public.  But no doubt I have a very nice buzz.  Friends have always told me I'm a happy drunk.  The next day (hangover day) isn't TOO bad.  I have the usual headache (that Tylenol can cure), lethargy, and fatigue.  But as a rule, nothing debilitating. I can function, I don't throw up.  If I'm alone with no external stimuli, I will sit on the couch, eat, and watch TV all day.  If I have something to do, I can generally do it.  Granted, there have been some days where the  hangover is really bad, but those are few and far between.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that over the past year, I'm completely exhausted and fatigued the day AFTER the hangover.  It's not a hangover anymore (at least in the conventional sense).  No headache, no dizzy feeling.  It's just utter fatigue.  I want to sleep all day, have no energy to do ANYTHING.  The fatigue is only upstairs, I'm SLEEEEEPY.  Body feels fine. I figured it would go away, but it hasn't, and now I'm tired of being tired on Day Two.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else experience these symptoms on the day after the hagover?",2.247502463054189,4.436114789655175,3.4637684729064047,88.6762931034483,78.6896551724138,5.9359605911330044,26.219211822660107,7.021680442328713,1.1879901477832508,1139,46,230,13,28,369,153,290,0.177,0.7440000000000001,0.079,-0.9764,0,1,5,0,0,0,70.0,0,0,0,2,11,12,0,1,22,0,27,17,2,0,2,34,42,19,0,6,12,0,4,0,1,2,9,0,2,1,9,9,6,0,3,6,0,5,11,8,0,2,4,5,16,4,25,35,6,47,1,4,1,0,4,15,0,7,26,140,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08589342158658761,0.0,0.0,0.06900677499327099,0.26957312568581754,0.3023174714020745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08224710269437208,0.05798857715705511,0.08497450559888838,0.06824666939240245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07791814276205263,0.0,0.13849093164868512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211970071913002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695351558979257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5348482752692253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2437278610426652,0.0,0.08486100998149919,0.06927975464601192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054776365410476716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08112424107923387,0.0,0.0,0.08386668184684717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06407371435439377,0.0,0.043328991311605065,0.0,0.18853059986809276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828356118686456,0.1485830882464068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08318841069967878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656034899639023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08820002705923581,0.0,0.0,0.07957630649525789,0.0,0.08702407549650762,0.0,0.056197445626572036,0.06307416968794638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916878958043336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437252356928106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05312890746647954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06860291070453924,0.0,0.08299274333033532,0.0,0.0,0.06384575983008714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08619898579743504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19063822282035656,0.0,0.0792458923922655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08101334404827792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09133881785001144,0.0684282868603317,0.09783188754895716,0.0,0.19957119003677665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12075220536798298,0.0,0.0,0.0589131173349643,0.0,0.3023174714020745,0.10681207295984324

alcoholism,youngthrowaway13,2020/01/10,Today marks SIX WEEKS SOBER! I just wanted to post here because i’m so damn proud of myself. I turned 21 less than six months ago and my drinking pretty much spiraled out of control within a month of me being able to obtain alcohol by myself: and therefor easily conceal how much I was consuming. I simply wasn’t born with the ability to moderately consume alcohol and that was made abundantly clear once my 21st rolled around. Well NOW I have been completely free of alcohol for six weeks!!!!,7.992282608695652,7.836204097826091,7.875130434782608,71.37421739130438,62.36956521739131,11.273043478260867,34.70434782608696,10.793553405168565,3.827675652173912,395,15,67,9,5,127,70,92,0.035,0.758,0.207,0.9455,0,0,4,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,3,7,4,1,0,2,0,6,4,0,4,1,13,10,5,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,6,4,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,3,5,0,10,4,14,4,3,12,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,8,48,11,0,0.1794630750532126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15908318785234135,0.5753743470769355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15976018517877033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10939902483639836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18816361976540613,0.0,0.20128309872718814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17580549124591252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1698123008509714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28649142865973365,0.0,0.2638520189003633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1911223178905138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17187601772506092,0.18257846546921697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17011001108386553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1952042915386036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585197139432792,0.0,0.28790890752374865,0.0,0.16135885712171175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,apdunshiz,2020/01/10,"More than s delusion My mom has been in the hospital for a couple of days now. You ask her a question like ""what did you eat today"" and she will respond completely off the wall, for example found like,  ""roses are red"".  

She's never been this way before. 

A little back story. She does take clonazepam for anxiety and when she runs out, she used to use alcohol in replace of it, withdraw, go to detox,  get better, etc. She's been there 6 times,  out of 6 months,  about 18 months ago. This time it's different. She's seems to be in psychosis or something. She hasn't had alcohol for the last 2 days for sure. In fact, yesterday her blood alcohol was 0. Which we found a liter of vodka we think she had the night before. 

Has anyone experienced someone this way before? We are nervous it may be permanent.

alcoholism,UnfortunateLifstyle,2020/01/11,"An interesting title This may get long but I’ll try to use correct grammaaar.

I’ve been on reddit now browsing the threads on alcoholism for months now but I’ve never posted. But it’s gotten to the point where I need to reach out and gather opinions on my own personal situation. 

Writing this with shaky hands, recovering from a 4 day bender, I’m just sick of “bouncing back” from these benders. I’ll have a GREAT 4 months and then out of nowhere go walk down the street and buy a handle of fireball and finish it in 3 days. I’ve had 5 seizures, experienced DT’s an unhealthy amount of times, and hear and see things that aren’t really after every bender. The WORST is hearing sounds/music that isn’t even there. And it’s vivid, as if I can hear the chords and vocals of a song that I’ve never even heard before and it just plays through my head. That, and then the sudden jolts of explosions I hear in my ears/head that stir me awake as I’m trying to fall asleep.

This is somewhat of a venting session so forgive me if it gets annoying, but I’d just like to hear what some of you have done to SUSTAIN sobriety and not just stick to these month long strains of it. I attend AA, have a decent sponsor, have family support, and seek help from multiple counselors on a weekly basis, but nothing seems to stick right.

I’m not even sure if this is the right area to be posting such information or if I should go over to a different area (still new to Reddit). But feel free to lay it on me if you’d like because the youtube videos and advice from friends who have no idea what I’m going through, can only go so far.

alcoholism,Ohhshitfuck,2020/01/11,"I can’t enjoy shows sober I had issues with alcohol in the past, but I began to moderate. I’ve done pretty well with moderation mentally (or so I thought) , physically I’ve struggling with the kindling effect and feeling WDs after a night of heavier than usual drinking. 

I guess it still has some mental hold because I’ve realized I can’t enjoy shows as much sober. I know I used to be able to, I went to concerts long before I started drinking. And I always had a good time. 


I went to a sober venue last night for the first time, and I just didn’t have much fun. I drank a bit before hand, but was sober by time the show started. The music was good, but I just couldn’t jam like I usually do. I felt anxious and awkward without a drink in my hand, and resorted to chain smoking, which, I don’t even like smoking sober. I just needed something. I couldn’t hardly focus on the bands because my mind was either on how awkward I felt, how much I wanted a drink, OCD related obsessions, or how I felt guilty for being at a show instead of working (I’m an graphic designer and a workaholic and since I freelance i struggle to give myself time off”  


I feel guilty for not being able to enjoy the show sober, and I’m upset that I couldn’t enjoy it. I didn’t hate it or anything, I don’t regret going, but it’s the first time I was just having an “ok time”.  lm also upset that alcohol still clearly has a mental hold on me, I hate this. I don’t want to quit though, which I know is dumb rationally.  But I don’t go to shows super often at least...",3.6080840046029934,4.43065593037975,5.060552359033373,84.36413693901041,71.9746835443038,7.39102416570771,27.02186421173763,7.520522993642371,1.4291316455696204,1198,40,245,13,22,403,150,316,0.142,0.6629999999999999,0.196,0.9587,0,0,7,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,0,6,16,23,3,7,19,1,27,9,2,5,1,54,53,23,0,7,15,0,8,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,9,11,7,2,10,12,0,4,13,11,1,2,17,9,38,12,31,30,7,33,0,1,0,0,2,8,1,6,23,165,47,1,0.181796547059792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19428522094652606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07269131650121613,0.07563464528574472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10268917592388124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07480153408025793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11082148771310503,0.0,0.1546954715994992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923737224820688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302049302757563,0.0,0.3561828109005786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06003745238446132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09192179656848527,0.0,0.2618297920245561,0.0,0.0,0.15463605005824993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08719790671030637,0.10331916719715084,0.15248231839499926,0.0,0.0,0.10013469625515216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0814269988423117,0.17948645276615546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09487418145233786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991062787362052,0.07409422495782148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08881660999512361,0.0,0.0,0.08044211167210312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.274812240648101,0.0,0.0917813440801804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2004620698016216,0.06739991805457611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17060374417977509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08677268743832375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09247622269911876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096681502788694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519199118077048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997793185116058,0.0,0.0,0.12867653171061333,0.0,0.14518295731812314,0.0,0.0,0.19005322324909898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930709222738009,0.07216307574705594,0.3180210856790074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.078506923350286,0.2002232125636509,0.0,0.10722831364198343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08172846434717433,0.1685272204660939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08762269197036449,0.0,0.06617502572297702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,cam78sober,2020/01/11,"Starting an NHS Home Detox on Monday, anyone had previous experience of it? (UK) I've been off work for about 5 months after a nervous breakdown. 

Recognised alcohol was a huge part of that and that it was fighting against the antidepressants (Venlafaxine/Effexor) and asked for a detox. NHS has been amazing - referred from GP to Adult Mental Health Team in first place then referred to the local Addictions Team. Process took about 2 months (Christmas got in the way), and I had wanted to stop immediately, but get that they are busy.

5 day detox and I'll have a nurse round twice a day for the first 3 days, then once a day for the next 2. After that will be counselling and other stuff. All free of course, thanks to NHS.

I've been drinking constantly for about 25 years (41 years old), heavier over the last 10 years, and worse over the last two (lost my mum to cancer, lots of work pressure).

Probably average between 20 to 30 units a day. Can't remember last time I didn't have a drink.

Has anyone been through the same home detox and can give a bit of insight? It'll be librium for a few days and vitamin injections (pabrinex). Also been prescribed Thiamine in the meantime.

Just wondering how it's gone for others. I really want to stop, but it's a little scary :)",4.0438842975206635,6.002277396694218,4.293462809917358,85.83201239669422,72.55371900826447,7.649917355371901,27.802479338842968,8.395991825355821,1.9226241322314042,998,38,194,17,20,311,145,242,0.091,0.825,0.084,-0.3713,0,0,3,0,2,0,40.0,0,0,1,7,6,7,1,2,21,0,21,11,0,1,1,24,33,14,0,2,3,1,1,0,0,2,9,0,2,1,12,8,3,2,5,4,1,2,2,4,0,4,14,1,5,4,35,15,6,42,0,1,1,0,8,11,0,2,28,117,17,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12437031960192918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12192298322641705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09123434216258043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15954283397476704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10665478645045688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12455210348070665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12328617834934688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4414552680876743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22352122651121198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.111597765977075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1940825807089112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059605101608192226,0.10944145792896408,0.0,0.0,0.09124480531327388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126782946293135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288746413097472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27898536706072713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434390431399136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453808533286212,0.09699163458520453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497161421994966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18212433259379748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12133150150908305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11971381528420308,0.1214976125199577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12354376200508435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11919533873215915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1230037465985423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308626007694727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12923692796064326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08075048910542032,0.0,0.0,0.19076160988237634,0.0,0.0,0.1306009020080517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105034841179071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06652432491774643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12675347865974354,0.0,0.0,0.11144521156493464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13458147585159688,0.09055596713336413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12372114165069385,0.16611158608818538,0.0,0.11626313747191802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22040246965250407
alcoholism,throwaway99887788635,2020/01/11,"Am I an alcoholic? I am a 25 year old male. I honestly never thought I was an alcoholic or anything as I can go extended periods of time without drinking. I may occasionally have a beer when chilling alone but don’t feel the urge to have more after. I can even go periods of weeks without a drink. My issue is whenever I hang out with friends and have a drink I can’t stop. I plan on having one or two and end up having 15 drinks. Every time I drink socially I end up hammered. I keep my composure very well, and never seem shitfaced. Most people say I didn’t seem that drunk the next day even after 15 drinks in, knowing I was pretty fucked up. I can and have gone up to 3-4 weeks without one drink. But once I have one drink socially I get absolutely fucked, then start doing it more often. I was off work for holidays for 2.5 weeks, and would say I drank around 14 of the 18 days as I was hanging with a lot of friends, and every time was with friends I got absolutely shitfaced (probs had 150-200 drinks over those couple weeks). I came back home from the holidays and said I’m done binge drinking for a month as my body felt like it was shutting down. After getting home (different town then where I was for holidays), my buddy I hadn’t seen in a while invited me out tonight and I thought why not. I told him I’d have a couple drinks max as I need to work tomoro to catch up on stuff. I ended up drinking 15+ drinks, ended up at the casino to keep the night going, and am now at home awake past 6am. It’s almost like I lose control after the first couple drinks and can’t stop, and it only happens when with other people. I can control it when alone but when with others I can’t stop. When out with others, I always tell myself I will only have a couple drinks then have at least 10. It is especially an issue at work events as I work in finance and people drink often. Whenever we go out for a social event I try to limit myself to a few drinks as don’t want to do anything embarrassing around work colleagues and end up having like 10-15 drinks every time. Is this alcoholism? How can I stop this?

So after a lot of consumed alcohol, do your braincells really die and you can't get back your lost intelligence? Or are it just your synapses that get damaged and they can grow back if you use your brain often and think a lot?
I know it sounds like an odd question but I'm really curious.",5.309705449189984,6.795775876288662,6.1153166421207645,75.89989690721652,68.58762886597938,10.078939617083948,29.32106038291605,10.290406445055957,3.2146977908689247,408,15,72,11,7,134,67,97,0.145,0.74,0.115,-0.6553,1,0,3,0,0,0,7.0,0,9,1,1,10,4,0,0,5,0,4,6,4,3,1,21,14,10,1,1,7,0,1,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,5,3,2,0,4,0,0,1,2,2,0,0,1,2,12,2,4,13,3,5,0,2,0,0,14,0,0,6,6,49,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3408444691371456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12752608285401476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14908056342885265,0.0,0.0,0.24524129123681546,0.0,0.09720989317802607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5340553264567617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16550206330473535,0.16660957138137988,0.0,0.0,0.13955106278237553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343582262118928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063154727075568,0.11392359663784685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666303487487831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08763915431353349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15581550741155387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17407758758579447,0.27114709077898563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17864006884144368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30647684535677816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12276585381493815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12817391659854288,0.13938160274006045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10218031953488547,0.0,0.0,0.09298676759405028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13772869846998662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,MisfitToysCarClub,2020/01/11,"I can’t stop... please help Can’t stop. Drinking for PTSD, but I know the withdrawals make the anxiety worse. I’m terrified when I don’t have a drink. Not drinking excessively anymore, was drinking an entire fifth of Wild Turkey 101 EVERY morning. Kicked that. Drinking a half an airplane shot in the morning now, and a few beers in the evening. Body can’t handle it, mind can’t handle it, can’t stop. Huge weight gain because of it. Heart palpitations too. Single father of 4, full time. 2 special needs kids. Stress is at maximum. Now, I’m very very happy with my life, and my children. The problem is the drink. I can’t seem to kick it. Can’t find any other way to dull the anxiety. 
PTSD is from the marriage I got out of. Ex turned out to be a meth/heroin addict and a prostitute... yes, really. With her 15 years, and it was ALWAYS bad. Been divorced about 6 years now. 
I don’t know where to turn, and I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. No one understands, and while I’ve had people say they will help, they don’t want to or k ow how when it comes down to it. 
Can’t check in to rehab, there’s no on but me for the kids.

alcoholism,bighardsun_,2020/01/11,"Spouse Heading to Treatment So after 10 years of severe drinking, my husband will head to treatment on Monday. After a particularly rough binge over the Christmas holidays, it’s all came to a head that resulted in outside family members getting involved, and him being removed from our home. He has been a heavy drinking for many years, but the past few years have gotten quite bad. He hides alcohol, drinks first thing in the morning, into the night, gets belligerent, blacks out and can’t even put two words together most times. If he’s not at work, he’s drunk. So as of Monday, he heads out of province for a 5 week treatment program. I guess I’m looking for advice of how to deal with his absence? Maybe looking for others to share their experiences of their spouses heading away for treatment?

My husband is in detox at the hospital right now. I didn’t know how much he was drinking/ how bad it had gotten. Apparently he’s drinking a liter of vodka daily. We were supposed to be on our way to Morocco right now, but instead he is in the hospital because the alcohol did something to irritate his stomach and he was vomiting blood. They did some tests and his liver is angry but should recover.

I don’t really know why I’m writing all this. I feel stupid for not knowing how bad it is, I’m upset we had to cancel our vacation, I’m worried because it seems like he’s not feeling well at all (understatement of the year), and im worried about what happens when he gets home. 

I think I just needed to vent and I thought this group might understand.

alcoholism,Addict141891,2020/01/12,"Is there anything I should know about a serious caffeine binge? Recovering alcoholic here, almost a decade of sobriety. I also have over a year of sobriety to caffeine due to fairly serious medical complications with caffeine (it heightens my social anxiety and screws up my urinary system where I pee almost constantly). Of course I could drink one coffee in the morning and that’d be good for me, but I lack the ability to do anything that makes me feel good in moderation because that’s how I am.
 
I fell off the caffeine wagon last week, but in my way of justifying things this is a short-term addiction that I’m doing because I got a rare two weeks off work.
 
I am 100% capable of quitting caffeine intake again and this will not be a problem in the future.
 
My question is, since I’m pounding diet soda and some energy drinks like I used to with alcohol and will probably finish a 24 back of soda today, is there something I need to worry about? I’m not worried about long-term; I’ve got that one. I know what I can do. But I want to be positive me being me for a day with soda won’t hurt me.

alcoholism,esetting,2020/01/12,"Needing advice from those who have gotten sober I'm going to try and keep this brief, even though things always are complicated. My Aunt is an alcoholic and has been for 24 years. She is like a mother to me. Some very basic background is my family is VERY involved in one another's lives and I don't think their methods of support have been ideal, but as someone who has never faced addiction or rehab, I would like to know the thought's of those who have been through it and can see this situation more clearly. After 24 years, my aunt transitioned from a functioning alcoholic to a non-functioning alcoholic. She was content with her drinking problem until this happened, and was very self-aware about it. She called me and told me she intended to stop drinking, and on the first of the year (Jan 1st, 2020) would start attending AA daily. This was her own decision, as my family stopped trying to convince her to do anything a very long time ago. They even drank with her on holidays and at dinners. She attempted to quit New Year's Eve and decided to not go out. 

She was immediately sick, had horrible cravings, and called my (actual) mother. My aunt said she didn't think she could get through detox alone and that she felt horrible and wanted to go to rehab. They couldn't get her in anywhere that night but found one for the following day (new year day.) She called me and told me she wanted to go in for the Detox process, which she thought might last around 5-7 days. She did. On the 7th day, my mom and another aunt (lets call her P) visited her and she wanted to leave. P and my mom made the decision to rush out and leave her there without telling her they were leaving. Since then, my entire family has been trying to make decisions for my aunt. My grandfather, whom they are all very incredibly close with and see weekly, decided she should stay 28-90 days and should have no contact with her, and P agreed. 

They think isolating her and not seeing her will make it easier for her to want to stay in rehab. Meanwhile, I told my mom I disagreed and that my aunt would need support. Today, my mom visited again and my aunt has been there for two weeks exactly. My aunt had her bags packed and expressed to my mom that she wanted to go home, and that she never signed up to stay for 28 days, that she just wanted to come in on her own accord to detox. She explains that she wants to stay with my mom, go to AA meetings daily, and get on a new routine. My mom called me in a panic and asked what she should do when my aunt asked her to take her home (to my mom's house,) she's now concerned that visiting her did make her want to leave. I told my mom to talk to her, and try to see if my aunt thought staying in rehab would be in her best interest, and if my aunt didn't agree, then I thought it would be better to take her home. 

The reason I think this is because my aunt can check herself out on her own at any time, and has not. She can call a cab and do whatever she likes. What I don't want is for her to feel alone, and abandoned, and do something like leave and go to a bar, or even just feel she has nowhere to go at all. My mom went in and spoke to her, and my mom needed to rush to a job interview directly after and told my aunt she wouldn't have time to take her home today anyway and to stay for one more night. So my question now is what does anyone on this forum think about this situation? My mom is dependant on me for answers on this, and the rest of my family seems forceful about just this one option of rehab. If she left early she would not have support from them, and I do think they would make her feel worse, which would ruin the transparency my aunt has been trying to have with them. 

My aunt expects to hear from my mom tomorrow, and I truly don't know what to do. At this point, I think my mom should pick her up tomorrow morning and help her find local meetings, take her to them daily, and have my aunt get a counselor outside of rehab that can help her with short-term and long-term goals. I think my mom should establish a level of openness with my aunt so that if my aunt ever does feel overwhelmed by her triggers, she can tell my mom that she may need actual time in rehab outside of detoxing. I just don't think attempting to force her to stay there will result in her truly learning anything. But I could be wrong. PS my family lives on the East Coast and I live on the West Coast. That's why this has been something my mom has had to do on her own. If I was there I would absolutely be the one handling all of this. My aunt and I's connection is incredibly deep, and I'm the one she calls when she needs to vent, get advice, etc. If anyone has any advice at all on my current thoughts, please let me know. Thank you!",6.8544217066388615,5.557126693430661,6.7334704118873825,82.37199567692042,65.17309697601668,10.202302745915887,31.24089763642684,9.132015801924927,2.2745364789711515,3725,108,798,53,48,1181,317,959,0.063,0.855,0.083,0.9572,2,2,8,0,0,0,103.0,0,1,10,8,25,19,0,2,26,0,93,22,1,11,9,180,182,68,0,41,20,38,5,4,0,19,16,3,4,0,41,62,8,4,35,4,1,18,16,6,2,8,38,12,149,13,125,116,14,118,0,3,4,0,154,44,0,15,53,544,190,4,0.0,0.0,0.06101582651200675,0.03408098855314939,0.0,0.09164872923511573,0.027712522478197058,0.10023104730304697,0.0,0.06475751663938564,0.0,0.0,0.026013094468196638,0.0,0.0,0.04251945476956776,0.06556339323661171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043719253241725264,0.0,0.0514531235003364,0.027830456396165538,0.058452861869146965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01905746908771735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03280830474216985,0.027649342767731004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22345918784870866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02693007236110187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049921489578169616,0.0,0.0,0.12097124126221308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0547164486697408,0.0,0.0,0.06125114405508341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03486620614119941,0.0619462118691738,0.028278927700219163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.147358590314818,0.0,0.06322949935941692,0.0,0.030017121954237395,0.0,0.028573567423351782,0.026592060841674856,0.0,0.03427796810108903,0.0,0.0,0.08166742644547308,0.0,0.1421386321848167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027645527513975757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035235367059342916,0.0,0.04190949576846306,0.0,0.1254362625351438,0.0,0.0,0.0360729912070976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03102343405994635,0.027787749474312298,0.0,0.0,0.05154353388122207,0.025483296260515344,0.0,0.16551357718898368,0.03396704592508007,0.06393651589195518,0.0,0.06109355990021629,0.0,0.0828166859204536,0.05533306177987818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029581549552394424,0.08347245597477294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03316481446830636,0.0,0.6224470050355198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11590458505348812,0.048223486920150514,0.09058121381726032,0.0,0.05867590569388158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12710660326594708,0.0,0.0,0.036680075894836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034317087807492104,0.029553383383960345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02991420899471156,0.0,0.0,0.03502141066587521,0.0332517599027271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032143291637819094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029738013840540325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09964938787476994,0.028460413827076887,0.03261384391209779,0.0,0.0,0.0258608520268402,0.07028123325019572,0.0,0.0,0.026488808357002132,0.04813515142580715,0.0,0.0,0.022127920099196684,0.2332533621610131,0.0,0.052274081658633696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10642972126559123,0.0,0.0,0.09402272437346547,0.025127796910083933,0.054650005236620086,0.028782520068801495,0.0,0.0,0.020769567632021684,0.180287046464362,0.03071547196412443,0.12409557150905284,0.07291819344950974,0.0,0.05926682221509924,0.14936438380271813,0.0,0.10612670236156667,0.0,0.030539143035127607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1289751253096701,0.1659561050168665,0.0,0.05015415003394788,0.0,0.0,0.028980862473042913,0.02820974981200765,0.0,0.0,0.030136154604434768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03185939113138863,0.19987330781938964,0.034180885845331015,0.0,0.10066086063720746
alcoholism,Musician0527,2020/01/12,"Need Some Advice I probably know the answer already but I guess I wanted to talk about it.

I’m in my mid 30s, married, no kids, good job, good family. I’ve battled some addictions in the past but was able to pull through ultimately (pain meds in my late teens early twenties). I drank occasionally through the years but never anything major. A few years ago i fell in love with craft beer. It’s a fun hobby-beer releases, various kinds of beers for your palate, fun community etc. However the last year or so it has escalated. I used to only drink on the weekends and have a couple of beers. This has slowly inched its way into the work week. I’ve also noticed my anxiety has been substantially worse the last few months which in this fucked up way ends up increasing my drinking. Over the course of December with the holidays and a recent family trip I drank for almost a month straight with only a few days off. I haven’t drank in two days and am just feeling super fucking lethargic, down, depressed. I know that this is a hard come down-but also am I awaking to the reality that I’m an alcoholic?  Guess I’m just not sure how to approach this.  Ultimately I know it’s not good for me. But am I just in the place where I need to cut back substantially or just swear it off forever?",3.735,5.37968458498024,4.96800592885376,81.97548715415022,72.71541501976284,8.3801581027668,26.87924901185771,8.982922981607832,2.0938349407114627,1012,36,201,21,20,335,145,253,0.13,0.7290000000000001,0.141,0.7144,2,0,7,0,0,0,28.0,0,1,0,2,11,15,4,0,19,0,11,14,0,2,2,37,31,13,0,3,12,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,13,8,9,0,5,7,0,6,5,6,0,1,5,2,19,9,33,26,9,47,0,1,0,3,4,20,2,7,19,126,32,2,0.11308476495894312,0.0,0.0,0.12327908574347912,0.0,0.11050512352399336,0.10024282099182373,0.12085322246801625,0.11323805704592707,0.0,0.124791850163012,0.18086769136253308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08650953566697837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930591261147798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695520394746645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09741251180273007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12512614152046508,0.0,0.14586063625866028,0.0,0.09739974235440838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22156003568021615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10015953641710444,0.0,0.1261194055368309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2132125042338883,0.0,0.057179054980247175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20909008596183407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845504067316847,0.0,0.0,0.24915123578281675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10130173729170376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11221917995626553,0.0,0.0,0.11776038075225975,0.18644528819801232,0.18435835332811928,0.12756454049934396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10206341549944684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12561168073399978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18052636099727767,0.0,0.0,0.1677018406504049,0.08721794219096106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12874775442653227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720121190918969,0.12033016298506995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795220396118238,0.0,0.0,0.11814951051679175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12192450314693618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11165756274925966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658105267058277,0.0,0.0,0.09089325049923497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046738350586853,0.0,0.0,0.0976689284620675,0.0,0.0,0.06670032429801533,0.17952284552374032,0.09070977728219412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08232705572316093,0.0,0.11524303659491565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21846864301170565

alcoholism,Confusedgirl007,2020/01/12,"Is a ""functional alcoholic"" still bad as a ""alcoholic""? Er so I know a bit of what happen but not the full story...

Christmas eve, my grandma asked my sister about my moms bf (they been together for 3yrs, first time he came for Christmas). So my sister was honest.. she told her that hes a alcoholic. Which is true, that's the only thing he drinks (except at work, where he drinks water). He goes through two 24pks in a weekend. Every weekend he drinks so much to the point he is drunk (can't walk in a straight line, slurring his words, etc). 

Well... Christmas day he proposed to her. Everyone did agree that they had ""mixed feelings"" about this (my mom does not know about this). 

Fast forward to yesterday.. we went with my mom to a wedding expo and she was all happy (honestly, I started to feel bad that I also had ""mixed feelings""). So today my mom came in and yelled at my sister and I (even thought I wasn't part of this) :

Mom said ""you want to tell my mom that hes an alcoholic and be in my business"" 

Sister said ""well he is"" 

Mom said ""no hes not, hes a ""functional"" one and when you want to stop telling people about my business, especially your father (no idea why that's a problem, we never told her we talk to him about it and my dad is a good listener/ advice giver so we talk to him about problems) you can go look for an apartment and move out"" (her threat everytime).

So my mom probably told her mom where she went yesterday and my grandma probably brought what my sister said up.

Sooo I know the difference. But aren't they the same, in terms of a ""alcoholic""? Isn't just as bad? (I really hope that makes sense, I'm having a hard time putting into a question)

** I want to add that my sister, brother and I don't like him very much as he does have an attitude problem and threats to punch my brother (hes 12). Literally last night he said ""wait tell your 16 and I will punch you"". And other stuff to but isn't related to the topic (well it is but..) 
We just want are mom to make a good choice and honestly find someone better, I know it mean but..",1.5486355602686497,3.652255652173913,2.969787910922592,91.75554082714741,80.64251207729468,6.261246612466126,22.899493342759513,7.407850130929222,0.8632155767644631,1576,53,340,23,41,513,190,414,0.09699999999999999,0.8029999999999999,0.10099999999999999,0.20600000000000002,0,0,8,0,0,0,90.0,5,6,3,3,24,22,2,0,23,0,29,10,0,2,3,64,66,29,0,8,11,20,4,1,1,1,5,7,0,0,20,24,10,2,12,6,0,10,12,8,4,3,21,12,59,14,42,43,9,45,0,0,1,0,80,17,0,2,21,220,79,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05547942773518159,0.0,0.30337360878214586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04540258267028705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053076535043892516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14221311937954065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05021247081579334,0.06198309804178445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12986990783825858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03661488431784307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05931731508575892,0.0,0.0,0.09936757285890016,0.0,0.0,0.1668523177460081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06331862471485718,0.03749905114393305,0.0,0.04783500235008235,0.054250510224539486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08612074664720383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0518909050533607,0.048292398490670345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03226628197066269,0.0952395884392899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05020554214050983,0.06043755826635385,0.05085884015416855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0563899330244001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0640915500425619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12480721934913508,0.04627883130967995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02773717461652232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04767631828858033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07579489854000311,0.0,0.0,0.061844122914606565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6649366025948412,0.0,0.06034235573989255,0.08347164544082979,0.0,0.04378802870569208,0.0,0.0,0.05327906393642736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03847190064396208,0.04317959939958031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061481298981018076,0.0,0.03936032052741628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05367029564286596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12242512284997666,0.16297671435548858,0.0,0.0570740983886729,0.06360048322886347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0363712269585114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2700279649739986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048104887256973386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040185314766029816,0.0,0.04534022452215847,0.047466061341065714,0.0,0.0,0.06499327018402776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912664564660329,0.1488703628190398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037718484570876405,0.0,0.0,0.045072646500948714,0.06621138685432029,0.0,0.05381562964841312,0.16275153067361847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055460480246219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046844945067795934,0.13394838913514992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15314140137946647,0.10526114297678882,0.05123019563450214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041332544528142785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Anon1396,2020/01/12,"Don’t know where to turn or what to do. My fiancé is an alcoholic- and somewhat in denial? Hello. I’m not sure what is the best subreddit to post this in and if it is triggering at all please let me know and I’ll delete it. I admire y’alls strength in finding sobriety and it gives me hope for my fiancé when I thought hope was useless. I (23f) have been with my fiancé (40m) for 3 years, engaged for 1. Our wedding is 1.5 months away and I am starting to panic. We have gone through so many ups and down with his awful binge weeks and somewhat normal sober weeks. I know you can’t make someone want to be sober but I really don’t know what his breaking point will be. He has had loved ones die from drunk drivers, a dui that he feared would cost him his job, countless relationships ended over alcohol, and I think he knows I’m hanging on by a thread, yet he continues to chose alcohol. I try not to take it personally because I know it’s an addiction and that makes his way of thinking totally warped, but it’s hard not to when he is completely emotionally abusive when he is drinking. From what I have heard from family he has had a problem with alcohol since college. Obviously with our age gap, he was my first “adult” relationship and because he is older I thought this is just how much adults drink until I realized it was everyday he was completely wasted even before I would come over, and when I was there he would always try to get me wasted as well. He is unable To have a single drink without getting carried away and unable to drink without becoming completely aggressive and argumentative with anyone he talks to. No matter how ridiculous it is, he will find something to argue about and try to blame everything on you. He has tried aa, counseling, antibuse(have they quit making this?), but of course he didn’t take it seriously because he wasn’t ready. The longest I have seen him sober was one month and when he relapsed, around his 5th binge, he was saying he needed to get help and complaining that he is going to have to go back to his sober app and start it all over, as if he believed he was technically sober during those binges? I’m afraid he will never be sober and our marriage will end if it even has a chance to begin. I don’t know what to do or say. What made you realize you need to quit drinking? I don’t think he will ever get there but somehow I still can’t help but hope...  I guess I am mostly ranting but I also would like any advice/insight on this.

alcoholism,yyfool,2020/01/12,"Crazy one year clean story Today marks a huge achievement &amp; accomplishment in my life!  
I never ever, in my life, found it so important until about 9 months ago. It made a big impact on my life.  
Some know &amp; some don't, that I am an alcoholic.  I have known that I have loved booze for a really long time.  
The term alcoholism or alcoholic was to me, a different world, something I was not. I have always payed my bills and that made everything ok. But I was fucken wrong.  Alcohol is destructive.  Alcohol is a fun little enemy.   It can be your friend, it can help you have fun in bad times and it can help you believe you are a people person. Believe me I used alcohol to get everything I could out of it!  Alcohol also changes who you are as a person.   It rearranges how you think and slowly I lost who I was and I hope to never be that person again! 
Now let’s think about that. In the beginning stages of the alcoholic mode, I lost Zachary Livingston the kid &amp; person I was before drinking and then slowly became a drunk ""Zack.""  It didn't happen over night, it was slowly &amp; progressively changing me and I had little to no idea it was happening except I knew in the back of my mind and it was like I was liking the crazy and I wanted to push it and see how crazy it could get and still be ok and I did!  I pushed hard for years and years and my life became unmanagable, probably like some crazy movie with stupid twists, lows,  ups &amp; downs.  In the process I was slowly loosing my abilities to feel and express true emotions and by the end, it was a world of FEAR that I lived in!   FEAR all the time!  Fear of loosing everything, fear of withdrawals, fear of feelings, fear of driving, fear of being in public, fear of going anywhere, fear of dying, and the small amounts of sober I had, hurt so bad.  I definitely felt depressed and confused.  I knew booze was bad, I knew I needed to stop, but there was no fucken way I was gonna do it.  All the ""Horrible stuff"" stopped completely within the first half of the first drink! I found it crazy.  I believed ""I"" was crazy!  I had come to terms that booze was going to kill me and there was nothing I could do to stop it!  I became comfortable with that and lived like that for a long time. By this time I had children and just to think about them and how I was teaching them to be people, when I knew in my mind, booze was going to take me out because I was unable to be sober &amp; feel!  It was completely crazy!  I tried and tried to be sober and failed and failed and tried and failed again but kept trying! I look at it like the world had the tools for me to use to find sobriety, I just needed to not only find the tools but use them in the right order like a kind of puzzle to freedom! 
Then by some miracle it happened!!!  I was trying to stop drinking so I put an interlock in my car so at least I would not drive drunk. But fuck that!  Drunk Zack was smart too.  He got that bitch to start and he was off, on his way home to sleep the drunk away!  He didn't make it.   The police woke him up.  He was sleeping in his car at a red light!  Yep I was busted with a 40oz in my lap half empty and many empty ones through out the car.  I was out of jail the next morning and I lost myself!!! 100% full fledge self destruction!  3 days later I was served divorce papers.  2 weeks after that, I was staying with someone that drank more then I did. 
 I was charged with a DUI &amp; I was assigned a caseworker and was put on U/As.  I hadn’t been in trouble, for over 10 years I think, and at that time they could only test for alcohol within 24 hrs!  Science had discovered a way to test for 5 fucken days now and..... Bam! Bam! Bam!!   Dirty!  Dirty! and Dirty!!  My caseworker told me to try to medically detox.  I tried but that was a joke.  Lol!   I was drunk the next day after detox.  My caseworker suggested that I try to get a red card.  I was shocked!  I didn’t really smoke pot because it super fucked me up when I was drinking.  Dirty after dirty U/As kept happening.  One day I went to court and didn’t have too  many dirty U/As but was told, people were concerned for the safety of the public, as during this time I was found sleeping drunk in my car by the police and told to get a cab out of there.  When I went to court, I was sent to jail that day!   Get this, they have an under ground tunnel to the jail from the courthouse!   It was crazy.  They released me the next morning.  I drove straight to the booze shop and got two 40s and immediately drank them to stop the shivers and sweating and not 5 minutes later my caseworker called and said I had till 5pm to go to this place where they were going to strap this thing to my ankle and it would sniff me every 20 minutes to see if I drank! Wow!   Science is crazy!  I went to get my red card that same day as maybe a back up plan.  I really didn’t know if I was going to even try to stop drinking.  I got to the place 10 minutes before they closed and strapped up my leg. That evening I went home to a super drunk friend.  It was one week till Christmas and I knew in my heart that I needed to be around for Christmas &amp; not in jail or missing or something. My kids needed me to be around for Christmas! 
That was ONE YEAR AGO! 
 I don’t know if you know but the first day without alcohol isnt that bad but by day 3,  Holy Fuck!!!  I tried to cover it with a lot of THC edibles.  It helped a lot, but rendered me very useless.  I was still staying with that drunk person.  On day one, we were on the same level and every day that went by I felt different and they stayed the same, stuck where I was,  just a few days before. By the time Christmas hit I was a full fledged wreck.  Thats when I found out, I forgot how to feel feelings.  It was like getting hit by a train right after being beaten with a shovel! Shaking, sweating, cold, confused full of anxiety and super scared!  But a real scared!  A different fear from the fear I had when I was drinking! I realized that this scared feeling I felt was REAL &amp; was not caused by alcohol. I sat there that night and thought, maybe I could make it till New Years, not drinking and then I will drink and go back to my path of destruction. A few days later, the person I was staying with moved thousands of miles away and was still stuck right where I was on December 19th . I’m glad I saw them every day during my first part of detoxification to look at and see what I was and see the sickness of alcoholism in its pure raw form as my mind started to clear itself of alcohol.  New Years came and I spent alot of  time with my children, started to figure out where I was going to live &amp; kept working.  I smoked some pot to calm panic attacks. (I started getting panic attacks a few years ago every time I tryed to stop drinking.)  I made a commitment to get an apartment with a old friend and worked out my budget. Well look at that!   Sober me was making plans and goals now!!! And you know what?  They started to work out!  My divorce was finalized,  plans were made that worked out for everyone! 
I started to identify new feelings on a daily basis. I remember looking at a calendar and was so surprised I hadn't drank for 90 days!  Wow!  I looked on Facebook, of all places.  I looked at it and was... ok this is the moment!  This is it!  I’m going to be sober!  I’m really going to work for this and I knew I could do this!  
From that day forward, I have built a super strong support system.   I only keep the best people in my life! I also set lots of goals.  I have hour long goals,  day long goals,  week long goals, year long goals and even decade goals and I’m making them happen too!   Crazy right?  
I lost my drivers license and had to go to jail for 30 days.  6 months of not drinking only to get to go to jail &amp; then work release!  I had to put a breathelizer in my car &amp; got my drivers license back.   I started alcohol treatment/therapy &amp; I make sure I get my moneys worth, every time I go.  I make them follow their plans.  I lost my shit on them when they didn’t let me finish an activity and demanded a refund and now they make sure I get my time and make use of all the material they provide.  They don't skip anything.  Not with me!  Fuckers, I pay for treatment,  you provide it! 
That brings us to today.   December 19th 2019 my one year sobriety date!!  
Looking back on this last year, I feel I have grown more than any of my 20 years as an adult. I feel FREE!  I have newly found feelings &amp; understanding  for people that suffer from addiction and their potential to feel what I feel &amp; felt.  I have hope they look for the tools that work for them because I could never buy this feeling or be given it!   I’m so happy I found it &amp; I’m so excited to see what 2020 has to offer me &amp; other addicts that also want to be free.

alcoholism,thedogran,2020/01/12,"The drink has been negatively effecting my life for 28 years.. yet I don't stop. Most all of the problems in my life stem from alcohol abuse. Daily anxiety, dehydration, constipation, an unending hangover... I'm unable to be present in any moment, I'm dizzy most of the day, constantly feeling guilty for the previous night's debauchery, and always tired because I never get a good night's sleep.

Wife, job, respect have all been lost due to me not being sober. Why don't I stop?

It's tough writing all of this down. I'm just wondering if this page can be a safe place to get some support. It's taken me a few years to post this.

alcoholism,slappy813,2020/01/12,"Recently stopped/cut back on drinking. Having terrible anxiety. After about two years of heavy drinking I finally decided to quit. I have always had bad anxiety but now it is unbearable. I moved to nyc for a year and I started to drink a lot more. About a p in nt of vodka every night. The last month I was in NYC I was drinking a lot more, about 20 drinks a night, a few nights a week. I would black out frequently and sometimes wake up outside. One day I woke up after getting black out drunk and everything was terrifying to me. J didnt leave my house for several days, and when I tried going back to work I would have panic attacks on my way to work and at work. After several days of trying to get back to normal, I realized I couldn't. I stayed at home for 2 days and drank about 4 liters of vodka. I didnt want to be awake. It's been almost two months since then, and I moved back into my mother's house in Tampa, fl. I worked for a few weeks waiting for my to my anxiety to subside, but it hasn't. Sometimes I have good days, but for the most part I still feel a little terrified. I haven't had a panic attack since I left New York, but I just can't seem to calm down. I hate driving, being outside, being at work, or doing anything. Even laying in bed in my room isn't comforting most of the time.i only feel normal when I have a few drinks in me. I've cut back a lot, but the days I dont drink I feel like shit. I don't have health insurance or money to see a psychiatrist.  I did pay to get a blood test a month ago, and found my vitamin d to be very low and my liver enzymes very high. I've been taking vitamin d pills and other vitamins to help with anxiety but nothing is really helping. I started excersing yesterday as well but it did not really help. My future feels really bleak, and sometimes I think about killing myself. Reality just seems like a sick joke as of recently and I cant take it. 
Has anyone else felt like this when trying to quit drinking?",2.535143325143326,4.0194185995086045,4.325159705159706,86.02035217035217,75.53562653562653,7.783456183456185,24.126945126945127,8.484438967287268,1.484332350532351,1538,48,325,29,33,521,194,407,0.207,0.738,0.055,-0.9961,0,0,10,0,0,1,44.0,0,0,0,7,19,19,6,2,20,0,35,20,4,0,0,52,58,27,1,6,12,1,5,3,0,2,6,0,3,0,7,16,10,1,11,12,2,4,11,11,1,3,15,8,42,8,57,36,11,69,0,1,3,0,4,22,1,10,44,212,49,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055175930124806136,0.0,0.062328803810743724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051792350690429714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1904672692912324,0.0,0.0,0.043522751562438684,0.06377677255824032,0.0512218609690106,0.0,0.0,0.1416240463076272,0.0,0.23931061643731125,0.05197149772679903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24085504162409904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295000646239064,0.4878067447099588,0.0,0.0,0.051997232861890265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041111857888782334,0.0,0.05244361547116978,0.0,0.05594127866359167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12589061285296016,0.044467432055448265,0.05976441245281178,0.06818572878175183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06824780292930839,0.0,0.0,0.09756043431787936,0.0,0.03537494305884276,0.05220767333916508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06145348649898439,0.0,0.06616291666307103,0.0,0.0,0.1251633848148899,0.06576465601569807,0.062436236742803776,0.0,0.0,0.14364342645470024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06886423769800112,0.0,0.0,0.050737516764349226,0.0,0.06590786224437704,0.0676287535348976,0.0,0.0,0.0912284508235056,0.06238526941202751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15875396132254982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14904872660482735,0.13231195340547575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06011605677702081,0.0,0.17523653838020908,0.12197264809324165,0.0597252077503029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042178435553343774,0.047339692607056914,0.0,0.14606085073189096,0.0,0.06740465023564453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13240922275214434,0.0,0.0,0.1196261239960114,0.0,0.12291772755800262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04960075058742649,0.11332997967841607,0.0,0.14063697374312398,0.06389301123225248,0.10297846870659302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18468399369371316,0.0,0.08811385352316016,0.06634427874411371,0.04970848089051025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09360012741993723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0398837163714689,0.0,0.0,0.036295226731549037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12677964306897396,0.0,0.12160752407171604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10271634431724168,0.03671337654263921,0.04940672999033112,0.09985745180430028,0.0,0.05596521634850498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2265734258582295,0.0,0.0,0.08843331205019911,0.0,0.0,0.08016674219665255
alcoholism,throwaway39427349,2020/01/12,"Daughter of one alcoholic, maybe two I ask you to be brutally honest with me because I'm in a situation where I don't know what's right and wrong anymore.   


To give some context I'm 24F and have always known my father to be an aggressive alcoholic.  I was lucky to enough to have a mum that took me out of that situation when I was six and they got a divorce. I sadly at that age did witness them fighting regularly with one night resulting in my mum getting beaten up so badly that her face became unrecognisible and bizarrely my six year old mind used to blame myself for what was happening. Not long after the divorce my father got remarried and as my mum still wanted me to have a father figure in my life, I would occasionally visit them. My father's aggression would fluctuate depending on the day but his alcohol intake was always consistent. During those years I have witnessed a lot of things that I have only this summer been able to leave in the past with therapy.   
However this post isn't about my father, it's about my mum.   
She has always liked the occasional beer after work but it has now turned into 4-5 a night with the occasional sober day in between so nowhere near as much as my father (I don't know what else to compare it to) but definitely more than 'normal'?   
I've tried talking to her, she hasn't taken me seriously but eventually accepted that maybe she does drink too much and it's mainly because of boredom. She doesn't become aggressive, she becomes happier. So it's really difficult to distinguish if this is an actual problem.   
We spoke about the quantity of her drinking and she agreed that she needed to cut down but didn't and has continued to drink since these conversations. This is when I got very angry and said a lot of things which I shouldn't have said, calling her irresponsible and comparing her to my dad and a plethora of other things to which she replied I was making it all about myself.   


I realised I don't have the knowhow of dealing with yet again another parent with alcohol issues, I have no tolerance towards it which is very unfair on my mum. I'm not taking it very well at all, I've been in bed for the past three days only to have her come into my room this evening to tell me she was going to the shop and for me not to get mad at her for buying more beers. Even typing this out is making me realise just how problematic this is and I just can't believe I never saw this happening right under my own eyes.   


I have a thousand things going through my mind. What's going to happen to her health? Is it going to get worse when I leave home? Should I leave home? How do I help her? Have I made it worse? Am I the reason?   


Anyway, this is all a bit of a shitshow isn't it? Any advice would be appreciated and apologies if this is the wrong place to post this.   
I'd also liked to add that if you are someone dealing with alcohol issues, carry on fighting through them because it's absolutely worth getting your sobriety back.   
I don't understand why such a toxic substance is legal. Take my story as an example of many which could have panned out very differently had alcohol not been a part of it.

alcoholism,jaboyjapoko,2020/01/12,Why am i such a dick Within the past few months i havent been able to stop drinking until i pass out which in itself is a problem but the more immediate problem is how i act. I dont get aggressive or confrontational i just start being plain cold mean. Me and my girlfriend rn are on a break up phase because i brought up random shit as to why i dont like her but shes everything to me and i dont mean the things im saying. up until i blacked out was one of the greatest nights ive had with her laughing catching up and talking about the future that im pretty sure as of this morning wont happen. I just dont know why i cant continue acting as normal or even half pick up on when im drinking too much. I pick out any minor problem and act like its a big deal despite her giving me the world. Does anyone else have this or know someome who does can anyone give me advice or things they've tried to slow down or get your head straight again,3.1086916548797774,3.775965173267327,4.290608203677511,89.99990099009901,73.00990099009903,6.761527581329561,25.319660537482317,6.5431188927421005,0.7255759547383311,743,22,167,5,14,244,122,202,0.14,0.7559999999999999,0.10400000000000001,-0.6724,0,0,2,0,0,0,6.0,0,1,0,0,9,10,3,0,10,0,19,5,3,3,1,31,30,18,0,4,9,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,9,8,2,1,4,2,0,6,7,6,0,2,4,3,24,4,26,24,4,35,0,0,1,1,12,16,2,6,14,111,33,0,0.1058009211047683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10338743560973454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07194825441941913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14795692806079885,0.10840554664624193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06449525949682078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10907610395616024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1851741980772167,0.0,0.4959915662825779,0.20728924770266668,0.0,0.0,0.0883830935053618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06988051055744783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09508704580619072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11055322901052007,0.20298776841616933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09355940512003884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10858226861997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342849450967094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11629083861211248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10337797168167843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23049643937187836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08444928582616035,0.0,0.07777585062201196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09928699730587233,0.103662439020122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07169344228995074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10099895081826113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076375728812772,0.0,0.3037115783122817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08413713900054016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10860312511395467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748864365123074,0.0,0.0,0.08845430749522995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09971611603877424,0.0,0.0,0.08503877271635067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14057886153700738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07183188047527816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2864066250494567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,TrippinIrish,2020/01/12,"Question about Alcoholism I was in a very long term relationship, like about a decade long. Gradually over time, I realized my ex was a super control freak about a lot of insane things. In the last 3 years or so, he started controlling my drinking. I'm that person that quiet shy person sober but when drinking I just get happy. If I get behind I find a nice comfy spot and just go to sleep. I've never blacked out, I don't drink heavy when in public (bars and clubs, etc..). I'm super anxious about being too drunk when I do drink, plus I at some point filter in with ice water because I'm aware of the dehydration it causes and I start just craving water. 

So my ex suddenly started fighting with me while out drinking at friends houses. So much so, friends and family were literally sneaking me away to give me a shot or whatever. 

I feel like his control freak propelled me into a rebellion like a teenager does with their parents. Once I left, I was free to drink whenever I wanted. I don't think about it during sober days, I may have a few beers on occasion like every couple of weekends, when my kids aren't around. If it's offered and circumstance works out then I might have a few depending on where I am. 

For New year's I had a few beers with my dad, we (my kids and I) spent the week with him. I literally had 3 beers and then cooked dinner and finished off the night with lemonade that I made with my son. 

Now I have my ex telling me because I drink so much , ""I better get my shit straight, or else"". I'm pretty sure he's questioning our daughter when she goes to see him on the weekends. 

But am I just mentally warped because of him? I don't think I'm an alcoholic. Its not something I need.  I don't binge. I'm not ridiculous when I drink. Idk.. I'm at the point of just not drinking around the kids, ever, at all. To prevent them from having to report back, but it's frustrating that I'm being made to feel like I'm a problem when anyone else I drink with says  I'm fine not even annoying.",3.6981750402440063,4.700266503685505,4.7566669490807465,85.95658476658478,71.92383292383292,7.677675167330341,27.302296026433957,7.990435384864732,1.563555689231551,1565,54,327,21,29,513,198,407,0.08,0.758,0.162,0.9888,1,0,16,0,2,0,50.0,2,0,2,7,30,23,5,0,20,0,22,23,2,7,4,68,50,32,0,5,17,7,2,5,2,2,2,2,0,5,10,24,21,4,8,19,2,1,10,8,0,0,9,6,53,16,49,37,10,58,0,0,2,0,34,25,1,12,37,210,63,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15030206414865438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07944194124437147,0.0,0.04916960000478788,0.07205147385468517,0.0,0.12519998009885033,0.0,0.0,0.06606825172395124,0.05407198242161178,0.0,0.12859983590740226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06219260501856454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223833519685302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366106416941077,0.0,0.07780809218579066,0.0,0.04535078639196951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06153778244789376,0.0,0.0,0.6888713849644985,0.0,0.0,0.11748720149308953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842574072198866,0.046445905538511016,0.06360875177332839,0.0592478991550652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06629173561577589,0.0,0.07111212935902457,0.10047369566098094,0.0,0.0,0.06427149490170947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10865860347267646,0.0,0.11021838830253224,0.0674576548033372,0.03996465613852803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748572840268115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811402033251758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05732044310112741,0.0,0.0,0.076403229133222,0.0,0.0,0.17177477200681254,0.0,0.0,0.12446253369031522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05978381801992207,0.0,0.133077566624571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086633905467406,0.07459874269230654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10338704689908157,0.05214162331905405,0.054235362840940216,0.06791579942620718,0.0,0.06599085297580809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748888415770258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808238911540374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228019751722707,0.0,0.0,0.13295085638751236,0.0,0.0,0.07154104202384896,0.0,0.0672870454852971,0.0,0.0,0.15754969505298375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07549770278461371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055921537766772465,0.0,0.0,0.05603618748281992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0721827938861879,0.0,0.0,0.0703711005324458,0.0,0.0,0.054136014828313525,0.0,0.0,0.14931924489190634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06627606566206605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061463055713394735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046717693328038906,0.09011683821856473,0.0,0.0,0.04100434178462024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058021625273246474,0.04147674433765931,0.0,0.05640671587216752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05119402758890907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056795597680473
alcoholism,woodislife,2020/01/13,"Why do I keep passing my limits? Hi. 28 male here. 
So for the last 12 years I've been partying a lot like most of my friends. Usually I would be drinking every saturday. Three years ago I met my current girlfriend(26) and she wasn't much of a party goer compared to me. Since I've met her there's been these episodes were I go out and get really drunk and come home being all paranoid and delusional. I don't recall any of these situations. 

My girlfriend tells me that I'm saying things like ""I'm going to kill anyone who brakes in our house"", ""she should brake up with me for being a drunk"" ""I'm never going to give up partying"" etc.. There's also been episodes were I've shat on the floor only to find it the next morning, with a headic and no recollection of it all.

After previous episodes with this I've tried to stop drinking to much when I go out. It usually works for a couple of months and than I forget and it's the same all over again. I don't understand why I keep drinking and don't  realise that I've had enough.  Whats wrong with me?",2.5159722222222207,4.1369105046296335,3.785370370370373,89.29666666666668,75.89814814814815,6.837037037037038,23.574074074074076,7.594959193182576,0.9535296296296298,823,25,176,11,18,269,122,216,0.115,0.82,0.065,-0.8605,1,0,3,0,0,0,25.0,1,0,0,2,7,5,1,0,9,0,16,5,0,0,4,34,31,11,1,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,12,15,5,6,3,5,0,6,6,2,0,1,9,1,21,3,27,17,10,29,0,0,0,0,14,8,0,2,17,113,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180362526276327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10648615181922094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09055179131958292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310694875199006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11470355421439254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473364446919865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3913315101019115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13758748290720954,0.1485060163501031,0.0,0.0,0.1121910918485522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12170371085883452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287729637833304,0.0,0.06956939403080725,0.12773698399198208,0.3027063218426429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13356801410727764,0.0,0.0,0.15364608929069096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2367133356037017,0.14731924843938765,0.0,0.0,0.1085412848129403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13010823673624125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11320590120800593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10628519300329707,0.0,0.19577243817958748,0.0,0.10269941484342547,0.0,0.14161470761883144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10127241902839927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08530422209417672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10589233490767386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11014941225243996,0.14967481595059387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113257862648636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163856850145316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08846404847876231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09040532676405028,0.0,0.0,0.13862184514486364,0.0,0.0,0.2933087531910138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2403081969887196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09694037988237413,0.0,0.0,0.09459139826228942,0.14558702405564095,0.0,0.1714983655527752
alcoholism,HailToTheTheif90,2020/01/13,"Very little withdrawals... Anyone else? Long story short, I'm 29yo Male and had my first beer at 14... drank whenever I could in my teens and haven't gone more than a week with out a drink since 21... currently it's not hard for me to finish a 750 of jack per day and more on the weekends... I'm am so sick and tired I'm ready to end this prison...

Crazy thing is, I'm four days sober with out a single withdrawal besides a little cloudiness, mild hand shakes and hard time sleeping with odd dreams... and it's getting better every day... I actually slept through the night last night feeling decent when I work up

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it possible to not experience withdrawls till after the week make?

alcoholism,sipslurp,2020/01/13,"Anxiety battling my sobriety  

Hi friends.

I'd like to stop drinking, and I think I have what it takes to do so. My issue is that since I've been regularly drinking 4-6+ beers nightly, on days that I decide not to, I'm hit with panic and anxiety.

It only really happens at night, as that's when I would typically drink. Rarely if ever (maybe a weekend game or something) do I drink before the evening. My anxiety manifests itself via ""ooh I'm having a heart attack"" and I think I'm dying. I succumb and drink a few beers to make that go away, but it's always the urge to have that panic stop, more so than ""god I'd really like a beer right now"".

I need to learn how or what to replace alcohol in this equation. I think I'm mentally tough enough but a few reads on here have me concerned for my safety. I don't thiiiiiink I'd have serious withdrawals aside from extreme boredom, but is that possible with my usage?

If the responses (which I very much appreciate) are that I should see a doctor, can someone please outline what exactly that would entail? I just want to know that when the panic sets in, that I'm actually safe and can just hunker down and endure until it passes.

On that note, how long does that take to go away if anybody here has had similar experiences? I know there's a lot of questions in this post but I appreciate anybody taking the time to help me out. 25 y/o male if that is relevant.

Thanks :)",4.830877192982459,5.230998000000003,6.276929824561403,78.26100877192985,69.0,9.421052631578947,30.219298245614038,9.444778638647367,2.584719298245614,1110,41,222,22,18,379,162,285,0.10099999999999999,0.768,0.131,0.9287,0,0,10,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,0,0,14,12,2,3,12,0,20,11,1,3,2,44,42,24,1,9,13,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,1,24,9,9,3,8,11,0,3,2,7,0,0,2,1,22,5,29,36,6,30,0,0,1,0,6,12,0,8,15,144,46,4,0.0,0.0,0.09759707988854867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10688218767878108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321782082100825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295262361649287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11377784897251313,0.1879287372496548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510266683180187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0644993305977853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10379644789978752,0.0,0.0,0.10236630463654953,0.08752099114788725,0.0,0.0,0.4898673951775968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10333891361303027,0.0,0.06605684387365768,0.09046638958099433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09783072109992484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07726886064448525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136780097362181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884400953517076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11851445235126068,0.06703579448847752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10438632458462173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10992772818713062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772141732905852,0.0,0.0,0.08850728671103204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08502644716096018,0.0,0.0,0.06675864623959629,0.0,0.10047528526775197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10078836100957987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07352017294515316,0.07415747482950766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877085793277528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606347278274088,0.0,0.3520268594629515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10978291213120188,0.0,0.11274826585707112,0.09578364873563824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120360932550672,0.0,0.10003885432649463,0.0,0.12814022688040558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08540952196219041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07969644783345768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273078594625921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08473966487570465,0.0769939618572149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16722866886787988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2255892577365245,0.0,0.0,0.09207741896262933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19225054965250554,0.0,0.0,0.058317678856812986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08252020059750532,0.058989544790522576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14209101187140422,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,ObamaIsAMyth,2020/01/13,"Oh man I can't do this... I think I'm at full blown alcoholism now I've been drinking for a few years off and on. Usually binge drinking. 

I dunno. I've been getting blackout drunk where I act schizophrenic. I'm scared it's DT but it's only when I'm blackout drunk. The last thing I remember is Friday.  Fuck. I'm getting heart palpitations, I feel like I've caused at least a bit of brain damage. My memory is getting worse. I just can't handle how sad and depressed I am when I'm not drunk. 

The scary thing is that this weekend, even though I was close to being blackout drunk, I was acting totally normal. No word slurring or anything. I could carry a conversation like normal. It's like I need alcohol to even function now. When I'm sober I don't even want to leave my bed, whereas when I drink I want to go out and do hobbies and such.. 

I'm gonna end up killing myself from this.",0.2836956521739147,2.6141386739130468,2.2800000000000007,92.965,88.8913043478261,5.156521739130435,21.043478260869566,6.7026698264267655,0.4528173913043481,692,24,149,9,23,230,107,184,0.23,0.6829999999999999,0.087,-0.9785,0,0,5,0,0,1,24.0,0,0,0,0,14,9,2,1,5,0,15,13,2,2,1,24,33,12,1,6,4,0,1,3,0,1,3,0,1,1,9,6,9,0,3,8,0,3,5,6,0,0,4,1,18,3,13,26,5,23,0,3,0,1,2,9,1,2,14,86,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30571258949276564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11770205973619068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1561524540912298,0.0,0.0,0.15966953803183373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14693190435385012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11419835665391477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12319211206376675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4203468317973532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12668272560366164,0.0,0.0,0.2834112385736329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07232060761717278,0.1021811438532447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13222955563632996,0.2241828752555288,0.0,0.08128762958447193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1694920402897674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15824225176280096,0.0,0.0,0.1165890913779262,0.0,0.1514488343886139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2096326913027385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10605543427173947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2802793893165612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087812746690282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1620258742831424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14319865905560294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19004645190126004,0.0916482821601512,0.1405269134311361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15752808291640838,0.0,0.16872639756502975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14576047878146214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09210706620552972

alcoholism,SLCer,2020/01/13,"Blacking out I've been a weekend drinker consistently since around 2011. I've gotten prettAy wrecked many, many, many times over that stretch. For a good amount of time, I'd get drunk but generally remembered how things went the night before, even if it was spotty. A few years ago, I experienced my first blackout state. I remember texting a friend and then waking up hours later in my room with no recollection of what happened after that text. 

It was a one time thing, though, and I didn't really blackout again for a couple more years. The next time was in 2015.

After that, again, it proved another one off deal and stayed this way for a few more years. But now, this past year, it's becoming more and more frequent. This past Friday, I got drunk with some friends, and got into a fight. I don't really remember anything about it. The last memory I have is walking outside but apparently, we drank well after that. I took a Lyft home and don't remember that at all. In fact, the last few weeks, I've blacked out three of the four times I drank somewhat heavily. A few weeks ago, I even smacked my head out in a playground we were playing around in drunk and I don't recall any of it, nor taking my Lyft home. 

I don't think I'm drinking any more than I was a year ago but it's just becoming way more common to get blackout drunk. Is there a reason for this? Is my tolerance just not as high as it used to be? I'm scared I'm doing irreversible damage. It's just so odd that I never had this problem but now I'm having it almost every time I drink.",3.777107507339576,5.038910077170421,4.480905913602683,87.02040262826787,72.02250803858522,7.723808192366838,25.740388648119673,8.18289091462,1.4093396057598209,1218,38,255,18,23,390,160,311,0.11800000000000001,0.823,0.059000000000000004,-0.9586,1,0,3,0,1,0,38.0,2,0,0,1,17,9,1,1,18,0,19,10,2,3,4,45,36,20,0,2,10,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,24,17,8,0,8,8,0,3,9,4,1,5,15,3,21,5,34,20,14,62,0,1,2,0,6,18,0,4,37,166,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23645288383723745,0.0,0.08903535396587653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12093026064734433,0.09323494710828802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0731693253092828,0.15830609137216192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19639887804771175,0.0756599675695959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09838256317079463,0.0,0.0,0.09166728079962344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17420535742219184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174548072649389,0.0,0.07491457530460513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075630905103595,0.0,0.0,0.13739074715615696,0.0,0.09290865294460383,0.0,0.0,0.07457753705015234,0.14222661686871035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07862708649761932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09125226283703174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394339484808924,0.17837763919141922,0.0,0.08756319253825423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449549000869723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2704370318106197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06857659481032997,0.0,0.09456192558025713,0.08344054042713947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12050197371416756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16975852362394586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08507947974391149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11392222795195893,0.09141924930343084,0.0,0.0,0.4028926572913309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08901925158979032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07355126243073366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09477137343320463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06685288315005937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11814211827902805,0.05697302992354645,0.08735836455707037,0.0,0.3110816985155921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098787642673029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07679386103879488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14115289959174104,0.14264421942899214,0.0,0.07994510631867913,0.08242493398947097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2862911620060561

alcoholism,anna_alabama,2020/01/13,"I almost died at my birthday party I’ve been an alcoholic since I was 18. Today I turned 22. I’ve struggled so much over the past few years with drinking, and over the past year I really have been doing great. I’m not sober, I never will be, but I’ve gotten to a place in my daily life where alcohol (mostly) doesn’t control me anymore. 

But on my birthday I lost it and my BAC was around a .3, probably a little higher. I can’t and won’t go into detail about what happened that night, but y’all know what happens when you drink that much, and if my fiancé wasn’t there I know that I would have died. I think that this was a huge wake up call that I can’t let myself get bad again, because now I have so much to look forward to, and I almost threw it all away for some drinks. I just feel stupid right now.

alcoholism,darren_smolik,2020/01/13,"How to approach alcoholic mother Long story short. My father passed nearly 2 years ago and since then my mother has been diving further into alcoholism. She always drank but never this much. We offered help but lied about taking it and eventually she took help when she started dating a new man. This was all relatively recently in December and we had a different Christmas but a sober one. My mother took help from a local rehab centre and we figured we were in the clear. She was clear and so thankful. I had no idea it was that bad but the withdrawal was definitely real and I did not know about the seizures or shaking.

Fast forward to my son's first birthday this weekend. My mom asks me for a glass of wine as if it were nothing. I questioned if she should be drinking and she assured me she can have a little. I refused. From speaking to friends and family I found out she had been drinking again and I've been lied to repeatedly. I know she secretly had the goal of becoming a ""casual drinker"" again. I've never really seen her as an addict until then. 

My wife will be returning to work in a few weeks and my mom was supposed to watch my son a few days of the week. I now know I cannot trust her not to drink or safely take care of my son and I need to say this to her. She was having shakes and drinking 24/7 to stop them. I feel ashamed even writing that she was supposed to watch my son. 

How do I have this conversation? I feel like this is going to cause a large fight within our family but know it needs to happen for my sons safety. Words can barely describe my disappointment. Is it better to talk to a professional? Hire an interventionist? Or just explain my feelings myself? 

Thanks for reading. Always felt very supported by the community.",2.756166150670793,5.172603078947368,3.997268661850708,84.32003095975234,78.15204678362574,6.7135878912968705,24.38630890952872,7.827709963407826,1.4517768145854832,1391,49,263,23,34,454,187,342,0.096,0.73,0.174,0.9839,1,0,8,0,1,0,30.0,5,0,1,4,11,17,1,3,19,0,31,10,0,3,6,63,57,31,0,5,13,12,4,1,1,2,4,2,0,1,13,18,8,3,14,8,0,8,6,6,0,2,23,9,48,11,37,30,4,44,0,1,3,0,49,12,0,6,27,192,61,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11337009461904092,0.0,0.0,0.09218545085879476,0.22227843731295246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17306463846225367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09722145339951624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08683163000450875,0.0,0.11485450395343305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09197528413366086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10603001519888576,0.106831694911154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06706828670130903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10865282708499127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40750273345035465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06868783446962168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19607479754721627,0.0,0.1577492605719017,0.07429417616145212,0.09985167979608714,0.0,0.0,0.08845824554163004,0.0,0.1140253452715596,0.08034641678848327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05910285640146368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196259272717323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20911732768390714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11739789797153875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22861212115374105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050806791121244664,0.10423048917682996,0.0,0.09203246026392528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24359579188561145,0.0,0.0,0.07644842189392685,0.1542222139924443,0.1604149852188585,0.10043919124348497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09978617835064904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07046982423691901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11649840011802308,0.0,0.1040233208787784,0.1183692803548958,0.06662197417193755,0.0,0.10268269250597237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08270113985022554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08602588615173724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360832246565466,0.0,0.0,0.08694462566014871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11801249594370727,0.0,0.0,0.1563828634538649,0.08358738505550216,0.0,0.19148957598373026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310849391549655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08580691335908308,0.0,0.0,0.16683731829019408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07570972838379851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06696948521359564
alcoholism,markbarkmark,2020/01/13,"Help needed!!Difficulty with choosing not to drink with SO Need some advice here. I have decided to quit drinking. Lots of reading and heavy self reflection has lead me to this. I am excited about this new journey. Unfortunately, my SO is not as excited about this decision. We are great together and have a lot of great nights drinking together. However, have the same amount of not great times were her or I taking it too far. We have a night planned at end of the month full of good food, debauchery and all around good times. I have already told her I plan to stick to my plan leading her to say “it’s no fun to drink alone” “why are you doing this” “how long will this be going on?”  What do I do here? I still have that pull to drink and really want to have a great night together. I haven’t had enough sober outings to know how fun it can be without alcohol. Just need some guidance on what to do. Should I drink and then start my journey after that? What can I tell her? 
Really unsure on what to do here. I knew would this decision wouldn’t come easy, and my pst has painted a very different picture with my excessive drinking.",3.273321479374108,5.212841130630633,4.009184447605502,87.12958036984354,74.63063063063062,7.91692745376956,25.64817449027976,8.6894789155246,1.7483747747747749,889,31,184,18,19,283,121,222,0.037000000000000005,0.785,0.17800000000000002,0.9877,2,1,8,0,0,0,23.0,2,1,0,6,13,10,0,0,6,0,29,9,0,4,1,42,39,13,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,0,1,15,13,9,0,7,8,0,7,7,0,0,0,4,1,24,10,30,29,9,27,0,0,0,0,12,7,0,5,13,134,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09335443151319993,0.0,0.1020964777039528,0.0,0.09894410761388008,0.1054238198007076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08504525236629655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08229382830056961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099812389110294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6551066304512102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08461450731571052,0.09871185572428183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551973610416068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054294006506229286,0.16025827949668803,0.0,0.4213049910502655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06403422914516509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05250282621288295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454432324577298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624386804825605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625409241947223,0.0,0.0,0.14167406449924969,0.0,0.09226704824234402,0.0,0.2689557334161097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1016118554541762,0.09555955844550523,0.0,0.122402676262511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597223718936069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09966249013873567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761924858108727,0.0,0.07629334075237458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07182945734596202,0.0,0.08350066957234924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11141294407342894,0.0,0.0,0.09128654977277853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882531227512947,0.05634825479594448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08620431004799567,0.0,0.0,0.09209108313570467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06786440351061851,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,traader_joes,2020/01/13,"I have a problem. Now what? hi y’all. I’m a 22 year old college student. I’ve been in denial about this for a few months now, but it’s kinda hard to ignore at this point. I’ve been severely depressed and unmotivated in a lot of facets of my life and during this have turned to alcohol to cope. What started as a nightly drink turned into drinks turned into drinking in the afternoon to having a shot when I wake up feeling anxious. I’m in my room now as my roommates are downstairs in the kitchen having a great time and all I want is to make myself a drink without needing to talk to them. It’s pitiful that that’s all I can think of.

alcoholism,coorslightisGOOD,2020/01/14,"Last week I relapsed, I think it’s time for Rehab but I don’t know where to begin. I don’t even know where to start. Some background, last Wednesday I convinced myself I can drink like a normal person, I went down to 7/11 and purchased a 15 pack of beer and crawled back into my hole. I tend to keep my drinking private, I live in my parents pool house and that’s where the majority of the consumption occurs. Last night my mom checked up on me because I wasn’t responding to my texts, to her surprise I was passed out in bed, place covered with beer cans. She was very disappointed, and I immediately started to cry. I’m so ashamed of myself and I don’t know what else to do. I keep letting myself go down this road, I want nothing more than to just be normal, I want to be able to watch the game and have a couple beers. I’m starting to realize that I can never be like that. It’s just hard accepting the fact. I’ll be sober for maybe a month and then I convince myself that I can drink like a normal person. I’m looking into Rehab but I don’t know if that’s the right choice, it all seems so scary.

alcoholism,maythedorkbeinyou,2020/01/14,"Lower Intestine Pain when going through Alcohol withdrawals Howdy,

When i give up the booze my body goes through some changes one reoccurring painful one is pain in my lower intestine, originally i was diagnosed with diverticulitis. But after colonoscopy their is no evidence of that, i read up about the leaky gut syndrome and it fits my other symptoms like a glove but its unrecognised and google aint the best place to learn to play doctor. 

Does anyone else suffer when they sporadically quit long term small amount (under 6 standard a day) alcoholism, have lower abdominal pain on your left flank, specifically near the pelvic bone but the whole lower intestine is in pain.

alcoholism,vitalogy95,2020/01/14,"I’ve never been able to moderate my drinking- so is alcoholism something you’re just born with? I shouldn’t say never, but often. When I first started drinking, I was about 14. I always blacked out. Always drank until I was done or the alcohol was gone. 

I’ve made horrible choices during black outs and emotionally hurt my long time partner as well. Although I didn’t drink often (once every few months), it was always to excess. 

In the last year, I began to drink more frequently and with that I began to learn moderation. I’d drink slow, only have one or two. Sometimes a few more if the setting was right, etc. 

Then this weekend I went crazy, blacked out, and acted like a fool. 

So I basically have concluded that I will never moderate my drinking. Is it possible for me, sure, but there’s always the risk of it ending badly and it’s not worth it. I become a 100% different person and i don’t want that. 

I think I struggled so long with it because I’m 24 and all my friends still party but they never end up being as crazy as I am. I wanted to just be “normal” it. 

So basically, if not being able to moderate drinking makes you an alcoholic- was I born one since I’ve never had that ability?",2.8143761301989163,4.79922830379747,4.49497287522604,82.93696202531646,76.08860759493672,7.214707655213985,25.20976491862568,8.11559375814309,1.6545030741410491,936,33,179,16,21,315,136,237,0.141,0.784,0.075,-0.9524,1,0,11,0,0,0,33.0,0,1,1,2,13,9,0,2,8,0,21,11,0,3,7,41,33,24,0,6,11,0,0,1,2,2,3,1,0,2,12,12,11,0,3,8,1,3,10,5,1,4,16,4,25,4,21,12,6,36,0,1,3,0,6,6,0,6,27,131,37,1,0.17890434358815896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28679150251588753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2977254911870026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07468882702834438,0.0545292136606298,0.09879289584635026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934584806005616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09154062887603658,0.0,0.6134035149250759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10062165333517484,0.1584561467966272,0.0,0.09976281716413103,0.0,0.0,0.07536731277704614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07608797163138085,0.0,0.0,0.0691105260323996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09576039999938436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07291545903450343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04370181273486199,0.0,0.0,0.15832471428414666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08464180781458801,0.05971001928004565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07139987010253505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34495514719531395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764413586379759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095263643557627,0.12123021329614048,0.0680324075186362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810618607948004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10084388326203636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639166595378091,0.0,0.07113595735793142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07399576088130005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06886465208479042,0.08847048519045479,0.0,0.06331470760365095,0.0,0.07143661994483276,0.0,0.0,0.09351483210792506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08430761329295074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05731733976525635,0.0,0.0,0.05216028072843785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08738177393388964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055224171000062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08042824521683854,0.0829230594360717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057604265830732276
alcoholism,No_Way_Wei,2020/01/14,"Alcoholic roommate drinks way to much beer My roommate who is also my coworker drinks too much beer and I think the side effects are showing, but I am not sure if it is due to the alcohol, so I don't want to confront him about it unless I am certain.

But lately he has been complaining about how hot it is at work but it's literally below 70 degrees 
The reason I am uncertain is because he is quite a big guy and he can easily down a whole case of beer in a day and only starts too look tipsy after going through the box
From what I have seen he does it close to every other day.

So is it because he is big causing him to complain about the temperature or the excessive beer?",5.251642857142857,4.893927021428572,6.5749999999999975,79.09250000000003,68.07142857142857,9.571428571428571,31.785714285714285,9.188382445141503,2.6018571428571424,533,20,109,9,8,182,88,140,0.08800000000000001,0.858,0.053,-0.6016,0,0,8,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,3,9,6,1,1,9,0,16,8,0,4,2,20,22,13,0,2,7,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,9,4,8,0,3,7,0,1,2,4,0,0,2,3,10,2,17,20,3,16,0,0,2,0,11,8,0,3,6,79,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4076483142979029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15252056997156754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325251114528524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19592435897326724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24600023598459886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16690238702047494,0.0,0.0,0.3736705286643313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16069177993701358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083918893505904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18884508159253785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2151430836381144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16015871370856904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2804056991989497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14505291823140926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2028566632273417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960943091693781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13499423936103078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797535289915726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12220716128462973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11249296546645783,0.1513864997995465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2129346585980533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13884812006373198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I don't want to drink again.,2.7023076923076914,3.9350012820512816,3.7005128205128233,91.68615384615387,74.64102564102564,6.7384615384615385,25.82051282051281,7.1686216300943375,0.8968051282051284,292,10,67,3,6,94,49,78,0.081,0.893,0.026000000000000002,-0.6152,0,0,2,0,0,0,6.0,2,0,0,0,4,3,1,2,4,0,5,4,0,0,0,14,15,6,1,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,4,4,0,3,5,5,4,1,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,10,15,3,11,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,2,1,40,9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29105260339617445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16601819919186764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26679315568247386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28140385682970004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422883490846131,0.0,0.6191168313668498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30130796653976843,0.0,0.29934596371143696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2019394117875024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23258004221084405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18093306096370795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16063537767430394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,luminousconflict,2020/01/14,"High functioning alcoholism. Hi. Long time lurker, first time poster. It took me a long time to admit that I have a problem because aside from the fact that I have to drink to fall asleep, I typically live a pretty normal life. I have a job, a long-term boyfriend, and I go to classes five days a week. The thing is, I weigh roughly 95 pounds, and I basically have to drink a six pack + two more beers to feel drunk. I’ve been drinking heavily since I was eighteen and I’m 25 now, so my tolerance has skyrocketed. I can go through the day feeling just fine, but around 9pm or so the itch starts to kick in. If I try to shrug it off, I get anxious and usually can’t fall asleep until around 5am or later. Sometimes it just feels easier to throw a bunch of beers or some wine back and pass out. I never do anything crazy, ever. I literally got drunk watching King of the Hill last night until I couldn’t keep my eyes open and finally dozed off. When I’m with my boyfriend, I either don’t drink and deal with the insomnia, or I do and tell him I had a “rough day”. I know it’s wrong to keep it from him. I already know. But for a long time my thought process was that if it wasn’t affecting me or our relationship, then why did it matter? Which, yes, is dumb because I know it’s affecting me in the long term. Anyway. I was hoping that I could find people who can relate, or at least won’t judge me. I haven’t had a drink in two days and (surprise) am miserable. But I’m trying. For some reason the thought of never drinking again is terrifying, but I guess that’s a slap in the face as to why I should stop, huh? Yeah. Wish me luck.",1.8867748478701856,3.4656111176470605,3.3159432048681547,92.1708823529412,77.52941176470588,6.689655172413794,22.60649087221095,7.503015589744147,0.6750993914807301,1260,37,290,17,29,413,180,340,0.091,0.802,0.107,-0.1197,1,0,10,0,0,0,46.0,1,0,0,2,12,8,1,1,21,3,28,20,5,3,4,62,51,28,0,9,15,0,5,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,16,15,13,3,11,11,0,7,8,4,0,5,12,7,37,4,34,35,7,51,0,1,2,0,9,12,1,13,32,181,53,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09458434563894844,0.0,0.0,0.09766686603549972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09998484147835886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07283162475562663,0.15757545658118155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06805446224198992,0.0,0.10790298764890413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07066360502245124,0.0,0.0,0.22831220472680736,0.09124420608426508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5202040268334923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800573458184863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13425153394626504,0.0,0.0,0.09695230353551527,0.08089146776457792,0.07528184354782634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046239924443813765,0.0,0.10059824183943783,0.0,0.07078509707626088,0.0,0.09749763440478286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09350981511616688,0.0,0.08790489286705064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08782701435298351,0.1573336508912422,0.0,0.0,0.14591920034520547,0.07214294272223075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06251331340392956,0.0,0.0,0.0781510545538747,0.3916182845639726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13652018244347433,0.0,0.0,0.08305543483021742,0.08671557386163302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0613578448067701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09004084786835373,0.0,0.08468680990183147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09099731933518113,0.0,0.09502066196594458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07321179911137163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08753316827756306,0.0,0.06264390822752071,0.0,0.0,0.0739936866958466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07735679398084591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05879842673116325,0.0,0.0,0.1405253012159431,0.20643063596083389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09833170514068118,0.1201774296621532,0.0,0.17291198314740058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747515250927594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709929346696709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597230078943462,0.0,0.10177575452609876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676572702863342,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Anonymous3687,2020/01/14,"My whole life is falling to pieces HELP.. This is very long please read if you’ve already clicked ‘ this. One night my mom was out, and I was with my friend. My mom had told my friend not to come over because I was asleep, my friend proceeded to come over while my mom was at work. She had came to my window and opened it and yelled my name. I unlocked the door and said wtf why r u here I was asleep. I had told my mom she came over. My mom was more than P-I-S-S-E-D so my friend was freaking out and said why would u tell her, I said I didn’t think it was a problem? So then my mom was supposed to be home at 10:49 pm ish, she works late. 11:00 hits I said oh maybe there’s traffic or an accident. 12:00 hits, I call my grandma who lives right next door.. she had no word about my moms whereabouts. Then I had spammed my moms phone til about 12:30 she finally picked up... My mom had answered and was slurring her words badly (My mom has drank consistently 90% of my life) so I was asking where she was and why she was drunk, she said because she wanted to (as all moms say) I’m the adult I do what I want! Then I ask who she’s with because I can hear her laughing, she yells A MOTORCYCLE GANG! I’m like.. this bitch tweakin there’s no way. Suddenly the phone transferred to a random man who said AYY WE takin’ care of ya mother don’t worry darlin, then the phone switches to another man and basically asks how old I am. I was obviously pissed and scared for her, I was cursing at all these strange men. I had a panic attack and handed the phone to my friend. I started hyperventilating. My friend was yelling at the men and then came to me to see if I was okay. I had called my grandma after and told her everything that happened. We decided to call again and she wasn’t answering, we had probably called her 60 times and she wasn’t picking up. We called my grandma back and let her know she wasn’t answering, my grandma suggested she try calling. She had told me my mom didn’t answer. We all decided to call the cops. We had been waiting for about 30 minutes so by the time we called it was 1:00 am.  We called the cops and they showed up. They questioned us and asked where she may be. My friend was saying WAY too much, she was telling them that my mom drinks a lot 24/7.  My grandfather was there with us and was trying to intervene to get my friend to stop talking. I told them she goes to some bars and looked on her previous Facebook posts of where she liked to go. And it was about 2:30 am when my mom had decided to pull in the driveway. She was so drunk. Basically it’s my house first and my grandparents, she passed my house seeing all the flashing lights and cops and still decided to pull in. ( she pulled into my grandparents drive way and it leads to our driveway) she could have drove by and avoided it. So she pulls up and says whattt is happeeeenning (best I can describe her slurs) then she asks if my dog is okay and that’s why they’re here. Immediately they can tell she’s intoxicated. Basically we were sent inside and the cop comes in and says ur mom wants to know if the dog is okay. I was in utter shock that she’s worried about the dog and not me. I broke down crying and asked if he’s serious and that’s the first thing she said to them and he said I’m so sorry. I said tell her the dogs perfectly fucking fine. He leaves and tells her. From my POV it looked like my mom was resisting arrest. My papa came in and told me she was. But apparently she says she wasn’t. She had been released shortly after. Once she got home she started getting in my friends face. Then I had stepped in front of her and told her to stop and she was making a fool of herself. She was still slightly intoxicated. Fuck the cops for not releasing her when she was sober. Basically my mom had started punching me and grabbing my hair, she had kicked me in my stomach. My grandpa saw all of this 
Basically I was standing in front of the couch and she was standing right in front of me and kicked me so from behind my mom he couldn’t see her kick me. Bizarre that he couldn’t. The last time she beat me like this it was thanksgiving eve because she potato’s were not peeled and she had tried to strangle my dad and hurt me. But anyways back to this, I had never stood up for myself and fought back before. So I had grabbed her hair and started fighting her back. I had broke her glasses and pushed her into her room. I didn’t want my friend to see this. So we were fighting in her room, she was dirty fighting and kicking me like a little bitch. I had pushed her into the floor and she had fell a bit too so thank god she did. And then she got up and pushed me against the wall and was being horrible and backing me up into a corner, I thought I was gonna die right there. My papa ( grandpa) came storming in and thankfully told her to get off. My grandpa was just yelling and trying to get her off earlier but my moms really strong. Then I went into the my room and mom came in and goes I’m gonna kill u, then she goes oh I thought u were —— (my friend) I go I’m not but ur not gonna touch her, her dads literally a cop. I had followed my mom to my friend and once again here we are. I convinced her to get away and to not start more problems.  She was screaming I WANT THESE LITTLE BITCHES OUT!  Then my papa took me and my friend to her house to drop her off. Once my friend got home she called cops and told them what she did to me. I had told her not to. On our way back to my house my mom was on a different road and was caught by the cops. I was yelling papa that’s mom! We had driven past once again and we were right. The head cop idk what they’re called came to me and started screaming at me DID SHE KICK U. I was crying the whole ride and could barley talk. I ignored him, his tone intensified, DID YOUR MOTHER KICK YOU?! I said YES. They asked if I needed an ambulance and did she leave any bruises I said no. There was no bruising. They didn’t arrest her and she agreed to be quiet and okay for the night. They told me I could not be in the house. Basically I had to live with my dad, 2 weeks later I was back home and it was okay. 



NOW- 
My moms getting her license taken away and idk what to do she’s blaming my friend because they have it on camera, my friend saying a bunch of shit. Apparently they wouldn’t have taken away license if she didn’t say everything she said.  My friend and I have had our ups and downs but we’re trying to get better.  I know everyone must be thinking my moms a piece of garbage but I do love my mom, she’s so different sober. She’s caring, she’s an animal lover, we do fight but it’s normal, she’s my mom. My moms been though a lot, she’s been raped. She opened up to me awhile ago, I’ve had a really bad experience with a man before aswell. So she’s kind of understanding of that. I love my mom she’s the best thing I have. But I don’t know what to do I really wanna be in my friends life and her to be in mine. But today it was declared she’ll lose her license for 2 years.

alcoholism,tonykosto,2020/01/14,"Leaving a alcoholic On December 26, 2019 I made the very difficult decision to leave my girlfriend of one year due to her drinking. I had been with this woman for one year. We met in January 2019 in MLK day via a dating app.  Before I said hello to her I knew I found my one as I walked in the restaurant. It was a magical connection. Within the first 2 weeks there were a couple of minor incidents. One was when people from the lighting industry came to Denver for a holiday event, she had gotten so drunk the night before she had to Uber to my place the next day and have me coddle her. A week later, she went to Vegas for 36 hours. Landed in Denver at 3:00 pm and stumbled to my apt absolutely lit up drunk and non functioning. All within 2 weeks.

I thought hmmm but hey it’s early don’t judge. February was the after work drinks of vodka and soda. About 3-5 per night but each our was easily 3-4 shots of vodka. A gallon would be consumed every 3 days and sometimes 2 days. At this point I was becoming concerned. I loved her by now and thought maybe a loving relationship that wasn’t like her marriage might perhaps open her eyes up to reaching her pinnacle with me. For weeks I told her I needed her to take me to the airport in March in the morning for a flight to Florida. Sadly, expecting the worst, I made a backup plan with my 21 year old student I taught at the hospital I was working at.  Sure enough, she drank so much she was unable to take me. At this point I was ready to walk and regrettably did not.

I believed in her and the power of love. By this time we moved in together and there were many great times but the drinking continued. I had plans as a newbie to Denver to try a few restaurants and concert venues. She nearly passed out at Wicked at the performing arts center. Could barely walk and people were staring at her. I was to embarrassed to look up. The night before at red rocks we saw a prince tribute by the Colorado symphony stained ruined before we got the by her drunk and being super overly friendly with the Uber driver. 

Last incident I’ll share amongst the many we’re the hallucinations in the middle of the night thinking I was face timing other women at 2 am. To me hiding her phone and iPad or me responsible for finding everything from her hair brush, acrylic nails to car keys. Several times she would forget her purse or sunglasses at restaurants and places. It never ended for me. I began to lose myself. I no longer wanted to go out. I stayed on fearing her drunk. I would tell staff and her hair stylist to not serve her as much when we would show up and she got livid at me for that. I became a shell of myself. I fell into deep depression and became angry punching doors no less. I never did that. I saw the love of my life falling into the abyss and me no longer caring. 

After 2.6 years in Denver I packed up and moved to St. Louis to get as far away from her and Denver. I hated Denver after her. Ruined my dreams and vision I had there. A happy home. A great partner and a future filled with endless opportunities. 

Why do I feel so miserable and guilty like I quit? For fucks sake I feel so lonely and depressed. I’m 47, in shape, educated and a huge hear. She was 45 and a sales professional. I wake up thinking about her. All day all night hoping for a miracle that she will quit drinking after losing me and will search for me again, I feel like hell and I can’t stop crying, this really changed me. Any advice? Why the guilt? Why the love? Why the hoping someday again? Appreciate it.

alcoholism,Hold_My_Coffee82,2020/01/14,"Alcoholism is like that one friend... It’s like that one friend. You have a great time. Then you hang out again. And it’s fun. You guys click and the chemistry is great. Then one day they just show up unexpected. You’re ok with it. Then again. And again. Now they’ve worn out their welcome. But you keep letting them in. Now you can’t get them off your couch. You don’t know what to do. The cops show up and they leave for a day or two. Then again. Finally you’ve had enough. They’ve put you through hell and worn you down. They’ve made you do things you normally wouldn’t; they’re such a bad influence. They took your money, kept you up at night... Your relationship started out great. It was fun. But in the end the friendship just had to end. So you cut ties. You told them it was over. It was hard but you did it. Last time you ever saw them was years ago and you’re living life to the fullest. You’re sleeping, your job is going great. Everything is great. Then a friend comes over with that old friend one day and being the new better person you are you respectfully say hi, shake hands and go on your way. It’s been 2.5 years since I’ve seen that friend. If that friend is on your couch be strong and tell them to leave. You’ll thank yourself that you did. Some friends just don’t fit right in the end and that’s ok, there’s more to life.",0.11902478017585948,2.4489167338129505,0.6223860911271011,104.35449840127899,90.29496402877695,4.239968025579536,14.197042366107116,5.82211442006289,-1.1984487609912071,1044,18,256,8,36,311,133,278,0.049,0.706,0.245,0.9966,1,0,1,0,0,0,44.0,0,25,9,2,13,27,2,1,11,2,26,5,2,2,1,33,42,21,0,3,8,0,2,2,7,2,3,1,2,2,17,16,1,2,1,2,1,7,4,4,0,5,17,6,34,23,25,20,3,55,1,0,3,0,49,18,1,3,31,153,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08051012657950106,0.09706339209302786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07583436928106597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032657755429483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07823696079248038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1757221839722937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24132970945848434,0.0938456230015995,0.0,0.0,0.08215564102720847,0.0,0.0,0.08162688723212043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994934139346084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4911935764170648,0.0,0.0474518683437791,0.0,0.10323491192510564,0.0,0.0,0.5006697152623498,0.0,0.08993018519419711,0.0,0.0,0.0813605963138613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012895181455104,0.08072867525128646,0.0,0.0,0.049914576107808833,0.07403380219939094,0.0,0.19233931607048765,0.0,0.09287384415409022,0.1283035624758044,0.08874418134669104,0.0,0.08019938605488125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08594000422569988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771852743815296,0.0,0.08523230965888981,0.08898838057655965,0.0,0.0,0.09530466434129417,0.0,0.2461791710728839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07930414218500338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09130335384964172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09751114422830696,0.0,0.07756332555251368,0.0,0.07222700735943148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07513067321001618,0.0,0.09088973942823683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428579893905471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07938430798986815,0.08361867223885415,0.0,0.0,0.060339527748553126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10592058137593456,0.0,0.0,0.08678636494304696,0.10090896952101652,0.0,0.0,0.08872199466223299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07209198062276917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11697554616876345

alcoholism,Amos_Moses666,2020/01/14,"Should I expect or be concerned about withdrawals? So here’s the deal. I’m typically a night time drinker. Maybe something like 6-9 drinks a night if I have work the next day. In the past i would drink like this most but not every night. For the last month or so I’ve only not drank at night for like a day and a half. I typically go through a fifth of vodka every 2-3 days. This past weekend I was out of town for a wedding and hit it pretty hard so I’ve decided I should give my liver a rest and change my drinking habits once and for all.

My last drink was yesterday around midnight. It’s currently 8:15 pm. I haven’t had any symptoms with the exception of anxiety, but I’m a naturally anxious person. 

I always figured even though I drink just about everyday, I’m sober for more hours in a day than not.

I'm writing this from the seat next to my hospital bed. Enjoying a rich tea biscuit and coffee. The amount of guilt and remorse over my nieveity is completely overwhelming. So much that I am actually crying. 

I'm here because I have a serious problem with alcohol. I've always known it, yet despite this knowledge, I persist with going through the cycle of binge drinking to the point of almost annihilation, hitting the depths of crippling withdrawals, where I'm physically incapable of even standing. I go through a painful recovery, vowing to never drink again. I'll be successful in my sobriety for maybe a month. And build my life back up. Seemingly recovered. That's when I decide, ""I can have a couple, I'm ok now. I've got a job, I'm back on track. I'm not going to let myself decend back in to that situation again"". Yeah right. It happens again. And again. And so many times that nobody knows how many times I've done this whole routine. Drink to the point of collapse, pick myself up, regain momentum, the trust of others, become human again. Well the thing is with humans as we all know is they are predictable creatures that follow the same patterns. Why do you think people have routines? Why do you think we have tradition? Why is it that we have sayings like ""once a crook, always a crook""? I could go on, but you get my point.

So here I, this human, is again. Sat on a hospital ward. Taking medications designed to hinder the effects of serious alcohol misuse. With the same guilt as I felt last time. With the same determination to never be here again. With the same plan to get counciling. With the same lump in my throat. The same feelings of pain inside. Except this time. I've decided, I'm not going to try and fix myself. Patch up the beaten and rundown shell of a person. Instead, I'm going to kill that person. He once existed. But just like all things that existed, that's all they did, they exist in the past. Not the present or the future. 

When a person is born. They aren't manufactured in a factory with exact specifications. Like a product designed to a perform a certain task that has exact limitations on its capabilities. You can build a car and that car is that car and it has it's own strengths and it's own weaknesses. You can ad parts here and there and it with perform slightly better at certain things. But it's still the same car. No matter what. 

It takes a lot of designing an engineering to make anything good. It also takes a lot of reengineering and trial and error to create a truly magnificent specimen. Nobody in the history of the planet has ever hit the nail on the head the very first time. Ever heard of the Delorean? It takes time and conscientiousness for something to become truly great. Elon Musk blew up his first three rockets costing billions. In fact his first successful launch, had it not worked would have been his last, because he had no more cash left to perform another. So sometimes it's better to not aim for immediate perfection because in the end, it will ultimately fail. No matter how sure you think you are. 

Three weeks ago. I was sailing smoothly. I was about to get my driver's license back after an almost 8 year absence. I was working a high pressure IT contractor job that paid handsomely. My own place. And my proud and loving father, in preperation for the return of me regaining road legal status. Had bought me a car that he knew I would love. It wasnt anything fancy, but he knew I would love and cherish that car like a baby. He went out of his way to get ot certified for road use. He fixed it up where it needed work. Himself, with his own two hands. He fitted parts that didn't even need doing. He just wanted to give me something to be proud of. I was so happy and appreciated it so much. Everything was looking good and everything was on track. All we had to do is wait for my license in the mail. It got to Christmas. We had a lovely Christmas Day together. Things were looking so great in fact, when I got home I figured I'll have few beers. And then that's when it all went pear shaped. I finished the beers and I didn't really feel like I was happy enough, so I got a few more. The next thing I knew I was black out drunk. By this point is was the next day. Me in my drunken stupor decided ""FLIP IT! IM GONNA JUST GET FULL ON DRUNKED UP TODAY"" Which carried on to the next day. By this point I had been ignoring calls. So I figured people are gonna know somethings up. So I locked the door, turned the lights out and made the decision that if anyone comes knocking, I'll just make it seem like no one's home. Two weeks pass. By this point my body was completely dependent on alcohol to the point where I couldn't even get a jacket on with any sort of ease because of the withdrawal. My apartment had descend in to a disgusting mess. I was a mess. And all I could think about is how much of a disgrace I am. I had completely betrayed my dad. He didn't deserve the treatment I was giving him. He's done so much for me and would never ever do this to me or anyone else, so why was I doing this to him? Because I was ashamed? Because I was scared? I decided to open the door. He didn't even need to say his piece. His eyes said it all. 

He left. And I was alone. Fighting the worst withdrawals I had ever faced. A day or two go by. The symptoms begin to subside. I conger the strength to begin the clean up operation. I do bits here and there. But I'm weak. And it's hard. I'm shaking. I'm sweating. It comes and goes. But I cant sleep. My sides are hurting but I know it's just inflammation and will subside eventually. And then the visual flashes start. The phantom noises. I'm hallucinating all over the place. And so I try and sleep. But when i close my eyes something I've never known occurred. I was still seeing things. Things like from a dream. And its intense. From disgusting creatures about to attack me to me flying directly to the ground. So many things I can even begin to describe. So I'm laid awake alone, with the light on because in the dark the outside hallucinations are there. I'm in hell. This is full on Delirium Tremons or DT. Which is one of the most likely things to kill you without sedatives. I call an ambulance. In the hospital the bloods show I have pancreatitis. And that I'm most likely going to need immediate surgery. Then move me to the surgical decisions unit. Put me in a room on my own. So now all I can think about is how I've completely fucked my life. How have I become this? Was it worth it? I might die. And all I can think about is how my guilty my dads gonna feel at my funeral. Something he 100% does not deserve. He's the best dad anyone could have ever asked for. He would do anything for his kids. This isn't his fault. At all. On that bed all I wanted to tell him is how he's not to blame. How much i love him. And how much I admire him. But I can't. And the most horrible thing is, is that I'm his only son. The curtain opens and it's a specialist on pancreatitis. She asked me to explain everything. So I do. She says to me. ""Well from looking at your bloodwork, people with pancreatitis have certain markers. Usually we would expect to see a level of 600. Yours is 100. So it doesn't make sense why you've been referred to us. I'm going to go and speak with one of me other colleagues and see if there's anything I'm missing"" she leaves. I dont even care about the second opinion, I cant flippin believe it!! I a flippin miracle!! In my eyes I've been given a second chance. I'm crying like crazy. Even though he hates me right now I didn't care all i want to do is call my dad and tell him how sorry I am. But its 3.30am and I dont think he would appreciate that very much. 

I text my dad in the morning. Tell him I'm here. And not much else. 

I text him again and give him the rundown of my intentions. And now were talking again. And that to me is all I need.

Thanks for reading my story full of typos and grammatical errors. But I'm sat on the chair next to my hospital bed as we speak and the top half of my touch screen doesn't work so it's pretty hard to correct stuff.

Talking with my brother today , he's  a huge AA fan ,  works the program religiouslv he's been clean sober 8 years , ,.Me however,,AA isn't my thing ,I'm the total opposite , I know it works for and has saved a ton of alcoholics , but I'm not there and I do not like AA , he knows this ,it just me.  Any way , we hadn't seen each other in a month ,we happened to run into each other , I opened my big mouth asking had he read a Reddit comment (s) about alcoholism and had he read it ? Answered not yet , but promised he would definitely read it today.. Well he's still a smooth dog ,a player from way back , and had me promising 3 meetings , in return that he would take a look at my text and join Reddit.

alcoholism,hshshshsha,2020/01/15,"When is it safe to start working out again So I’m on day 4 of my complete alcohol purge cold turkey. I have not had a lot of withdrawal symptoms (some sweating and some restlessness). I had was unaware that alcohol withdrawal could kill you until yesterday and flipped my shit when I called a rehab center and said I could be at risk for detox related death for months. 

I’ve been working and have a general sense of happiness. I have had some issues sleeping but I chalk that up to the mass amounts of caffeine and b vitamins  I regularly consume and now not having a “go to sleep remedy.” Also I typically work out about 2 hours a day but heard my heart can be sensitive for some time during withdrawal period. Is there a time period where I should most likely be safe to do extensive cardio again?

alcoholism,After-Hope,2020/01/15,"my girlfriend is an alcoholic and I just don't know what to do I just wanted someone to talk to. I feel so alone in real life because I don't have anyone who would understand. I am so heartbroken and tired. Is there such a thing as AA for people whose loved ones are alcoholics? I might need to go for that, if it exists. I am starting to feel like I desperately need help myself.

My girlfriend is just.. a horrible person when she drinks. She becomes this really angry, cruel, irrational, violent person. She says terrible things to me, which I can't help but feel are her honest feelings that she's only letting out when she's been drinking. It's awful because she's so different when she's sober. It makes me feel like I'm dating two people. Or rather, it makes me feel like I need to figure out which one is the real personality, if that makes sense. 

I used to think that the sober her was the real personality, but recently I've been losing hope. I've been feeling like she's actually been Mr Hyde all along. The reason why I've been losing hope is because we had a big fight about her drinking some time back, and she agreed that it was ruining her life and that she had to quit. I told her it was okay to do it at her own pace and that all I wanted was transparency. Meaning that I wanted to know how often she was drinking, and how much. Because I was quite sure that she drank much more often than I knew about, and I felt like it would help if a) she could be more conscious of when and how much she was drinking, and b) if I could get a better sense for how bad her problem was. 

She's tried quitting before, but not very seriously. She's supposed to be going to AA now, but obviously I don't know if/when she's actually going. I don't really want to go into it because I'm so worn down already, but suffice to say that recently I keep accidentally-or-otherwise discovering that she's been drinking but didn't tell me/outright lied about it. Or otherwise meaning that she appeared obviously drunk, so I questioned her until she admitted that she'd been drinking. That's one thing that's really awful by the way. The way she'll be so obviously drunk but refuse to admit that she's been drinking. It makes me feel like, if she's willing to lie about this stuff, and in fact if that's her first instinct, then what else has she been lying about? It makes me feel... bad, as well, almost ashamed, because I feel like I've allowed myself to be abused. Or that I've been stupid for believing in her all this time.

I don't really know what to do. Since not drinking is self-reported, I guess part of me wonders if she'll just lie at AA like she's been lying to me. At one point she was visibly drunk, and she insisted to me that she was going to receive her one month chip in a few days. I don't know if she genuinely had been sober for the rest of the month before that, but it's pretty obvious that she wouldn't qualify for a one month chip now. Would an alcoholic lie just to get the chip? Would AA find out? I don't see how AA could find out unless they admitted to it, or they came into a meeting drunk. 

I don't know what to do. I really don't. If any of you have any advice or words of comfort, I would really appreciate it.",4.339275627063866,4.837516996978851,5.493944354668732,83.09452153446219,70.1178247734139,8.75632684606197,27.177826178599034,8.841846274778883,1.8365494554907609,2540,78,536,43,43,846,234,662,0.14400000000000002,0.736,0.12,-0.9646,2,1,12,0,2,0,76.0,1,1,2,7,34,30,4,1,19,3,72,21,0,13,9,136,132,53,0,29,31,0,11,8,2,10,6,2,0,5,51,20,17,2,32,13,0,8,14,13,6,8,32,14,89,17,62,81,13,46,0,3,1,1,73,16,0,25,28,376,140,1,0.0,0.059928732695450876,0.09871707924939642,0.0,0.0,0.04942594615310755,0.0,0.16216311087612387,0.050648313232456506,0.0523853667771458,0.05581601169075643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06879192868595463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03536653712408985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038892705523348836,0.08446395679337873,0.18499767621978336,0.055861359846313983,0.0860792834740918,0.05698605748539772,0.0,0.04473367841143185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0578497592149127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12115144360044845,0.0,0.0,0.032619754286837374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05284507322912528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4459400903592465,0.0,0.0,0.04225289073742893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25574641269240805,0.21680510034101813,0.04856449180791067,0.0,0.09245795004395886,0.043023109373038174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052851663375734666,0.0,0.1437281872170107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05571929685734399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017076204219776,0.0,0.0,0.10047420844155246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04495760565462907,0.0,0.0,0.16678384641549626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05172122109166567,0.07145194626217229,0.19768568710974088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11317160453826715,0.0,0.0,0.04565019899355708,0.0,0.16881187887338356,0.0,0.0,0.11019235106944472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053657121525922134,0.0,0.0,0.12111682128381908,0.0,0.11154580773334563,0.11251273083230702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20564488502432995,0.03846817896218205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054772940113293686,0.0,0.0701312599056773,0.17665714642456984,0.0,0.0,0.04781421241631655,0.0,0.0,0.051457789332964916,0.0,0.04839798964999427,0.0,0.0,0.056660895537464326,0.16139336980972355,0.0,0.17271248589437008,0.19441609748622485,0.05200440687831452,0.09988280195594504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08044609438645697,0.0,0.0,0.04030551203814209,0.0,0.052765710113989166,0.0,0.0,0.0418400917422324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042856057899759714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035800607267474485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057901712464727764,0.0,0.0,0.047670815635023116,0.0,0.0,0.04065408699245221,0.044208930750628636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10080881491472653,0.03240946137503785,0.0,0.0,0.058986917763554275,0.05813398185634192,0.0,0.048331118517221716,0.0,0.03434032999763531,0.0,0.0494090660660657,0.052655303371445375,0.0,0.043684664068537236,0.0,0.04173359075580207,0.1193329877209799,0.08029570225476895,0.0,0.0,0.04547726948760535,0.0,0.04564035705145473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05485158111101469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17965201540294934,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,catherineyb,2020/01/15,"Day one of sobriety I’ve just poured all my alcohol down the drain and decided today’s the day I become sober. After two years of constant drinking day in and out, I’ve finally made the decision to end it. I feel so relieved, I just hope and pray I’m able to follow through with this without breaking. No one knows about my drinking problem so I have to do this on my own and it’s scary but I’m ready for the better version of myself once I see this threw.",2.2815625,3.844279031250004,3.84,88.905,76.39583333333334,6.883333333333333,26.583333333333336,7.645422480735847,1.407858333333334,361,14,77,5,8,120,64,96,0.040999999999999995,0.807,0.152,0.8594,0,0,3,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,1,5,4,0,0,4,0,2,3,0,1,1,18,11,7,0,2,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,6,3,0,4,2,0,2,2,1,0,3,2,2,9,3,16,9,3,16,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,1,9,51,14,0,0.1998567708722788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21358610773728934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207261014794025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1767570726483164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.215974168894326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38667325042346257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3915670983750235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1770137783604586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10105358837708724,0.0,0.0,0.2189333235687982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985028684366705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10983605456530687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18910930893390784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21284093835958973,0.2708562405538806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19123593847829687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15925997084185314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189440850148078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1952310248176056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19265479521537665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870120788012526
alcoholism,Sad_Farm,2020/01/15,"Alcohol Withdrawal? Hangover? I’m not sure if this is the right sub but here goes. I’ve been a heavy drinker for the last couple years due to college. I was in a fraternity that often saw me drinking heavily minimum 3x a week ranging all the way to 6x a wk. The goal was usually to get as drunk as possible every time because I had social anxiety and I thought it helped. However I wouldn’t-consider myself dependent and only drank in social situations. Never alone. Around my Junior year I started experiencing weird hangover symptoms that I at first attributed to getting older, but it seemed like something more. They involved extreme bouts of anxiety and depression to the point were I couldn’t leave my bed and my body felt off. This only happened if I had drank in extreme excess the night before or heavy for 3 or more days prior, if it was just one day I was fine.

Fast forward to my senior year and I am now getting these more frequently were my body felt off, and I was hit with insane bouts of anxiety. But it got really bad after one particularly heavy wknd of drinking. I woke up that day feeling horrid, completely nauseated, anxiety, shakes. I was incredibly nauseous and tried making myself throw up. After this I couldn’t stop throwing up for the rest of the day probably over 20times. As soon as anything touched my stomach extreme naseau. The worse part lasted about a day but I didn’t feel fully recovered for another 2-3 days.

This year I graduated and went back to visit for a big day long drinking event. I had not been drinking significantly since I graduated a couple months prior, maybe once every couple weeks. Went up for the weekend and drank everyday and on the day of the event, I consumed pedialyte in the morning and ate breakfast and lunch. Although I didn’t eat dinner and drank little to no water all day. Spent the whole day drinking non stop also. The next day driving back the same thing from before starts happening I initially woke up with the shakes. Feeling depressed and nauseous. Felt worse as the day went on and got food. Food didn’t help made me more nauseous. Got to the point where I could barely move or talk to not get sick. When I got home I started throwing up and couldnt stop like previously but this time it was way worse. I felt like my body was shutting down, im not sure if I was delirious as this was a while ago but I remember feeling like I was going to have a seizure or something was going to happen( even though I had nvr experienced one before). Very confused and out of sorts. It got so bad I thought I was gna have to go the hospital. Thought I’d feel better after 2days but still felt like shit for 5 days.

So I basically want to know if anyone has experienced something similar or knows what is happening. After researching the closest thing I found to my symptoms was withdrawal, but I thought this is only the case when you’ve been drinking everyday over a long period. Is this just some weird hangover. Please help.

Also note I know this is a sign I should cut down regardless. But I still want to be able to go out and drink with my friends. Now that college is over I don’t go out nearly as much, and I only drink at social settings. But sometimes I’m scared if I overdo it one night this will happen.",3.8646686623231794,5.95066761014263,4.731723014615252,81.9510822034396,73.37400950871633,7.653471855373597,28.483917356342076,8.458729078192134,2.200997511298937,2606,106,482,47,54,843,279,631,0.133,0.7859999999999999,0.081,-0.9897,1,1,13,0,0,0,56.0,0,0,1,3,22,22,2,4,33,0,44,30,5,4,5,99,104,56,0,14,27,0,11,5,1,2,4,1,2,0,25,26,22,3,20,10,1,17,13,12,0,5,54,16,54,10,72,42,12,120,0,2,1,0,11,35,1,17,72,313,79,9,0.048080239182720835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042620231039852345,0.05138315355189027,0.0,0.04979662755184276,0.0,0.07689949980701978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050416322976364426,0.14712500549351853,0.0,0.0,0.0336188211578019,0.0,0.03956594014550103,0.04280160647527891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07394147223092981,0.08028998280927914,0.02930926754114086,0.0,0.1227382268026488,0.0,0.0,0.04252306435792316,0.0,0.16021892045388186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05041121601825197,0.0,0.0,0.03838815866273306,0.15959961046474722,0.0,0.4031010970208195,0.0,0.08282287911082567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3768026404867019,0.0,0.04919808792879419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031756544524651736,0.0,0.08101935039030879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12155406790164687,0.03434853247902181,0.23082284801889566,0.0,0.0,0.04089702688702078,0.11627763213782485,0.052717500588208815,0.03714667352438005,0.0,0.1004797621371249,0.0,0.13662553968543512,0.0,0.19227079743929856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21258598360925848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09668151250869914,0.0,0.04822840012335116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05193490892780603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07927092614382113,0.07838362423591473,0.0,0.05091003105600987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11744788118994055,0.04818903079313315,0.0,0.0850989973596319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045494684846239065,0.03209393300364208,0.0,0.04830306268242504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03837718820340925,0.05110168519787476,0.03534450798252426,0.0,0.03708244451043973,0.0,0.05113387982924465,0.09024009485651548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0512038855603428,0.13032165758632785,0.1462687539080571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052066213649782166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052777664397779804,0.0909027338687553,0.054203245489831665,0.0,0.0,0.051838629860241785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03080143238533788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05446553831154531,0.04106026155607993,0.0,0.0,0.04813670708744527,0.0,0.0,0.043770443984453226,0.0,0.0,0.049353674589460314,0.03977247069942911,0.05404420332443103,0.0,0.14703524687846814,0.0,0.11104355133244706,0.047552585960243435,0.0,0.10209432228348836,0.0,0.07679388223819547,0.12059169854205325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09063011284691236,0.09994755621125992,0.0,0.038645075007980284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06388474898097356,0.0,0.047238590880315234,0.15268135718499035,0.05607194823697157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03264332633527834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052953590734739805,0.03967123269573742,0.056717941572022625,0.0763277118246464,0.07713413543411747,0.0,0.0,0.13371259025305812,0.0,0.053679870003178316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469936140108253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12384839064443835

alcoholism,bowchikabauhaus,2020/01/15,I don’t know how to stop and be happy/ stay alive. I had started drinking and drugging a few years back. I stopped using daily about 9 months ago and started only using socially. I have been in a really dark and depressing state this past week and these past three nights after getting home from work I’ve gotten drunk and now don’t know what to do with myself when I’m not drunk. It feels good for the first 15 minutes then I feel worse than I did before the drink hit me. I don’t want to go down that path again but I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid I’ll hurt myself in a drastic way if I don’t. I’m just kinda venting and don’t know what I’m looking for posting here.

alcoholism,ilikecheesenbooze,2020/01/15,"Idk help me Ok throwaway.   I'm 40 FM divorced once with 2 children. Never was onto drugs or drank until 25 or so and slowly crept into 30s. Drank through then until early 30s and stopped easily when I had kids.  21 months apart.  Was scared to ease back into it. Easily did I feel back into it. Always maintained a high paying job. Kids are great.  Ended up becoming highly successful. Divorced. Amicable.  Met a great guy 3 years ago. Great relationship.  Hes highly successful.  I'm doing great.  Kids are great.  Then I found myself drinking a handle of rum over 3 days.  Still remained my schedule.  Got the kids to school fine. Worked great. My SO rarely drinks. I drink every night.  I like it. My mind can rest. I produce better when I'm under the influence with work
  Things around the house are done. Since it's not what he does he considered it bad. I did a blood panel and it came out fine. He insists I am killing myself and 0ur relationship and I don't now what to conclude


We came up with 3 things to better ourselves and he wants me to quit. I do nothing outside of drinking and when I stop I go crazy.  I cant sleep. I cant be not annoyed. I have unrest and am mad.

alcoholism,noputa,2020/01/15,"Coworker is constantly drinking at work.. what can I do? I have my own big issues with alcohol, but I’m looking for some advice since I’ve never been on this side of it, where I know someone has a problem and they promised to get in under control, but they aren’t. 

He’s been employed for a few months now, and my boss was about to fire him for being late and always smelling of alcohol everyday. This isn’t the sort of position you can drink in, he has to climb high shelves on ladders and stuff. He said he knew and it wouldn’t happen again. He hasn’t been late since, but he’s smelling stronger of alcohol everyday. I kinda was behind the scenes asking my boss to give him a second chance, but I guess he’s a typical alcoholic thinking he’s sneaky. 

I don’t want to be direct and tell him he’s not as sneaky as he thinks, that would be a bad idea right?  I’m not his boss, I was the one to train him. He’s a really great worker and a nice guy aside from the booze. Last thing I want is for him to fall and break his neck while I was aware of all of this.. 

So I don’t know, should I mention this to the boss to fire him, or do I let him know that most of his coworkers know and it can’t continue? Should I open up 1 to 1 about my own problem with it? Or just get him fired? :( this situation is kind of eye opening about what my family had to go through with me. It’s hard, and he isn’t even family.",2.3912818181818167,3.2557242433333333,3.770181818181822,92.32009090909092,74.9,7.587878787878788,23.63636363636364,8.00094639256281,0.8999999999999999,1083,30,260,16,22,357,147,300,0.114,0.8140000000000001,0.073,-0.922,2,0,6,0,0,0,33.0,0,1,2,4,9,7,0,0,12,0,33,9,2,5,2,52,53,20,0,8,9,0,4,0,0,4,4,1,0,1,16,15,7,1,8,2,0,3,11,3,0,2,10,9,33,4,41,35,6,30,0,0,2,0,32,14,0,7,12,169,49,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11307781200439801,0.0,0.4946673071641551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962862386792483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10818025160941172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09661928775063798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250495194605307,0.12978702769449502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267182123632075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07643032433278013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21817634062471092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12091524635275598,0.11100678037319783,0.06576492793284126,0.0,0.0,0.12757896385390224,0.12747588393218548,0.11457852848412528,0.10232861237938416,0.0,0.10366016017984032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12226190318402075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13063098417987962,0.0,0.12077901661740002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12050198010392806,0.25438127000368504,0.09432521567450716,0.26106878430628194,0.0,0.0,0.1183289945957577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971735646270772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09236461287813492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08924847786210181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841317991301344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22145205913023336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413160034770469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09882212170419977,0.11007385153649347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19144544096815255,0.13007133018475905,0.0,0.0,0.0980470711360158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13246886435997016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10114220463983432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07687757212916731,0.14829421653063946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136506371670011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424372583881055,0.0,0.0,0.08220239936739653,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,bezosboss,2020/01/15,"Looking for tips on addressing a loved ones alcoholism. Hello all.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I am looking for some tips and advice on what to do and how to approach my father to speak with him about his alcoholism. 

He is a very highly functioning alcoholic, with many many years under his belt. Him and I have a wonderful relationship, and he respects me very much. But I have never confronted him about his alcoholism before. Honestly, his drinking has never had a negative physical impact on me, he has never been abusive (physically, verbally, or otherwise) to me. I can’t say the same for my brother and sister though, he can be very mean and verbally abusive when he gets belligerent and it has caused a tremendous strain on his relationship with my sister. For me though, it just makes me tremendously sad.

A few years back things got bad when he was arrested for a domestic dispute, and I had really hoped that it was a wake up call for him but it doesn’t seem so. Us kids are all grown up now in our 20s but he recently had another son who is 3 now (who I love very much). He has expressed to me that he is looking to be a better father for his new son, and I think that is wonderful. He hasn’t been the worlds greatest dad but he is my best friend and beneath his troubles he is a good man. I had thought things had gotten better until recently.

It was brought to my attention during a visit a few months ago by his wife that he started drinking again. Low and behold I found his stash, about 8 or so handles of various liquor, many at least half empty. It broke my heart. And over Christmas we had gone to visit and he was openly drinking. I haven’t seen him drink in 3 years... I am not naive, it wasn’t surprising to hear that he was drinking again. But to actually see it... and then to add on to the shock, later in the night in front of his wife and my fiancé, he offered whiskey in my cider, and on impulse I had accepted. Just as he started pouring whiskey into my drink my heart SANK and i felt nothing but regret and disgust for myself, normalizing his behavior. 

I am just so worried. For years, time and time again, he has been able to get out of trouble because he can afford good lawyers, and truthfully he has never felt real life-affecting consequences as a result of his actions. It’s only a matter of time before he hurts himself, someone else or his family...

I just want to talk to him about it because as I said, I have never talked to him about it, confronted him, nothing. He has so much going for him, a wonderful handsome baby boy and a wife who cares about him very much, but she is starting to lose control and is realizing it and has reached out to me and my fiancé for help, something, anything. I know that it’s not actually my job to do that, but since I have never tried before in my life, I really want to.

Im afraid that he isn’t going to live much longer if he continues to unravel. Whether it be liver cancer, rolling his car drunk, or losing his family and blowing his brains out or something horrible, I truly do not think its going to end well.  

Any advice or tips or anything would be wonderful and much appreciated. Sorry for the rant too, I don’t really get to express this often at all since my family doesn’t really talk about it and I only have my fiancé to about this.",5.103006493506495,5.630869192424242,6.039480519480518,79.75136363636366,68.43939393939394,9.376623376623376,30.259740259740266,9.424239791934726,2.59251948051948,2617,96,513,51,42,867,272,660,0.10300000000000001,0.725,0.172,0.9949,3,0,14,0,0,0,79.0,3,0,0,6,30,34,3,2,22,0,59,23,5,5,11,107,100,60,0,8,27,11,2,0,1,1,6,4,1,3,33,37,14,1,16,10,0,12,19,16,1,2,26,11,77,18,82,69,17,76,0,7,5,2,93,29,0,17,35,372,110,2,0.057115212705628984,0.13534437501494706,0.11147241726442148,0.0,0.0,0.11162464965861964,0.050629189928802346,0.2441551701478979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03884030320392581,0.059890280488987216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400190705043804,0.0,0.053395013892788466,0.0,0.0,0.04391807305894862,0.0476888169051717,0.0696338070822266,0.0,0.1458025178349022,0.0,0.059938892005958234,0.10102752843919993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06375946651441572,0.058321018036053024,0.0,0.05823276588277425,0.05867305655810728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06405956765447543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33570698677766164,0.0,0.0,0.047712431351533184,0.0,0.050587125763908725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16152941824532616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10967912211764708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06262388271326977,0.04412707165595803,0.0,0.08952102388566151,0.0,0.09737967480360682,0.09581106120913792,0.045680253174668166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643729957264648,0.1353636041103953,0.038283123139570274,0.060345358066273835,0.0,0.056728293487155995,0.0,0.0,0.06114301648630235,0.0,0.061694230741787474,0.0,0.05667803558844011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03138902721116023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068432766299241,0.0,0.0,0.05043377921827494,0.0,0.14388718151649665,0.12779462702398528,0.0,0.0,0.10309741878723144,0.0,0.038124847987902465,0.17371758328918924,0.0,0.062215210534786285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045588817870719146,0.0,0.2519175185954352,0.0,0.2643046384785385,0.05516222833851405,0.0,0.05359875803361542,0.05596078174362629,0.10960717399371207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03870274628265715,0.08687738594537109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0596732409240317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500961617037998,0.14635787111132822,0.0,0.11278876423241377,0.12264072734837295,0.0,0.04877607957838687,0.05432964653515808,0.045420309580294825,0.0,0.0,0.04551342979486915,0.051995544549834606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09449258832483788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04839353437960869,0.08794016227523875,0.0,0.06393580453261491,0.12127932457029204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0538304120442775,0.0,0.0,0.13772113346093853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758896188687291,0.07319424418111439,0.11223081298701264,0.0453430990571008,0.0999130195110778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03877748028609486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06870256847421498,0.0,0.0,0.2356301603555505,0.06737606451582942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051353435483656534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2477560472295953,0.0,0.058003270940967015,0.0,0.04057300839057045,0.0,0.0,0.1471212975464785
alcoholism,askingquestions5505,2020/01/16,I'm 23 and got drunk almost everyday for 6 years straight I can't rationalize a good reason to fully quit alcohol even though I know it has a negative effect on my mood/body. I've never done anything crazy bad while drinking but I've used it as a way to kill time for years of living alone (4 years). I pretty much just play games and get drunk every night and have around 1-2 off days per week. When I have taken a week or 2 off of drinking before I've noticed I felt incredible. But there hits a point where its like ok this is pointless I want to get drunk because I'm bored or sick of the day or just want to have fun. Not sure what I'm really asking besides what is your opinion/advice on this?,4.327424924924923,4.290495871621626,5.334144144144143,86.1087537537538,70.01351351351353,8.1993993993994,25.903903903903903,7.793537801064563,1.190321921921922,551,14,122,6,9,182,100,148,0.203,0.65,0.147,-0.8758,0,1,3,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,0,2,8,9,1,0,6,1,8,7,0,3,2,22,22,12,1,2,8,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,7,4,6,0,4,7,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,1,8,6,15,17,1,22,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,4,14,64,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15034309267997215,0.0,0.16442176296230496,0.15406127030534786,0.15934501340761068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12660767551790314,0.1369615352077835,0.1438315201325608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12846059076914307,0.09378718718347248,0.0,0.13091732885681254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17089568298775254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19844454678731815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574447441828463,0.0,0.30143417713311965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10161826737748143,0.0,0.1296275481786308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14772273393037325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1607633873224132,0.0,0.0,0.1290443580265212,0.12305007106740612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17021523420500378,0.0,0.08455342868397024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075164665251368,0.0,0.13585476624389753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11309944820053013,0.0,0.11866069868991228,0.0,0.0,0.14438035095695356,0.0,0.0,0.17516233599687986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454405454669114,0.0,0.0,0.15652352241932802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16364130073215752,0.0,0.0,0.0985619889882212,0.15818621537064598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14500436331446007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15115951154210072,0.0,0.0897127554904112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13287934799274684,0.0,0.0,0.1814926352359293,0.12212112408022342,0.2468227357794047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29722831300980457

alcoholism,mulepacker2010,2020/01/16,"Moment of Clarity Sooo i just wrote a really long fucking inspirational post and accidently hit back and lost it.  So long story short:

I had a moment of clariry today.  Day 4 no alcohal after I went on a bender that resulted in such a bad hangover i puked so much i lost my voice (not the first time thats happened im a puker). I started off just a 3 day break get it out of my system then drink moderately ( lie ive told myself  many times).  But I was out for coffee today and normally when im out i look at people and wish I could be living  a normal fulfilling life like them. But today when I had that thought I stopped and thought I am I am like them!  I have an amazing life its just my addictions that are pulling me down and making me feel that way. 

 So on the way home i cried! (I dont usually express emotion like that unless im drinking) I cried for the younger me the experiences she missed out on and the insecirities and anger she felt.  How she couldnt deal with her emotions how she was numb througout her whole college experience! But i cried happy because i know if i had smartened up and sobered up at 15 when it was first a problem (im 27) 12 of the fucking prime years of life numbed but I'm still happy cause I wouldnt be where im at today.  I would have continued with engineering.  I wouldnt have my amazing job at Sequoia National Park and my amazing Nigerian boyfriend. (Bragging i know lol). But now i like where i am i think i wanna stay so i wanna try and quit for good! 

 He has expressed his concerns about weed and alcohal use and i know i will eventually lose him if i dont quit! And as i work in trails alcohal is prevelant and forgiven often but im still on a path to making huge mistakes at work if i dont sober up. I cry happy knowing something is different this time at least i fucking pray it is! Its only day 4 and i am taking it day by day but i feel so good about it today i just wanted to share! After i accidently deleted my first post (which was much better i promise) I almost just said fuck it. But i wanted to share this feeling. Because  I think  Its really because of others sharing their stories on this page and the one for quitting weed that i feel stronger this time.  

I hate the labels of addict and alcohalic.  I was terrified of going to AA (im not religious) or even other groups cause i thought going in ment this is it no more and that thought terrified me.  ( ive known ive had a problem for a while but only really tried to stop and moderate in the last 2 years).  Combing through this page reading all the scary,sad, inspirational stories has given me that sense of community and higher power i was too scared to seek elsewhere. So thank you guys!

alcoholism,malicea21,2020/01/16,"I'm an alcoholic and I need to quit, but I also have to do it alone. Please help. The title pretty much says it. I drink alot, like 200 ounces a day of anywhere from 6-14% beer for a long time. It's destroying my life and I just can't seem to stop. I'm watching everything fall apart down my nose over a beer can and I just keep chugging. I need help, but I'm viewed in such a way that I cannot ask for help or go-to a hospital or anything, I have to solo it. I've read about all the symptoms and I'm ready to deal with it, but is there any advice from anyone else that has done it alone? I can't keep doing this to everyone that loves me. I will lose them all.

alcoholism,murb98,2020/01/16,Purposely getting blacked out I’m a bartender &amp; I drink about 6 days a week. I write it off because I see sooooooo many people do it everyday. But I’m also getting black out drunk for almost 2 weeks now. Maybe 5 times... I do it on purpose. Right before my last shot I know it’s gonna be the one I black out at. I can’t remember shit &amp; I just hope I didn’t make a fool of myself around the people I see all the time. I havnt tried to stop because I already tell myself I can’t. I think I just wanna forget. I like still doing things but not being there mentally.

alcoholism,-worldexploder-,2020/01/16,"Energy + mental acuity = my desire to drink. Been having alcohol issues since my divorce in 2014....use to drunk cuz it hurt so bad. Now I drink because I’m addicted.

I have to admit, I’ve been doing “better” these past couple months. I went 12 days without drinking, then 10, then 10 again.......problem is, I just can’t calm down. My mind races and I cannot sit still. I alternate between sleeping a lot to barley sleeping at all. 

During my “sober” times, I get a lot done. I invented a new sport that my uncle, who is a sports fan, believes is “genius”. It’s called Lawball. I’ll have to send y’all my draft at some point. 

I also get real depressed for like 3 days after I drink. I got someone from Michigan who still wants to come down to f me ffs...yet I cannot get it together. I may have an “IQ” of 127...but that don’t mean crap if you got a malfunctioning prefrontal cortex with shrunken amygdala’s. I’m the kind of man who “wants candy and wants candy now”. I try so hard to use my intellect to counteract the addictive part of my brain.

alcoholism,Shoowopp,2020/01/16,"How do I continue to hold on to a reason to stay sober? 5 days from now I will have been completely free of alcohol for 11 months. Prior to my sobriety, I drank until I blacked out every night for just around 4 years  

Last February I spent 1.5 months in the ICU with life-threatening pancreatitis, severe liver and stomach damage, and a long list of other health problems directly caused by years of alcohol abuse. I have yet to fully recover and likely never will. This was a serious turning point in my life and I have been able to successfully stay sober, although, I will add, it has been incredibly difficult. 

As I near 11 months and soon a full year of sobriety, I am ashamed to say that I have found myself thinking more often about drinking again. The doctors and surgeons who essentially brought me back to life all warned me that if I ever drink again I would almost certainly die. Even though I know this information, I can't help but think more and more about drinking.

I want to believe that I am strong enough to abstain from drinking, but as the 11 and 12 month anniversary of my sobriety approach I feel immense shame and I've been beating myself up over it. 

Is it common to feel like complete shit around anniversaries? I don't know how to talk about this with others. I hid my drinking from everyone around me, and I've continued to hide my past as well as my struggles with sobriety. If anybody has tips on sobriety in the long term, I would greatly appreciate it. All I feel is despair when I think about how much I have fucked up my life.",6.392913415087326,6.7830232541806055,6.516426978818284,77.92923727238944,65.62207357859532,10.122705314009664,33.333519137866965,9.994966539143718,3.1947523597175778,1239,50,234,26,18,396,163,299,0.157,0.774,0.068,-0.9757,0,0,7,0,1,0,27.0,0,0,0,3,23,18,2,3,8,0,24,18,3,5,5,51,39,25,1,6,5,0,3,2,0,5,8,1,0,0,13,18,8,2,11,5,2,2,3,10,1,0,9,5,36,9,49,25,9,47,0,2,1,1,5,15,2,4,30,170,49,2,0.0942866743139835,0.11171429119099018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20152756086594492,0.09441448464356783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518053902256941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07250063257837988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10622879432645632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09685838698023408,0.0,0.0,0.197715568278328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06080710479056935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09785468199181543,0.0,0.0,0.09650640642884042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4618252275794965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09742333898310084,0.0,0.06227545914558224,0.08528769493097467,0.07944058966044923,0.09009495787367147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14302252659218798,0.06735841896927815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10338047175093933,0.0,0.08716651108804903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395139129236776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10022232575210142,0.0,0.0,0.06319837031486789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10363498078681757,0.07685622384068108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663898658247855,0.09212741293186467,0.0,0.0,0.16688147947853238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.301034895560312,0.0,0.06931155438456929,0.0,0.07271969582003933,0.0,0.0,0.08848165668918959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000729939227572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913138337313305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021961362497508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09694240461820687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07498054780448184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1065171043399621,0.09678391624738657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200994099155004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0985689038247628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578405729783444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18124528131406475,0.09263617879389564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255682655351184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055612723393883665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08477504358264412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339570964316207,0.0,0.0,0.18215258084447744

alcoholism,gracieboo00,2020/01/16,"How can I support the ones I love dealing with alcoholism? Hope this makes sense. 
My (F19) partner (M20) and I have been together for nearly 2 1/2 years. Since we started dating his dad has sunken into a deep depression that involves intense alcoholism. 
My partner and his brothers (20 &amp; 17) have tried so much to help him. Every time we go over to his house for dinner he gets drunk and goes into a deep depressive zone that my bf has to deal with. We rarely actually have dinner. 

My bf isn’t a talker, so I’m kept in the dark about quite a lot of the day to day details of his dad’s life, but I know it’s not going well. 
People his dads age are having a go at my bf and his brothers for not doing enough, and for not loving their father endlessly, despite having no idea how much time, effort and stress the boys put into helping their dad. 

Basically i guess I’m trying to ask, how can I support my bf and his brothers through all this? I’m a talker when it comes to emotions and stress, so to have my bf be the complete opposite has me at a loss. I’m worried about their dad and them, but eometimes my bf will snap at me or crack it at me for asking how they’re all doing, which is understandable because he’s stressed about it, but it means I don’t know how else to help him.

What kind of external support helped you through it all, whether being the child of an alcoholic or a former alcoholic yourself.

alcoholism,decanderus,2020/01/17,"Day 36 I decided one night while i was tipsy that I'd had enough. I got myself into treatment Dec. 12th and was there through New Year's Eve.

Since then I've gone to a few meetings (my favorite being SMART) and have been pretty good at keeping myself distracted with video games.  No real cravings except a coupe of times; it kind of reminds me of when i went vegetarian a few years back and would crave meat in the beginning.

My biggest concerns are with my new prescribed medication (2400mg of Gabapentin for anxiety seems like a lot) and how to deal with boredom. I just have so much free time on my hands. I'm volunteering at a library event tomorrow to try something new but that leaves the rest of the day...

Something I learned in treatment was how amazing it is to have a group surrounding you that understands what I'm going through. I just don't have that at home.

I'm just rambling.

alcoholism,VicturnUp,2020/01/17,"Does that make me an alcoholic? Alright I don't feel the *need* to drink and I'm not angry, nervous or anything when I can't. But the the thing is whenever I go out, I drink a lot and I can't stop. 
It ruins my health, my body -I started hitting the gym 6-7 months ago and progress is slowed by alcohol-, my bank account...

Yesterday I went out again. I was supposed to wake up at 5 and go to work. Obviously I didn't, because I wasn't even at home when 5 stroke on the clock. 

During this evening I paid a lot, I tripped over my feet, hurted my left leg, and broke my phone's screen. 
I woke up with a terrible feeling that I made mistakes and that I've been making a lot because of alcohol. 

I don't even know where to start in order to quit.

alcoholism,Harleyquinnito,2020/01/17,"I dont know what to do anymore I'm an alcoholic. Obviously. I use to drink 2-3 handles a week. I went through horrible withdrawal and tried to straighten up with the help of my doctors. I did get better but I wasnt clean. I went from handles to a fifth a week. Then I got down to a fifth maybe every other week, if that. Holidays came around and my alcoholic brain made it an excuse to drink and I fell back in the rabbit hole. 

The worst thing about my addiction is i have really bad anxiety. I was diagnosed long before i had an addiction. When i couldnt see my dr anymore, i used alcohol to dilute the world and make things easier. It worked for a while. But then, my hangovers werent just headaches and nausea. They were severe anxiety that landed me in the hospital with gastritis, withdrawal, hallucinations, nightmares and panic attacks.

I continue to drink through the typical holiday events and it lead to my rabbit hole. I had a few drinks and I was fine the next day but was slightly hungover. I'm sure most of you know the ""hair of the dog"" trick. So I tried. I took 3 shots and cut myself off. That night I fell back again. I was afraid to go to sleep. I felt like when I started to drift, I was dying. Like my heart would stop or I'd forget to breathe. Its almost like restless leg syndrome but its your whole body and your brain. 

I have successfully gone a couple weeks without alcohol. But I had so much stress at the time, tonight I decided I'd drink a little. I only bought a fifth and I have no intention of drinking all of it or even drinking again anytime soon. 

My fiance got mad and went to stay elsewhere. Understandable. Hes the one that's had to take me to the hospital and hold me at night while I cry and thrash because not only am I angry at myself, but he doesnt want to watch me kill myself. 

I just dont know how to stop. I do so well for long periods of time but I always go back. Even when I'm literally afraid I wont wake up. I'm scared. I dont want to lose him. But I also dont k ow how to give it up. I'm trying so hard. But it's like being hungry for days. The thirst is here.

alcoholism,wingdealing,2020/01/17,"Standing on the precipice, or have I passed it already? I know I have a propensity for substance abuse. I have since I was a child. I don’t think I’m an alcoholic, but yet I can’t rationalize my way out of it. If I have unstructured free time, I drink. If I have something to celebrate, I drink. If I have something to lament, I drink. This is nothing new. 

I am too fearful to use the drugs that kill me fast. I turn to the drugs that slowly dull my mind and erode my being slowly and deliberately. Alcohol fits me. It makes me feel confident enough to breathe without fear. It gives me respite from the depression and anxiety. Were they incidental to the substance abuse, or are they the instigators? 

I don’t think I’m an alcoholic, but what if I’m too afraid to see the truth?

alcoholism,cash77cash,2020/01/17,"Help with Ex-wife and children. I (43M) share custody with my ex-wife(40F). Ex has the gene, father is an alcoholic, I watched her mother almost drink herself to death a few times, and her sister is 6 years sober. We've been divorced for over 3 years a d had no idea her alcoholism kicked in until last June when she suddenly checked into rehab for 10 days.

I never once thought about getting full custody with the kids because:
   1. I don't want our daughters (7 and 10) to not be able to see their mom regularly
    2. I feel it would only hurt my ex mentally and cause her to drink more often

Since she got out of rehab she has relapsed twice (that I know of), the second time was on the last day of school before Xmas break. She called me that day and said she had broken up with her boyfriend and was in bad way(she was sobbing). She was on her way to pick up our girls. I told her to stop by my place and I'd cook dinner.

When she arrived she reaked of beer. Halfway through dinner I went out to her car and there was an open container. She picked are kids up from school drunk.

I waited for the kids to go to bed to talk with her. I told her that was strike 2 and strike 3 was me getting full custody. I felt like she knew the gravity of the situation.

A week passed and she started out patience rehab, 3X a week. Last Friday she calls me at 2PM, sobbing, and I eventually got her to admit she was drunk. She was scheduled to pick up the girls that day.


What do I need to do here? She has no freinds or family near us. She has a great job and makes twice as much as I do. This allows our kids to live a good life.",2.2780320619126577,3.6665331194029886,3.232769485903816,93.98416804864569,76.01492537313433,6.156992813709231,22.85516860143725,6.605766666666668,0.3405035931453839,1245,35,286,10,27,397,182,335,0.096,0.855,0.049,-0.9173,1,0,5,0,1,0,43.0,4,0,1,0,6,8,0,0,16,0,25,14,0,6,1,46,46,18,1,3,2,7,2,1,0,1,6,1,1,7,7,22,10,3,7,6,1,4,5,4,0,3,21,5,53,4,49,23,5,47,0,3,2,0,57,19,2,3,23,180,60,3,0.1147060309113265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24517172542530705,0.11486152070585745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957747445368456,0.06992373178065772,0.0,0.09760638380715947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23425536492711754,0.0,0.0,0.11783469097634948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2959036021785265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22473648250209885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10813463736787653,0.0,0.057998815759363526,0.0,0.11013577798261508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1198583336686674,0.0,0.06519008076842653,0.0962099765376453,0.18348178303026086,0.1264638040275997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768850346205028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12279517849713495,0.12948914683281834,0.0,0.0,0.11382803624856565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06303943476699975,0.2805021744082088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08102026189301646,0.056039572677852686,0.0,0.10128752680660708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07656716634023789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11559670001221875,0.0,0.0,0.13434231706167216,0.0,0.0,0.08432213096489898,0.08505306848590842,0.08846836244131473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12215817932069475,0.0,0.08723910535977783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1198433883681644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10911170281344494,0.0,0.0,0.23217725428996824,0.09140585559644124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09488601410926617,0.12893438473862828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08118951906773794,0.0,0.0,0.0958993780379342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09219636265929797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910637757556061,0.13377201813171985,0.0,0.0,0.21921305630947124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379772318052517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06765658896228344,0.18209661642230734,0.18402051807188274,0.0,0.0,0.10633363984534758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08148387328260114,0.0,0.0,0.1477338462438891

alcoholism,ashbart90,2020/01/18,"Eye opening blackout I’ve been 12 days sober since I had an experience that scared me. I was watching the Patriots vs Titans game at a bar alone because I couldn’t get it to stream on my tv. I’m a 29 year old female and I am fairly sociable. I ended up making some new acquaintances and having several drinks with my new found fellow Patriots fans. I remember being at the 1st bar after the game and then things get really hazy. I know I walked next door to the other bar and then the night is lost. I have about 8-10 hours of unaccounted time. I know there was another bar after that because of transactions on my bank card. I have no receipt for an Uber or Lyft. I woke up the next morning in my apartment with no memory of getting there, with an opened condom wrapper on my night stand. There was a condom in my trash can but it looked like it had been put on but not really used if you know what I mean. Physically it did not feel like I had intercourse in that blackout period. I also woke up with a big bruise on my knee, bloody knee cap, and an extremely painful elbow, meaning I had a pretty hard fall that I obviously don’t remember.

The blackout I experienced was slightly terrifying and I know I am lucky because that stranger could have done whatever they wanted to me and I would have woken up with no idea who they were. I still don’t know who this guy was, but I’m glad he made the decision to not completely take advantage of me. 

This experience has motivated me to reevaluate my relationship with alcohol. I work in sector of health care (radiology) where we are constantly treating people for horrible alcohol related pathology. 

Sorry if I’m ranting but it’s just good to get this out.

alcoholism,hopper215,2020/01/18,"Am I addicted to alcohol? All,

I have been drinking almost every night since I started college. I have graduated almost 5 years ago and can barely remember almost any nights I’ve been without alcohol in YEARS. I do not wake up and drink and typically will only drink after like 6 or 7.  I black out a few nights a week and don’t remember going to bed (i don’t do anything irresponsible like drink and Drive or start fights). I end up drinking a lot because work has always been so demanding ( construction sales). I always tell myself I’m going to have a few drinks so that I can sleep, but I and starting to think that is just a lie I tell myself. Do you think I am physically addicted to alcohol at this point in my life?  I just turned 27, is it possibly to be an alcoholic at this age?  Again, I don’t drink throughout the day, only at night. Successful career and have a family, but I am afraid that the alcoholism (if that is the case) is going to destroy my self, family, and career.

alcoholism,throwaway5t0p,2020/01/18,"How to help a friend I used to binge drink with?  

Me and my friend used to binge drink together years ago in our early 20's. Since then I seemed to learn moderation, and moved on/moved to another state 500 miles away. We still talk on the phone several times a week so were still pretty close.

My friend still lives at home with his parents. His dads an alcoholic too so I think they're far to desensitized to the whole thing. He will go through short 3 day burst of not drinking(probably cause hes broke) and then go right back to drinking 7+% IPAs. Like multiple days in a row. Like drinking through hangovers which blows my mind. Getting wasted and driving all over town.

I'm afraid he's going to get a DUI or diabetes or something since hes a heavier dude, and his dad has that as well. Almost more than that I'm afraid that the drinking is emotionally stunting him, and hes never going to grow up, and move out of his parents house, and get a girlfriend. Generally just never mature into an adult.

How can I bring my concerns up to him without seeming like I'm judging him, or how can i help give him the tools to help himself. Any time I seem to approach the topic he starts to get really defensive. So I just back off, but I think It's getting to a point that I need to do something. Any advice?",4.335172413793103,5.272590965517246,4.7132758620689685,87.09681034482759,70.3793103448276,7.7923371647509585,27.526819923371647,7.984000788550335,1.4965647509578544,1026,34,216,13,18,324,152,261,0.022000000000000002,0.894,0.084,0.8851,2,0,9,0,0,0,29.0,2,0,0,0,15,11,1,2,14,0,10,7,0,6,3,42,33,21,0,1,8,4,0,3,4,1,2,0,1,1,7,14,6,1,6,5,0,10,4,4,1,0,1,0,28,7,36,31,3,47,0,1,0,0,32,18,0,7,21,127,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09179692806133392,0.08327200344926669,0.10039312400269028,0.09406718390023976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12776463012409028,0.09850411690310974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08825957548265614,0.1444678825157109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965020964182214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12116685549615655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4601264178530914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566968022430487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2177330706836315,0.0,0.2453984555902688,0.09011565798463103,0.2135527121156196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18889769122970493,0.0,0.09422932263480817,0.0,0.0,0.10839396704454116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13768278766597242,0.0,0.08295060305980866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948524629149348,0.0,0.0,0.19968637439256404,0.0,0.06965520380869931,0.1449043973643966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2086181588334287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08880351635340393,0.0,0.0,0.09557059304359856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06018026935226808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08022411325571091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2565579167584412,0.0,0.10612528448674703,0.0,0.15541601894048265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14463896235769738,0.0,0.0,0.06649110488859705,0.0,0.22506144161825786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07550528800166853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06240945799337455,0.12038571745839514,0.0,0.0,0.10955415663115972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16226772685183788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535287626573466,0.0,0.08446320122325328,0.0,0.0,0.1048804807247788,0.0,0.09055465709202344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060494179414973474
alcoholism,mbirdybird,2020/01/18,"Middle aged females in recovery ..... My best friend is an alcoholic.  She has been having difficulty lately and had started drinking again.   She likes to believe that those closest things her can not recognize it.  I am not sure what to do.  I am afraid if I address it in anyway she will withdraw from me.  On the other hand, how can I watch her drown and not do anything.  Will she be able to pull herself out of this? Who knows?  Like all relationships it is somewhat complex.   I just don’t know how to handle this best.

alcoholism,PartyCabinet,2020/01/18,"Anti-alcohol pellets Hi everyone! I’m not an alcoholic but I recently saw a story about former footballer Paul Gascoigne saying he spent £20k on getting anti-alcohol pellets sewn into his stomach. I was wondering if this community could shed some light on how successful is this treatment actually and is it worth it for someone to get? Thanks!

Also I do hope I’m not infringing on your rules with this post!

alcoholism,cludo88,2020/01/18,"Mother is alcoholic, don't know what to do My mother has binge drunk most her life, shes 57, the thing is drink seems to affect her abnormaly, she changes into a completely different person, an evil horrible person with the mentality of an infant, it's literally like the exorcist, and I hate the person she is while shes drunk.

New year's eve she took an overdose and shes drinking every day now, it's hard to be there for her because I hate her when shes drunk, any sympathy I feel for her is insincere when shes drunk and it's just hard to maintain, she has done unforgivable things while drunk but I quickly forgave her for all of them, for example boxing day she told me her now ex bf gave her a black eye, after seeing the 'black eye' I immediately payed him a visit and attacked him. Turns out she just had a rash around her eyes and she was lying.

On top of the drink she is severely depressed, she still dwells on things that happened 30 years ago, shes never changed, theres been no personal growth her whole life, shes just stuck in the same destructive loop.

She has no drive to do anything about it.

I am the only person in the world who she trusts, I don't want to abandon her, but I have ambitions, strict routines to follow to get where i want to go.

She ruined my mental health as a child, i was going down the same road as her but iv broke her legacy, my life is dedicated to personal growth.

I don't want to sacrifice my own life for hers because shes not doing anything about her issues, nothing, no effort.

She says she has an alcoholics meeting Tuesday but I am 90 percent sure she won't go.

Her mom, dad and sister are all dead and before they died they all became victims of endless depression, also alcoholism aside from her sister.

I just don't know what to do, I have started having reaccuring horrible nightmares involving her when shes drunk.

Her sense of dread and hopelessness is infectious, the more I'm there with her, the more she drags me down.

Any advice is appreciated.",4.749987872002984,5.691556143576831,5.511195074167368,81.73895232764252,69.42821158690177,8.803395839164102,28.053829648288087,9.049649993220411,2.142099057747925,1587,53,314,29,27,517,198,397,0.24100000000000002,0.6829999999999999,0.075,-0.9969,1,0,6,0,0,1,41.0,0,0,3,2,19,18,6,2,21,0,42,22,4,1,5,39,65,20,2,3,9,7,3,1,1,1,9,1,0,8,11,13,12,1,4,9,1,9,10,15,0,0,9,10,70,3,39,54,11,42,1,6,6,0,73,13,0,2,21,219,81,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0885048011510231,0.08028560718067196,0.2903781313090815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07242948810065787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12318258815492555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490642096841472,0.08062727208031234,0.0,0.10303743428948134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11042231743703876,0.0,0.07706913534338129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19162393202203748,0.0,0.0949618288778614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11682143050165003,0.0,0.15601710679715425,0.0,0.0939982586816143,0.09462727700683436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09268544053326368,0.0,0.2661749013379479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630986013880707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0457953507461707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047319538841808416,0.0,0.15442052953362154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009151689586347,0.0,0.16226741040307968,0.17883995669053615,0.0,0.0962725943200857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09453245211822237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995507576559105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25589152208427873,0.04424834977830505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18254825905836825,0.0,0.0,0.1060755025657452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06985383468429325,0.08747390589943088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690518777623762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06888322419045556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.474497915561826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0720255871783869,0.0,0.0,0.07217325323779666,0.08245231398613254,0.0,0.1023192975947916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06410652448571261,0.0,0.07233000986655261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08536196849758307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18051377490397733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08654434293523985,0.10062756366394153,0.0,0.09851509315362916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16026312854415795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101119136415635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11664933528797965

alcoholism,Pikachu11778,2020/01/18,"Im 15 years old i've been drinking since 13 and i could use some advice... In my country under age drinking is really common because in supermarkets you can get alcohol quite easily since no one cares enough to ask for id. At the age of 13 i became really depressed because of some times in my childhood when i used to get rejected by some of the other kids and that kind of pushed me into becoming an introvert i think... When i was 14 i considered suicide and almost went through with it but thankfully i drank a bit before i wanted to ""do it"" and felt numb enough to not give a shit... But that feeling also made me decide to continue eitherway and if it didnt get any better in a years time i would try again... Things did get better and alcohol did make me open up to more people and made me realise i wasn't the only one eith such problems.im 15 now and i still drink, if any of you have been in a similar situation in the past it would really help if you could give me some advice on how you handled the situation",4.159244505494506,4.879093028846154,5.805247252747255,79.90403846153846,70.63461538461539,9.404395604395603,27.357142857142854,9.606745405546679,2.358056593406593,802,26,162,18,14,275,121,208,0.08800000000000001,0.848,0.064,-0.6073,0,2,5,0,0,1,17.0,0,4,0,3,9,9,1,0,10,0,15,8,1,6,0,37,35,17,1,8,6,0,2,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,8,11,6,0,4,3,0,2,4,4,0,2,12,2,22,5,26,19,8,30,0,2,0,0,9,12,1,8,16,113,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2071657763606916,0.0,0.2265655280032504,0.10614462593855313,0.0,0.0,0.08476891049207676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1441685432730871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990965664010508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12923437385253322,0.11706970611424497,0.0901989894854096,0.0,0.0,0.18749842823173,0.1157255684788212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807501918823494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1692662445817265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912984511428614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3115216878986741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2190546061461894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05359725838404959,0.0,0.10177752205069017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22152445683631292,0.2033715140899603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105019322323672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2289984021931684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11038366333202453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2006012979160645,0.07075644811609284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11123015140951834,0.0,0.1436579555762735,0.0806184886698564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10118988799017226,0.07348770249388342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11274504370817327,0.0,0.0,0.20372074238085866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10880843787613656,0.1753701398437906,0.23829898741713734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08465248468618042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11594781970515587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09759142050470113,0.0,0.0,0.07042231200160018,0.06792111987490426,0.0,0.0,0.12361999683078073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0719676776890105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831015499183424,0.0,0.0,0.0625220986414626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09826392996287113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15060004771754856,0.0,0.0,0.13652225524837286

alcoholism,georgecostanzaisdad,2020/01/19,"I did a very hard thing today I’m 22, and until September of this past year, I had a pretty good relationship with my father. 

Now I’m not an idiot and have been well aware of his occasional blackouts, as at times I have witnessed and attempted to control them. 

What I was not aware of, was that he had been sexually abusing my 18 year old sister for years now during these blackouts. 

He claims he has never consciously thought of or done anything of the sexual nature to my sister, and I believe him. I think my whole family (me, mom, sister, and 15 y/o brother) believes him. 

The issue of course is not the intent, but the act itself. And for that reason he has not been allowed in the house nor has he been able to see any of us face-to-face. 

My whole life I have been trying to get him to stop drinking. It made him loud and hard to deal with and I noticed this since I was a kid. 

Since I last saw him, I have been texting him every now and again just to let him know that I am thinking of him. 

In the midst of these short exchanges, I’ve been building up the courage to deliver the following ultimatum:

Quit drinking, or I cut you off. 

Forever. 

Today, I put it out there with him. 

I’m awaiting a response, but I must say,

I am feeling more powerful about this than I ever have about anything.",3.5072503502101284,4.552700889733842,4.749105463277967,85.66815289173505,72.42205323193916,7.5140284170502305,26.769861917150287,7.85451343220497,1.461567300380228,1006,34,210,13,19,333,145,263,0.043,0.887,0.07,0.7785,2,0,2,0,0,0,35.0,1,1,1,4,10,5,2,0,13,0,27,3,0,5,3,37,40,16,0,1,9,6,3,0,0,1,1,2,0,1,13,13,2,2,7,2,1,3,6,2,1,0,17,7,36,3,33,21,3,27,0,0,2,0,28,7,0,2,17,152,49,0,0.12434738783690298,0.14733132115139794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845604877827143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2046546102113584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2801938488904665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394661689320878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281966967843697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272505502480814,0.0,0.2436262010703956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11247933132078364,0.10476803731145196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11722365061851747,0.0,0.06287377551129719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06496637789561521,0.0,0.0,0.1042966892957378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2227816703715466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434801903639154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12978636643612898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06833807239003012,0.10135971751184818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12715362885651496,0.08783023741834972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11766050496533377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14563415776708225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09590437127312024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415703252212514,0.13048166605273395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11870365189053718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265059971230049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250034697550646,0.0,0.13225875318705962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278498247245354,0.0,0.13350255882602216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888603374660096,0.0,0.0,0.09908876879543654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2057228883782729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395998413910143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08261087916192401,0.15935357039685874,0.0,0.0987179362044946,0.07250796182290213,0.0,0.2357335682219119,0.0,0.0,0.08442371396434765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495745970777526,0.0,0.0,0.10259961767739548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11180323518631097,0.0,0.0,0.2776588356373487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2402269226331366
alcoholism,alpha249,2020/01/19,"I'm in my 5 years of recovery but I have relapsed every year I did try to I've been into detox and everything nothing seems to work, My girlfriend of 3 years have seem to lost hope on me, my family too. I dont know what to do. Heya, by the time im writing this I am currently buzzed by alcohol, but yeah as the title suggests. I have been through every outpatient method that I could think of. I have been with valiums,  quetiapines, and other anti psychotic, anti-drinking drugs that my Doctors have given me.  It didn't work. I have been 5 years in this hellhole yet I keep going back to my tendencies of drinking.   


Yes before you ask I have tried multiple times of hanging myself yet I couldnt do it. The scars have healed now around my neck. I've graduated College with a degree in Political Science, I am currently studying Law in my country. Before I came into law It was great the medication was working, everything was great until I failed a subject or two then it all became downhill from there. I want to stop this hellish nightmare of mine.   


Oh before you ask me, I never attended any therapy for this only a doctor. my parents didnt allow me back then because ""It would ruin their reputation within their families"" if it ever comes out that I am an alcoholic.   


There are numerous factors for my alcoholism. First is my first ex-gf didnt gave me closure and her family treated me like shit. 2nd was my family was battling my brother who is now esteemed af in the family because he recovered for some reason which is good for him and he now has a child. 3rd was to fill a gaping hole in myself in my recovery days when my ex broke up with me which started the whole alcohol stuff also the smoking cigarettes.   


My girlfriend and I just had a fight on my condition, she's a psych major which she understood my condition for 3 years until just now. Where I had to constantly lie to her that I was not drinking. Which is a fault on my part tbh. Then she got fed up, I am in a sinking hole atm. On which I may or may not recover on.   


Also note: I have never been part of the AA of my country because my parents being boomers dont like the idea of it of me becoming a part of it so I had to deal with a Psychiatrist only. not with the people I can relate to I guess. Also, I have been detoxed so many times that I feel like I am a burden to my family in which I have planned and did many suicide attempts on which have failed. Its not like in america here where I could buy a gun and kill myself.   


I tried so hard but didnt got so far. (Linkin Park Reference lmao) its been 5 years now I don't know where to go anymore. My gf hates me for lying to her so many times (which I understand) my family who gives a fuck but doesnt understand what Im going through even though the doctors explained to them what im going through. And my Brother who I love so much is trying to bury that his actions before (he was an alcoholic too and recovered by his own will) is trying to deny that Im not an alcoholic by his means. (tbh he was a father figure to me because my dad wasnt around home all the the time). So yeah. I dont know what the fuck am I suppose to do anymore.

alcoholism,xxxferma,2020/01/19,"Am I alcoholic? So a lot of people are in denial of their alcoholism. To me that is the exact opposite : I always knew I had a problem with alcohol and accepted it, until I recently wondered...do I really?

I started drinking on an almost daily basis when I moved to Belgium for my studies something like 8 years ago ( I guess that's part of the culture there ). I'm rarely very drunk as I'm resistant but I'm tipsy almost every evening. I never drunk before 6pm, and if I have a bit more work to do usually not before 8pm. I never ever drink during the day.

But I drink everyday and I thought surely that's a problematic consumption? Up until recently I had to move for a week in a alternative school where they're fine with guest consuming alcohol but it's just not in their customs to drink themselves. I could have bought some and continue drinking but I was like...no, let's stop for a week to see what happens. 

And what happened was....nothing. absolutely nothing.  Did not crave it , didn't feel anything about it. I was feeling a bit more awake in the morning and that's all. So u started reading this sub and other alcohol related one's on Reddit. I do not recognize myself in the stories shared here. At all. I mean, did I often get in fights because of alcohol? Not. Not often,  not ever. Alcohol does not make me a tiny bit violent.  Does it ruins my sentimental life? No. Actually I'm mostly meeting girls in bars as my work involve working alone so I would say it's actually helping it. Do I get myself in embarassi g situation because of it? It happened at some point in my life , like anyone else. But I can't remember the last time. Not once in the past 5 to 8 years for sure. Maybe it's linked to my anxiety or the fact I'm slightly overweight but hard to say because I've always been anxious and slightly overweight,  which have been living ked by my doctors to other things I won't discus here. 

Sooooo. Yeah.  I always thought I had a problematic consumption because I'm drinking almost everyday and I've been told that's what a problematic consumption is. But actually now that I'm thinking about it....do I really have a problem with alcohol?",2.165545073375263,4.6339108584905695,4.393157232704404,80.34785953878408,80.74528301886792,7.448134171907758,28.054297693920326,8.447377352677275,2.4982964989517806,1700,79,311,39,45,586,200,424,0.12300000000000001,0.795,0.08199999999999999,-0.9622,0,1,15,0,1,0,58.0,0,0,2,3,17,12,2,0,21,1,27,22,0,1,10,67,53,26,0,5,19,0,3,2,1,2,13,2,0,1,24,12,19,1,10,10,1,2,15,5,0,1,16,6,39,7,44,33,12,45,0,1,1,0,13,17,0,12,28,210,63,6,0.0,0.0,0.18729627853232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0567115410937761,0.5469736325851561,0.1921904629777904,0.06626063305703697,0.0,0.0,0.15970137800375986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04894204930028353,0.07227553298781396,0.0,0.04473404087913637,0.06555175507841549,0.05264742554720888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559985659424193,0.0,0.10887902799943372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2095381691503449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05108024016764047,0.0,0.0,0.041259720074228776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06548292881790442,0.11197299450747712,0.0,0.0,0.3760372347035785,0.0,0.0,0.05344437695095575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042256049201660005,0.11574129144112755,0.0539031829127663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06469714826720732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06685043722785211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07047761828158647,0.0,0.16972332319096284,0.0,0.05731061417114305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04288227629517573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052149601474210855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06542057568473253,0.09037736077385687,0.09376744580645976,0.0,0.05649265466569335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05439075686915548,0.0,0.0,0.042704986716168916,0.0,0.06427325843701198,0.06968945135924927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13599435053980055,0.0,0.0,0.09868564878238446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227748609222931,0.0,0.0,0.06813316561801655,0.04335231097589126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06928060085446164,0.06107306030032459,0.04435343268862152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0604787210387723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12243424567547788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06399407695867539,0.0,0.08197030639439287,0.0,0.12633867234845697,0.0,0.07247320201670449,0.0,0.0,0.10175378104517327,0.0,0.064747900661429,0.05098119775884539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07191256318737403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04925243850117746,0.0,0.0,0.09056616560348783,0.0,0.0,0.05348743934182425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205946857548767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04250331918323411,0.04099372706281165,0.0,0.10158080858540657,0.03730536553961529,0.0,0.0,0.06113253960651715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07046136690831514,0.05278753043739626,0.0,0.0,0.10263660202391994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397275383188125,0.0,0.0,0.04544725751835446,0.0,0.0,0.08239787683063712
alcoholism,beyondunoriginal,2020/01/19,"I agreed to marry an alcoholic only to realize I don't want to marry an alcoholic. I'm overwhelmed with my fiancé's alcoholism and don't know what step I can take in order for him to take action.

I'm more so seeking advice from someone on his end of things so I can figure out how to approach him without it turning into a fight. 

How were you emotionally reached when a loved one needed to share their concerns about your drinking? 

I'm considering taking a ""break"" with the condition that if he doesn't take this seriously this time then I won't be coming back. (Though this scenario has happened multiple times without my full commitment either cause, y'kno, codependency)

My heart is so torn. I want my love for him to be unconditional. I can't help but feel terribly guilty to have to leave him over this when I want to be his support.. to be there to help him get through this and yet it seems like I can do nothing right.

He refuses to go to AA. But he also said that the way I approached him about going was really wrong.. so what is the best way to approach that conversation?? What was it that lead you to going to your first meeting? Is getting sober something someone can fully do on their own without AA meetings? Or does that mostly depend on the individuals will power/determination? I must admit I have a hard time wrapping my head around his thought process.  Really need some insight. 

Thank you for reading I would appreciate any thoughts on the matter.

alcoholism,Throwaway2836l920,2020/01/19,"Advice? I don't know how to talk to my mom about her drinking.

Background - a bunch of really crappy stuff has been happening to my mom the last couple of years, causing her to spiral into depression and alcohol abuse, culminating in her her being hospitalized for suicidally and an attempt twice this last year, her not taking to me for the six months between the two hospitalizations and her being homeless for part of that time. Prior to this year, she hasn't had major issues, we've always been really close. After her hospitalization and attempt she contacted me again and apologized for pushing me away. She's been living on my couch for about 7 months now. She has no job and no savings. We have no family. 

Most of this time she's been good - not drinking (at least that I could tell) I was trying to get her to seek active treatment but she doesn't have insurance, doesn't want meditation, and actively lied to and manipulates her therapists/doctors in the hospital to get released she admitted - and this expressed a derision to talk to someone. I've tried to encourage her to try to seek help however suits her - whether she wants to try mindfulness based relapse prevention or if she wants to try to volunteer somewhere to get her doing something.  I didn't press it because it seemed like she was doing better - I guess I just really wanted to believe it. Hoped she'd realize it with some space.

Thursday afternoon she was sleeping at the wrong time when I got home. She's been actively drunk or asleep since then.  She has:

1) fallen over. Repeatedly.
2) tried to use the bathroom in our closet. Twice.
3) not been able to form coherent sentences at times
4) yelled, screamed, cried, repeated phrases over and over, jumped topics, etc
3) gotten convinced that a maintenance guy outside was trying to kill her, screamed at him, then hid and cried

She literally can't follow a conversation now and I can't sleep. She's stubborn and so so angry right now. I'm trying to wait until she's sober enough to impress that I cannot do this. But she has nothing else and will probably die/kill herself if she's put in the street. I'm worried she's going to get the cops called on her or I'll get kicked out of my house when someone complains.  Hospital doesn't seem to help because they can't hold her long enough to get through and she's intelligent enough to fake it when even pretty drunk.

I guess I'm asking for any tips for how to talk to her without just kicking her out?

alcoholism,VenusGirdle,2020/01/19,"Some questions about drinking and dealing with alcooholics/heavy drinkers Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this.

I'm 17 and don't drink. But most of my school colleagues do(of 50 in my class, 42 drink). Almost all of them are heavy drinkers. As far as I know, most of them started drinking 2 years ago. They drink twice in the weekend and once or twice during the week. And they drink heavily. Generally until some among them starts blacking out.

Would this qualify them as alcoholics?
I suppose it is not easy to know when someone is an alchoholic, but is it possible or probable that they are?

How should I deal with them?
Generally when I meet them, they are sober. I don't speak with them very much, for almost all of them that were my friends stopped being when they started to drink. I still worry for them, however. How should I deal with them generally? Is there something I could do to try to change something on them to the better?Treatment is out of question, for they have not yet felt the bad permanent effects of alcohol and they keep it secret from their parents.

Would you recomend that someone don't start to drink?

Thanks in advance.",3.963663594470045,6.400658304147465,3.4866612903225835,89.38999193548388,74.25345622119816,6.5519815668202765,27.90069124423963,7.554174236665415,1.5684748387096774,920,37,176,12,20,273,116,217,0.076,0.887,0.036000000000000004,-0.7791,2,0,14,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,19,2,9,4,0,0,6,0,21,10,0,3,2,45,32,19,0,6,7,1,1,0,1,4,2,1,0,0,9,11,10,2,7,9,0,1,5,2,0,2,2,3,31,2,33,24,7,25,0,0,1,0,31,9,0,11,15,129,40,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07973570283966548,0.19225948628703715,0.1801448917223027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840915876169916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07510492146671277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07955391936531082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09515571618144143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07181816562260046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2782050888536081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7049380690347626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08636659900332483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0694955435331281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07995214930037595,0.0,0.0,0.09886889952831013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0661239771993151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09579436112061666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09987940022263804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09397914152862116,0.0,0.0,0.1014056885632882,0.0,0.0,0.09698186718618894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.201530322335478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09103472180547872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15242955623346635,0.1384965996238737,0.0,0.10069223541195443,0.25466974547373594,0.0,0.07183459620764918,0.07520265693295335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08281434752062937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06107049410253496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07421859394785436,0.0,0.0,0.07215287613080253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09134911267554137,0.0,0.12779652784850734,0.09834676575198413,0.0,0.05792518149632931
alcoholism,HannahChristine23,2020/01/19,"How do I even begin? I’ve struggled with alcohol for years. I am not a drink every day person, but when I socialize I always feel like I need a drink and am prone to overdoing it and blacking out. 

Last night was bad. I’ve learned that having a “big night out” or going into “party mode” are triggers for me. I drank way too much, blacked out, and did quite a lot of harmful embarrassing things. I feel so done with this. Done with the shame, the self hatred, the embarrassment, the ruining of relationships, etc. I absolutely must stop because I will ruin my life and I will ruin important relationships.

I feel like I need advice from people who have been there. I feel so lost and need to talk about it. I think the problem stems from anxiety, liking the “drunk me” more because she’s more sociable, boredom, and the lack of an “off switch.” How do I even start? Alcohol seems so engrained in my life and I can’t imagine socializing without it. I want to be able to have fun and feel fulfilled without it.",3.600365384615383,5.411538071794876,4.654407051282053,83.40007211538463,73.41025641025641,7.746794871794872,27.059294871794872,8.472884824447931,1.898391025641026,784,29,154,14,16,256,119,195,0.256,0.622,0.121,-0.9855,0,0,4,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,2,11,15,0,4,12,0,18,8,0,3,1,41,34,16,0,7,5,0,5,3,0,3,4,0,0,2,8,15,6,1,9,3,0,1,4,11,0,0,7,7,22,4,23,23,6,18,0,4,2,0,9,7,0,3,12,110,30,1,0.1199597685188635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11722329743444647,0.0,0.2564010209029565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998161371843898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09176889457260523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10016139599037252,0.14625272292556565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0773641266706249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2455209846736744,0.0,0.23502980797527825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337868518312593,0.15846459147837486,0.0,0.10107127879953423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3032763167544336,0.1713985651979424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06817590092322047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09778322215989654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16946226427339914,0.17581885048907486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309502580056896,0.10198550539282007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881842326092355,0.26684594505608883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22514823291474506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08316499914750547,0.10474424280670004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147852975519385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12759197995958746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2575837953982781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10920686788575487,0.1251442008185622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2445677542302227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490814158719169,0.0,0.0,0.10029173792463264,0.0,0.1254079961140704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09641911794019263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07969593984879184,0.07686537590373277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0707553795228565,0.09521848058265996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2312738721557241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772501578906448
alcoholism,Xanthippie-,2020/01/20,"I MESSED UP (not the word I wanted to use but I think I can't swear?) I'm so ashamed. I know it could be worse and everything but I peed in my friend parent's bed last week and I just left. He hasn't talked to me since, but we can spend a long time without talking so it's not unusual. 


What the hell should I do to make him forgive me? I'm so ashamed. It's the not worst thing I've done but it's definitely not the greatest. I couldn't handle the situation when it happened because I'm too anxious and just freaked out. Now I feel like it's too late to talk about it and I should just disappear and never talk to him again. 


I'm 22 btw. I really suck at drinking. I don't like drinking. Drinking doesn't like me neither because it messes me up each time I drink (I'm kidding, I know it's my fault).

alcoholism,FatherChrimbus,2020/01/20,"Also posted on r/ mental health. Struggling with apathy Hi there,

I'm 26 and married (for now at least). 

I've been dating my now wife for about 10 years now. About a year ago I became addicted to alcohol. A short time after that I started compulsively lying about everything, big or small. From getting promotions at work, to being in a car accident, to what time I would come home from work. 

I recently got discovered, and naturally my wife is furious. 

I'm going to my first AA meeting later tonight, and I'm starting therapy that specializes in sexual abuse later this week. 

The worst part is that I feel very little emotion or remorse. I don't know if I'm in shock or just apathetic and depressed. But it's really hard for me feel right now. And that makes me want to drink again and end my massive 12 hours of sobriety already. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this here other than are there others that feel this way? Is this normal with alcoholism? For others struggling with something like this, how did you cope?",4.665416666666669,6.234535375000004,5.658000000000001,78.2456666666667,70.25,9.133333333333336,28.833333333333336,9.558583805096642,2.750433333333334,825,31,150,19,15,272,128,200,0.185,0.797,0.018000000000000002,-0.9869,0,0,4,0,1,0,25.0,0,1,0,4,14,8,1,2,4,0,10,5,0,2,0,26,29,13,0,4,6,2,4,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,16,10,3,0,5,1,0,3,2,6,1,1,3,5,14,2,28,24,3,39,0,1,1,0,5,11,0,4,23,98,30,3,0.0,0.1623521289863265,0.0,0.14937739328396554,0.0,0.0,0.12146432790999072,0.2928759445832336,0.0,0.0,0.1512104114660825,0.10957878257323588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11803483939371312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11801936664022485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13423226002292007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541345969504455,0.12136341190629635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12314916667338267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20785175681370588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11655333073403275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0715898675275218,0.0,0.07787442230293755,0.0,0.10959134954404637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274741786501454,0.0,0.0,0.14565108711110986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13744717154816385,0.0,0.1349419490095963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506106299276583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06694345668773738,0.13733497203355474,0.0,0.0,0.11506642592505414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09146520108327316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13808889523477094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13425533281029994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1483846401929473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.262464000862212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755633506468692,0.0,0.13529558207976464,0.0,0.0,0.11701853678489485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10548848127017696,0.0,0.0,0.19397389357172384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2864964046621341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15669994294388034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15980067073871818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11305991307843667,0.08082085063126535,0.10876400703951046,0.1099131291740616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19951155391043374,0.0,0.0,0.0973385748888602,0.0,0.0,0.1764791176084249
alcoholism,leaporlepor,2020/01/20,"What do do about my fathers worsening alcohol induced behaviour. My father is a chronic alcoholic and has begun to show increased aggression and some potential signs of alcoholic dementia. I have serious concerns that he could harm himself or someone else. My mother has already left him due to his constant verbal abuse and now my sister is baring the brunt of his behaviour. 

He is always screaming and shouting and my sisters older son has started saying that he doesn't like his grandpa. We have not long found out that he has definitely been drink driving when he has had my sister and her children in the car and that he has stolen alcohol from other peoples houses when visiting. He has also recently completely lost all control and threw things at my sister whilst she was holding her baby but fortunately she managed to turn so that nothing hit him.

She doesn't have anywhere else to live and she is scared that if she does eventually move out that father will kill himself but she is also terrified that if she calls the police that social services would get involved. After the most recent bout of bad behaviour, mother and I are concerned about the safety of my sister and her children. We tried to speak to his doctor but he cannot take a verbal report of this.

We are at a loss of what to do. If we call the police all hell would break loose, although in the long run it might do some good. I've also been considering writing a letter detailing fathers behaviour and addressing it to his doctor in the hope that he might be able to do something, although I'm not entirely sure that it would come to anything.

My family are at their wits end and we don't know what to do. Anything we've thought of would definitely cause father to go ballistic although I've reached the point where I would do it and take full responsibility and make sure that father knows that I'm to blame. 

Currently he is spending over £100 a week on alcohol and has got into serious debt because of it. He needs help but won't even listen if anyone makes even the slightest mention of him having an issue with drink. I know that mother is trying to convince my sister to go to the council and see if she can get emergency accommodation.

Everyone is so stressed at the situation that it's hard to think straight and to properly plan out what to do. I am desperately looking for any advice or resources that can help us figure this out.",8.53754191531685,7.670747869281048,8.414829970635598,70.2771696504689,61.5925925925926,11.207009567111866,38.0393104101544,10.374825546531014,3.9731465567869657,1948,83,336,37,23,631,227,459,0.146,0.7909999999999999,0.063,-0.9907,2,0,8,1,1,0,23.0,6,0,1,4,13,18,3,2,18,0,53,10,0,5,4,75,81,39,1,13,13,17,1,1,0,9,8,5,1,2,30,30,7,2,8,3,2,10,7,12,0,0,9,8,43,6,48,60,7,47,1,2,2,0,71,19,1,13,18,243,73,5,0.08471396936020027,0.10037220116105504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08278151041615085,0.0,0.4526673504142676,0.0,0.0,0.0934839717352754,0.2032371920731141,0.07048880880228008,0.0,0.0,0.05760840413072616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05923397707454825,0.0,0.13942475737092688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07073262591090312,0.05164084943534203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1730048686127002,0.0,0.0,0.08702458206975977,0.0,0.07297358351633566,0.0888209851234556,0.09154570568940584,0.09501392001248864,0.06763721129569568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734166745568061,0.0741337654644767,0.0,0.0,0.16597487805605932,0.0,0.0,0.14153530228264705,0.0,0.07503143241488812,0.0,0.0,0.11190555561187808,0.0,0.0,0.08094782806107317,0.0,0.0,0.0798607909625972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09288449486708933,0.0,0.0,0.08851910510112107,0.0,0.09628980204318363,0.07105405827228285,0.06775350006573025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07588707702739743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11356397593661435,0.0,0.0,0.08414008612899307,0.0,0.09774854672642523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08841937463184102,0.0,0.0,0.0937234556782944,0.0,0.13966974629601547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09204197557958664,0.0,0.0,0.04138696636151814,0.0,0.07480398697692284,0.1499383941812509,0.07113839850419137,0.0,0.09247530469067138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11309446472537282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17973626850720492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003754281786383,0.0,0.06281433487378035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08128533834950034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05872999987087344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800820830201244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16728964954756936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06736794860499037,0.08481346180100284,0.0,0.06750606562549281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952220509370436,0.0,0.0863552234810046,0.07177787133167643,0.06521695236356359,0.0,0.0,0.05996098353355716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970395656834838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1596838271466842,0.0,0.12738872435060478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05628019701806339,0.05428129096585544,0.0,0.06725342902979671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11503044884916475,0.09214447243522167,0.0,0.0,0.10190047458438532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06795243635289244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3008918663548276,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,hurricanesophie_,2020/01/20,"Forced into sobriety I found out today that I am in the early stages of liver disease. The doc says that currently the damage is reversible, but that I need to abstain from alcohol forever. 

I have been drinking heavily and regularly since I was 14. I am now 27. I have always known my drinking was a problem but I have been unable to stop. Over the years, my alcohol consumption has ebbed and flowed and I actually now drink less than ever before. However, this hasn’t prevented my liver from being damaged. 

I can’t imagine my life without alcohol. The idea of never having another drink terrifies me. I want to cry. I want to drink. 

If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation, please talk to me. I’d love to hear success stories or anything to help me see the light at the end of this tunnel.",2.67625,5.152751159235674,4.77190684713376,78.32754179936306,78.80891719745223,8.001433121019106,27.646894904458605,8.841846274778883,2.6971786624203817,640,28,113,16,16,220,98,157,0.13699999999999998,0.738,0.125,-0.4497,3,0,8,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,9,0,18,12,2,0,2,24,25,8,0,5,6,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,5,5,8,3,4,5,0,1,4,3,0,0,6,4,19,2,20,18,1,18,0,2,1,1,5,6,0,3,10,84,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.12587728323562036,0.0,0.0,0.12604918764634698,0.0,0.413558666713652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10733142030170767,0.0,0.0,0.08771877325958721,0.1352590351080356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09019398962129158,0.0,0.10614917096853048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10976242843665536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416913156869694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6318137481273249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11424835154968653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11668036951100358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14143273134399878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453830106969761,0.0,0.0864604115142282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14561591832601267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09111064615938562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11642003738698642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956457045007101,0.0994863442595916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415941413467634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234276276715146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10257937010778616,0.0,0.0,0.10278967719383653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670325983886987,0.14499206533312636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784282962275273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10367863518542554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12226904055748798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521652829370804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12434338713836485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306641990780984
alcoholism,TaxiFare,2020/01/20,"I finally convinced my mom to go to rehab in a very unfortunate way She has been an alcoholic for a long time. Attempts to talk to her haven't really worked out so I began to read up on how to go about talking to someone with alcoholism about quitting. I begin to focus very hard for several days on the physical aspect of alcoholism, and not just how much it has hurt her social life. I managed to get a lot of things about alcohol dependance memorized along with mapping out her consumption in magnitude of ways. 

It ended with me studying up on liver sirrhosis and running down a number of different studies and articles about it. I ran her and her consumption through all of it and it's... not good. I found a way to get her to go to rehab, except at the cost of having to break the news that her liver could shut down at any moment. 

At first during the conversation when I was running down some numbers, she said ""Alright, I'll cut down on my drinking."" and it ended up with her having a panic attack, needing to lay down, almost vomiting, silently crying, and agreeing that the only option is detox and rehab.

I used to like Garfield when I was a small kid and as I've gotten older, days like today think he was damn right when he said ""I hate Mondays"" cause this sure has been a difficult one before it's even noon.",6.769111969111968,6.255500332046331,7.43426640926641,74.71309845559847,64.98455598455598,10.488803088803088,33.55791505791505,9.957137785484203,3.2287019305019307,1042,39,193,20,14,347,147,259,0.11699999999999999,0.83,0.053,-0.9517,1,0,5,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,4,12,13,4,1,14,1,13,13,2,5,2,37,29,16,0,2,4,1,1,2,0,0,10,2,0,1,11,16,5,0,3,2,1,6,3,7,0,2,11,3,23,6,54,17,4,51,0,1,0,0,20,23,1,5,20,140,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.491357322085921,0.1150990170804603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07816532150322976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13076449031864532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09780820215459073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180783349028564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091772796804314,0.0,0.12625971423599575,0.1482577174323408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12009118562944612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11260058233232385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2036111267463316,0.0,0.0,0.07591890336478367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12591466355626887,0.0,0.0977706321206476,0.0,0.12602929231429166,0.0,0.0,0.12010616183198372,0.0,0.19597461814187198,0.09640890756770568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10296653523549207,0.11348261894577248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12304907910312175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08118778551929895,0.11231088868042363,0.0,0.0,0.10172112006661606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772060314916148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13462009340541048,0.0,0.0,0.08449648178560801,0.08522893064836387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788849099241972,0.08741948753754476,0.0,0.13486108608969213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12225624798957364,0.11497431104736006,0.0,0.07363556091388157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816086970006886,0.21867462085868716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298531052525499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171701231570099,0.0973910052555248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10833261115394664,0.0,0.0,0.1847739896749895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763631584759643,0.07365096506281174,0.0,0.0,0.06702430764111103,0.0,0.10895271912643778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09927402463931713,0.0,0.18968036519537326,0.0,0.2737096997552161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368002277733297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,fouton-friend,2020/01/20,"I have been asked to assist a family member with their detox, what can I do to provide a good space for them? I recently had a family member reach out to me about crashing at my apartment while they try and sober up. It is something that I am incredibly happy to do for them, but it is also an area that I am completely unfamiliar with. He reached out to me because he would rather not go through it while living at home with his parents, and having known them for years I would agree that this might be for the best. 

Some background:

I'm currently in graduate school, so I will be in and out of my place quite often. I hardly drink, and I quit any and all drug use a couple of years ago, so maintaining a ""substance"" free apartment won't be difficult at all. I've got a pretty comfortable futon (which I'm just now realizing I misspelled in my throwaway) for him to crash on.

Like I said, this is really new to me.

alcoholism,bluthbitchtwss69,2020/01/20,"My boyfriend came home drunk and I’m scared. Need some support. He asked if he could go out for a beer - I told him it wasn’t a good idea, but that he was an adult. He’s 30 - I’m not his mother. I’ve had to disconnect myself from his choices because it’s hurt so much over the years when he’s chosen to drink, not come home, hurt himself, hurt others, verbally abuse me, etc. 

He’s finally asleep. He came home at 3:30 am telling me he needed to report his Uber driver and that he shouldn’t be as fucked up as he is. I was scared that he got drugged - turned out he wasn’t - just extremely drunk. 

He eventually started screaming at me about how fucked up the world is and getting angry (he calls it raging) about how no one gives a fuck and wants to help end all of the suffering. He kept saying “I can’t do this” over and over. He wouldn’t let me touch him. He has two guns in our bedroom and I had 911 ready to go because I was scared he was going to make a move for the one in the dresser drawer. 

After yelling at me and my part in all of this, he looked up Jeff Bezos’ net worth and freaked out about how he could be helping so many people with his money and how he’s angry that no one gives a fuck. He yelled at me that I’m the problem and that phones are the problem and then THREW his phone so hard at our bedroom wall that it’s completely ruined and the wall is damaged. 

I yawned (it’s 4:30 am now) and he got upset because to him it was a signal that I’m uninterested. He went to bed. 

I’m downstairs on the couch. I love him so much but he’s got so many issues that he doesn’t work on or try to resolve. I’m scared right now. I don’t know how to leave - and I’m scared that he will go off the deep end with drinking and in the state he’s in - hurt himself. 

I didn’t know where to put this. I needed to talk to someone but it’s 5 am where I am.

I’m sober. He keeps drinking even though he promises he’ll stop. I understand how that goes. He’s not jeopardizing my recovery - there’s no alcohol in the house/he knows better than to drink around me. 

I don’t know what to do. He’s a good person when he’s sober, but he doesn’t do anything to help the world that aligns with his misguided anger. He won’t talk to anyone. “Therapy and groups are all bullshit”. Fuck the world mentality. He’s in a dangerous place to be alone but he won’t let anyone in - and I can’t do it anymore. I’m scared. 

Sorry. Thanks for letting me post. I’m open to any advice. Any ways I can help him? I just am so lost.",0.4938110407113108,2.31115710760668,2.190326600623095,97.47256729793119,82.74768089053805,5.255308572828788,19.07519165470648,6.267924199997599,-0.2844405712885494,1927,48,468,16,53,631,225,539,0.24600000000000002,0.6779999999999999,0.076,-0.9988,0,1,7,1,2,0,61.0,2,0,0,4,27,35,8,7,23,0,45,17,1,7,3,71,97,42,0,11,12,1,2,0,0,6,3,4,8,2,25,28,8,3,7,7,2,11,19,27,0,4,20,7,43,8,61,63,8,63,0,8,1,6,73,37,5,3,12,263,68,2,0.0,0.07852259339522501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476114708912167,0.0,0.07082561483899162,0.0,0.06863877593082816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901357396047617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06572494550246613,0.09267915704157187,0.0,0.054536980387120716,0.0589969646694967,0.061956249970089826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12119810194125985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05861302722392218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06767207850543958,0.1515971693888023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057088267077568276,0.06948591362085778,0.0,0.0,0.10582709514234596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25968899182565275,0.07685556673438995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11739630278550794,0.0,0.07391184329104794,0.04377264989874352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259876316289493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063413120594217,0.034624874303650535,0.12715008018299626,0.15065774958569492,0.11117319062959648,0.15901356576492848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05936753428185765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17768541097364834,0.0,0.19943147833390926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2837861992849713,0.07481407918063429,0.0,0.0691717280498379,0.0,0.058906431523943766,0.0,0.0,0.14568749210309706,0.0,0.0,0.07017347129877377,0.0,0.2033057048439981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05565257587176925,0.0,0.07234473953274817,0.0,0.0598139131724755,0.0,0.04423770011096825,0.1343807124772068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06678753300382627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07043764392142746,0.0974364684143384,0.1474216292847167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13472477194398452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176713259454003,0.0,0.045945310022268884,0.05786697238180626,0.06924111376088686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06347115417970034,0.0,0.0,0.12682850083767205,0.0,0.06662260646181753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05659672614726445,0.0,0.052702899557737166,0.39810462847709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056152844514272486,0.0,0.0,0.07418712720283592,0.04690832596197096,0.0,0.0,0.05540714289489178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07520574361542018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1065353528827334,0.05792546809575338,0.061015216402707725,0.07578887928148803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06511282418365362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06332663143321086,0.0,0.04499497399962294,0.07208592477750514,0.06473902968146683,0.06899246472889423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03908949535555244,0.052604372693616806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06143567662258057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04824748749268918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042677598628477316
alcoholism,SarahSav4ge,2020/01/20,"Asking for help and support: it's getting worse with my loved one Attention: English is not my main Languange, so please be gentle.  
My loved on has te courage to finally go to a clinical treatment. I'm really, really proud of her, but at the same time out of sudden everything seems to get even worse. I'm writing this post because I just wanted a place to share my story, but I'd also hope people can give me advice.   


Since the treatment is coming more in sight, she started to drink even more. Also she started to get violent towards me on every single level: sexually, verbally and physically. When things got physical, I immediately called the police and since that very moment, she isn't welcome in my house anymore: I'm not save around her.   


I don't even recognise her anymore and sometimes she even seems so confused, I wonder if she's psychotic due to all the alcohol. I'm not a specialist, so I don't know anything about it, but the things she said to me are so strange. For example: she screamed I am not save and people want to harm me. Also she thinks she's going to die.   


I'm so worried and at the same time I also feel anger towards her, because of those aggressive outbursts.",6.6208491508491525,6.460777385281388,7.226580086580089,74.90052947052948,65.19047619047619,10.051415251415252,35.08524808524808,9.661875296680813,3.331123609723609,940,40,172,17,13,311,130,231,0.19899999999999998,0.705,0.09699999999999999,-0.9869,0,0,2,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,1,17,16,3,1,9,0,10,5,0,0,1,36,39,20,1,4,9,0,1,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,7,10,2,0,7,1,0,3,7,6,0,1,2,4,29,10,27,36,7,25,0,0,1,2,23,12,0,6,9,119,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11213682329418044,0.0,0.12263772049886652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3670767055709057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2276113667253957,0.0,0.0,0.09443322126849753,0.10215588357216797,0.10728001845466167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13990662356318934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11717723126292608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885088830558382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11909711096638055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11241577665279136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3031772059292595,0.0,0.09668566214150646,0.0,0.10313399486359333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05802335113499087,0.0,0.0,0.1257080061440279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17986355643276772,0.11008302596694247,0.1304353165636545,0.0,0.0917797008805328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0769175594777751,0.0,0.0,0.11397716619052155,0.0,0.13241134954437278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06306610248755735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2071409329030248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0777606565247157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15911271936160448,0.0,0.11989408599899648,0.12596604154436505,0.0,0.0,0.10990314286329712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470294131333572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10915786059406192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20893647448305336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18985230792657368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11349518943210372,0.0,0.1624477297224074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13022210942162896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15247565491979545,0.07353008543355294,0.0,0.0,0.133828608023605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09468452617008287,0.13537041977690886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12444642009277015,0.0,0.11653882119914767,0.2338893911597308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,77DM95,2020/01/20,"Naltrexone and other meds So I am an alcoholic, 10-12 beers a day, every day for many years.  Over the past two months I have cut my drinking down to 2-3 times per week, but still put away 10-12 beers per session.  In the last 2 weeks, I have drank 3 times, and as of this post, have not had a drink in 4 days.  

My doctor prescribed me Naltrexone, 50mg, and I've taken it once.  That one time, I took it with several other meds and I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and I think I was hallucinating.  Everything looked fuzzy, almost like the A-Ha video for Take on Me.  

Is this a side effect of the Naltrexone or the combo of scripts I took?  I've been taking meds for anxiety and a pinched nerve in my back, but have never had the above experience before until I took the Naltrexone with the rest of my meds.  My pharmacist said I could take Naltrexone with the other meds and it would just increase drowsiness, but I was not expecting hallucinations.

I see posts and such on people getting really sick due to withdrawals, is the Naltrexone going to prevent this, or is it strictly to help me stay away from alcohol?

Sorry for the rant, but I'm at a point in my battle where this is the longest I've gone without a drink, and don't know how things are going to go moving forward.

Thanks!",5.019852661596957,5.158480555133083,5.851043250950571,82.39048122623575,68.54372623574146,9.16055133079848,28.224572243346014,9.017664075816787,2.0045667300380225,1018,31,213,17,16,335,148,263,0.068,0.8759999999999999,0.057,-0.4178,0,0,7,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,0,1,7,4,2,0,22,0,18,10,0,3,1,33,40,19,0,3,10,0,0,1,0,1,4,1,0,0,13,12,8,1,3,6,0,11,5,2,0,2,13,3,21,2,35,25,2,49,0,0,2,0,2,18,0,3,20,137,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2037100082196825,0.09543694847570797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07291017095743955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17908954448469766,0.07328577984575654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08109987892428293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07609548632341723,0.0,0.0,0.18439685018976265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09755152477604977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2800959446996625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08030089335260339,0.0,0.08565646383481773,0.09322927155690884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049794367793606485,0.0,0.1624967789349395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06388277851919262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05237864909696519,0.07768854008377267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04656255443416032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08003450950660343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966271034340107,0.0,0.0,0.5293271456121738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607373997072625,0.10129705936777536,0.0,0.0,0.07350721543782808,0.0,0.0,0.08943987082459556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10149964752400244,0.06458300070884042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09098203551041097,0.06607439627293965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09009663373860073,0.0,0.18255696571152527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581061696962424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061056587720513186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09065949933024413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759479404184025,0.0,0.0,0.10767063377035684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668922766600797,0.0,0.10158538468643902,0.07611289547539182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21497870948286515,0.0,0.0,0.08774657490215343,0.0,0.0,0.0633182368170731,0.06106936041836111,0.0,0.0,0.16672415344328673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3176712646339072,0.0,0.0,0.09310182692043144,0.0,0.0,0.08231529872974985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15290026280144622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09187327381132344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677038939436238,0.0,0.0,0.06137506880220683

alcoholism,jewmasek,2020/01/20,"Drinking is sucking my life out My husband was sober for 6 years. He started drinking again about a year ago. To be honest, when he first started drinking again it was somewhat of a relief. I am usually an occasional drinker and when I drank with family occasionally (once every couple months) he wasn’t happy. He didn’t express that my drinking affected him, in fact it was the opposite. He claimed that he was happy that I was doing what I wanted and proud that he didn’t care about drinking. That being said he always had an attitude when I came home after a night having drinks with my family. I always felt so bad. He isn’t a communicator as wasn’t interested in discussing his feelings. SO when he started drinking again it was nice. We were able to share something and have fun while having a few drinks. The fun didn’t last. Since he started drinking again I have been drinking more and it really sucks. This is making a long story short. I miss our old life but my husband is a grown ass man and I am not about to give him an ultimatum. 

There is more to be said for sure. I am struggling and I am tired of spending time, money and emotions on alcohol.

alcoholism,casual__nihilist,2020/01/20,"The journey so far.. I’m 16 days sober. 2019 was a rough year for me. I spent 6 days out of each week ending up drunk through the year. I’d get black out drunk at least twice a month. I tried to kill myself on three separate occasions, all while intoxicated. I made the choice of sobriety on a hungover plane ride to Texas, where I’m at till the end of this month, then I’ll head back to California and start another chapter. I’ve spent the majority of my time in Texas in a state of complete isolation. I go to my class that I’m attending, I eat alone, I go to the gym alone, I go to the hotel room and sit inside it alone. Listening to music or writing or reading. But this isolation is eating me alive. I know if I make an attempt to go out I’ll probably drink, so I’m forcing myself to be reclusive. A means to an end perhaps...I’m not even sure if I know what’s best or not. For a year I was barely in my body, I was just trying to drown everything away. Now I’m in this loneliness and everything I did drown out is rising back up.",1.0327788649706484,2.894664593607306,3.1867318982387483,90.78972602739726,81.14611872146119,6.911154598825831,22.30071754729289,7.957251820313856,0.986419699934768,802,26,184,15,21,273,123,219,0.156,0.812,0.032,-0.9742,0,5,1,0,0,1,27.0,0,0,0,2,8,3,1,0,15,0,7,8,2,2,2,25,26,14,3,2,9,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,8,5,0,3,6,2,8,2,1,0,2,7,3,20,2,35,18,5,47,0,0,1,0,2,18,0,5,19,110,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4042060771433638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13641207672181666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12222506389268452,0.20006436779648346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365227991617263,0.0,0.0,0.14450211346225927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13639825876126882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.167796259767912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12743995314561118,0.0,0.2662317657817141,0.0,0.0,0.34566685067261066,0.0,0.0,0.08592408038458979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23383535415550916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679673378206556,0.0,0.2957355475601269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335112108199824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439267549424243,0.0,0.14298955867936985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12309553877202555,0.0868369566191907,0.0,0.0,0.14170756929909248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20767527786686546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14026043027700158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13012651008837905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920792956329251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12260951589801382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07585728642318239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17664691407942867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10435139831243384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513236066578508

alcoholism,mtngts,2020/01/21,"It's so easy to keep going, why is it so hard to stop? I'm a functional alcoholic... I drink 700ml of 35%/70 proof on a night and then go to work the next day on the regular at this point. Not every night, not every second night, but I'd say I average out to every third night.

It's so easy to do, what I can't seem to do is not do it.

I'm even playing board games online in a voice chat with friends on the nights I'm drinking.

I'm not out of control, I'm just drunk and then hungover pretty often. I'd like to stop drinking entirely, what are my options that might help that aren't going to meetings.",2.638388464800681,3.127477656488552,4.228651399491096,90.67027141645464,73.9618320610687,7.348939779474131,24.47921967769296,7.3871296695380915,0.8385362171331638,467,13,110,5,9,157,75,131,0.069,0.7559999999999999,0.175,0.9466,0,0,4,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,2,6,3,0,0,6,0,9,5,0,1,1,20,19,8,0,0,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,9,5,5,4,1,7,0,3,6,0,0,2,0,3,4,3,18,18,0,22,0,0,0,0,6,8,0,4,12,63,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14298285245012735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500589924745064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08628470721156457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3931953808541581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836828816878133,0.0,0.3381763385959948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103367290101915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22811106012051616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1198512630472434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08967789039862542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11892038814062908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06536396427985912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14193206300599664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14228920355080982,0.6277731744765589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12647659092141578,0.0,0.0,0.13611446141827235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10639668894210906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121799120943121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2237120385112982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207263798061506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09740209669819452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ian3634,2020/01/21,"Make it real Hi, posting on here as writing this almost makes it more accountable. Today is day 3 of trying to give up for 3 months. I have always used alcohol as a constant in my life as at times it’s felt like the only thing that has been there, saying that sounds so sad. I have amazing people around me and I want to give up for them aslweel as myself.  

People say it’s the devil and it really is...anything bad that has ever happens to me has always been because of it.  And yet I have never been able to give it up. There is always something that makes me drink again and again.  In a strange way the thought of not drinking seems like a scary prospect as Iv never been sober in certain social situations.

Good luck to anyone else trying to give up.",3.1855701754385954,4.686463960526319,4.100000000000001,88.22833333333338,73.86842105263158,6.119298245614036,23.85087719298245,6.42735559955562,0.6426035087719302,590,17,119,4,12,190,91,152,0.10400000000000001,0.7709999999999999,0.125,0.1012,0,0,4,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,1,0,9,9,0,0,6,0,12,5,0,4,4,22,25,10,0,1,1,0,1,2,0,0,3,3,0,0,13,5,3,0,3,2,1,0,3,3,0,0,6,4,10,6,26,19,1,23,1,1,0,0,10,10,0,3,13,83,23,0,0.12573034977938144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13436750687314772,0.1259007835926533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3138531691943019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791358394198619,0.12882560147430294,0.10346536494834473,0.11192666768576004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10497959030556472,0.07664405423859573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13586984158644427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108567419538226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2463357534794328,0.0,0.0,0.10503157387456898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373029957382084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12072085294001003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.482448032727965,0.0,0.1054566521589038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111829330790503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08880706433736585,0.12285099603385807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2517779543697105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10035676565639624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19394199356011804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09562359663376772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17433118721921462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12041492000987658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14310866392553326,0.08054608157827693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19997164118257546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11446018833745532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413261810471758,0.0,0.1281662580037755,0.0,0.09679336588929166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08352965762525191,0.0,0.0,0.09981585350847448,0.07331437805304665,0.0,0.11917767032692998,0.0,0.0,0.17072530868656888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10859065359132616,0.0,0.0,0.07415901786091504,0.09979889938881067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1. I am way more consistent with my gym schedule 
2. I am not depressed like I was. I had no idea how much drinking (even though I was only doing it on the weekends) was adding to my overall depression. Now, on days where I am feeling emotional, everything doesn't seem like a dark hole. I feel like I can healthily sit with my emotions and anxiety now. 
3. My brain feels way sharper. I didn't realize how much of a fog I was in a lot of the time. I was also consistently asking to work from home and loosing motivation, so I feel ambitious again. 
4. I don't have hangovers (a serious gift resulting in a lot more productive free time.

alcoholism,Moonpyu,2020/01/21,"My roommate let his alcoholism take over I am very worried about my roommate alcoholism. He  has been drinking alcohol since I met him. I am very worried about his health because he drinks it every day, there were times where he was throwing up everywhere because he was drinking and not eating. I told him MANY time to stop because of his health but he doesn’t listen to me. He stop liquor for a couple of month and switch over to margaritas, I didn’t mind that because I thought it was a step for him to stop. But he has been taking wine from his workplace and being drunk at work and he almost got in trouble with it while at work and it really disappoints me that he is doing that. But recently he had been doing liquor again and drinking it before going to work. He doesn’t learn his lesson and it really disappoints me. He REALLY lets his alcoholism take over him. How can I make him stop??",4.436826373626374,5.8902784057142865,4.8988571428571435,83.91668131868133,70.65714285714286,8.127472527472527,27.17582417582417,8.617729084823388,1.9214263736263728,711,24,137,12,13,226,89,175,0.154,0.846,0.0,-0.9771,0,0,9,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,4,6,3,0,0,2,0,22,15,0,2,0,23,32,12,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,0,9,8,13,4,3,9,0,3,4,3,0,0,13,1,23,0,20,16,0,22,0,2,0,0,26,8,0,1,11,92,32,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4417600534898787,0.10348100182214323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25198265777222306,0.0,0.08793550980808497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434476020217725,0.0,0.06664634293548348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4049390294049241,0.0,0.10574355821249676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706918048050928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05873102519736356,0.0,0.08265117250496345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21969312681047806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2113461804528704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689808652269258,0.1047714708634926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10434486800566506,0.0,0.08248573482556099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19860851481756486,0.0,0.10203668939344272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08548467527329334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34559053902478243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23309852822233526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08204114560723004,0.12051784067433433,0.0,0.0,0.09874667573612046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17053416018910034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2257002572865989,0.20989543705298536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,PM_YOUR_SIDEBOOB,2020/01/21,"Am I going through withdrawal? Hi everyone

I recently started the Keto diet and, although not necessary, decided to go the extra mile and completely cut out drinking. Partly because most alcoholic drinks are ripe with carbs, but also because I feel it's been an unspoken problem in my life for too long.
My alcohol use has been a sliding scale but I would say for the last few months my average week included one or two days of heavy drinking, 3 or 4 days of drinking a couple to sleep, and maybe once a week where I didn't drink at all.

I started keto two weeks ago and haven't had a drop of alcohol the whole time. I deal with pretty crippling anxiety and depression on a regular basis but this last week has been ABSOLUTE HELL. This is the worst I've ever felt mentally.
The reason I'm not sure if it's withdrawal is because 1) every website and every person says days 7-10 are the worst and it gets better, but I'm sitting on day 15 wanting to die. 2) I'm not really experiencing the other general signs. I'm a tad shakey, but I always am. I'm a bit more irritable than usual, but that's probably a direct result of increased anxiety. Beyond that, I've exhibited absolutely no physical signs of alcohol withdrawal.
It could be the diet, it could be the immediate decrease in alcohol. It could be a million other things or none at all. Sometimes mental illnesses just get worse for no reason. 
I guess I'm just hoping someone has an answer because experiencing this is just making me want to go back to drinking even more.",6.109587087087085,6.5153043581081125,7.606441441441443,69.81753753753756,66.22972972972973,11.037237237237237,35.025525525525524,10.864195022040775,4.099713813813814,1214,55,212,33,18,421,169,296,0.18899999999999997,0.7440000000000001,0.067,-0.9932,0,0,11,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,1,10,9,2,0,21,0,23,16,1,5,4,52,44,19,1,9,16,0,2,0,0,1,7,2,0,1,14,10,13,0,6,6,0,5,8,6,0,4,6,6,13,3,25,31,14,37,1,1,0,0,5,10,1,7,20,144,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07062134937699681,0.4257071759755164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06371089867755275,0.06629060325564617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189242246639807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061260185790490876,0.0,0.19426079798313095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07046034503645468,0.08697740627969393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08353094321838203,0.0,0.0,0.19082652759382016,0.0881517186874965,0.0,0.2055184571155292,0.08213476137908685,0.06861839247920998,0.0,0.08268336131836236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.468269005189768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05262031601341022,0.07206475104152768,0.13424835367178578,0.07612669933825424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0402828050812328,0.0,0.07649428732046752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083247042708054,0.0,0.13583239325367044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877638732421745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07912883140241912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12988097852927422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0562722423679816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050414647620262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05317936576676023,0.0,0.08003775161342562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16057429013536978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06359066457630153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08484438970392917,0.05398546117211106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862732597920559,0.0,0.0,0.0695634918268298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08105154147769206,0.08589615544697049,0.0762320285500574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05103770356765355,0.16382504556682315,0.07866306705537131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12671123342846796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.079726070690094,0.0,0.0675028911941135,0.0,0.07879421826075722,0.0,0.1127795982874603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07508665142445717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052928234638480086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046455363451565285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15564916486073255,0.0,0.0,0.06880803484929032,0.08774363584626681,0.0,0.09398113219885018,0.0,0.2556211730664645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.088947074230111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08118904346575992,0.05659424148116286,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,upstate518ny,2020/01/21,"Attempting Medical Alcohol Detox I went to see a counsler and did a 3 hour assessment she advised me the safest way to quit drinking is to go through a medical assisted detox. I've been drinking 12 to 15 beers a day for about 5 years. She referred me to go to a hospital where they would facilitate that.

I went to the hospital and got checked in at the ER. They took my vitals and my blood sample and said since my ethonal level was low enough they would send me right upstairs to the detow room. (The whole process took 4 hours. Totally understandable on a sunday)

I got sent upstairs to what I thought was going to be the detox center that I would spend a few days to be supervised during the physical whithdwaral symptoms.


I was questioned if I had shakes which I did not
 I was asked when my last drink was which was the night before at 10 (this was about 6 the next day) then I was asked to take a breathalyzer to which I
 blew a 0.0. They then explained that I did not meet the criteria for medical withdrawal and I was recommended for outpatient treatment. I explained that my counselor who was part of this program told me to come here. I drove an hour from home to do this. I asked to speak to a doctor and was told that there was no doctor there (again understandable at 6pm on a sunday) Then right before I was about to leave they said I could stay the night and figure it out in the morning.

I felt uncomfortable and left. I contacted my counselor the next day and  I'm meeting with her tomorrow.  It was very upsetting because it was really difficult to go through the process to get help and end up feeling like no one cared.

 I also feel like when they told me I could stay the night maybe I should have. I was prepared to spend a few days I had my iPad a bunch of music I wanted to listened to. Figured it would suck pretty bad but I would keep myself busy. When they were going to admit me the told me I had to leave all my clothes and all of my things and I could get quarters for if I had to use the pay phone. All my stuff had to be locked up until I left. What the hell was I going to do for 3 days?  

No one at the recovery program I am in told me what to expect and what the process looks like. Thought I'd share my experience. It was really difficult for me and my girlfriend who came with me to go through all of that just for me to end up at home. I took 2 weeks off work to get clean. This is my first experience trying to get help. Hopefully my counselor can help my tomorrow. Sorry for the long post just wanted to share my experience.

alcoholism,Landolakes51,2020/01/21,"First sober day in two years! For the last 2 years I’ve been Drinking about 500 - 750 ml of whiskey every day and adding in glasses of wine or beer when I’m around family or my girlfriend. 
I’ve been tapering myself off of alcohol for the last 5 days. Only drinking a beer or small amounts of whiskey when I start to feel symptoms. I have terrible withdrawals every morning I  get shakes, cold sweats, nausea, insomnia, anxiety and paranoia. I’m still experiencing all of the symptoms, but they aren’t as extreme as before.I feel so pathetic saying this, but I never thought alcohol would catch up to me.

i have been sober since December 17, 2018 and im in a professional program at school, which has been my dream career for the last 5 years. that requires random testing as a condition of me being enrolled. i initially did not like this and lost my sobriety once while in the program, but because of this i have taken my sobriety much more seriously. I am now active in AA and see an addiction counselor. i like them but dont like paying them! haha.

this comes to my problem. i have had dreams where i lost my sobriety and get called in the day. i am confused and worried in my dream because I dont remember what happened the previous night(within the dream) and feel that i lost my sobriety and then stressed because i blew it",4.423184952978058,6.001206779310343,5.175736677115992,81.43338557993731,70.86206896551724,8.58307210031348,31.8025078369906,9.095868883498916,2.819689655172413,593,27,112,12,11,192,88,145,0.196,0.6970000000000001,0.107,-0.9004,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,2,4,2,12,0,2,8,1,13,1,0,0,1,18,22,12,0,1,3,0,1,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,8,8,0,1,2,5,1,1,3,8,1,0,8,2,21,4,11,13,3,14,0,3,1,0,4,7,0,2,9,78,29,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17661747025499308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962838335354857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16543281224505915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13955936890692666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10448461890524267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3797547390975717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08191835607214179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846448115115034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14326706297760844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17500123342497484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13206175966027933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2374532794497897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5305671397876519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11909778257893465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520376970933881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725379578823841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15502402194366172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18352850867468168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1639652356669648,0.1291029364615809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13401836206999196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855846991912848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645314940360683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433069763635774

So I haven't had a single drink in almost three weeks after about two years straight of drinking every day or every other day.

Anyone else experienced something like this? How can I help my body adjust?

alcoholism,jessicahallihan,2020/01/22,"I started at 22 I dated a girl in highschool. In highschool I never really had many friends which at the time i was fine with but after dating this girl who was very possessive I felt like I wanted friends. She helped me get a job where I could have friends and then i started hanging out with sed friends and mostly all they did was drink and do shit. She never accepted them because we never smoked or drank when we were together so she saw it as something bad for me. We had been dating 6 or 7 years and in my eyes she was trying to keep me from anyone that wasn't her.

So i broke up with her feeling super trapped. 

I tried to live my life without her and after that finding a boyfriend who wanted to drink all the time. I tried to stop him because I saw it wasn't healthy. But he wouldn't stop. So i kept drinking with him because it was something i couldn't stop. So every day for 10 months i drank with him doing whatever he wanted. 10 months went by and i decided he wasn't good for me. I broke up with him finding out he was already talking to someone else. Trying to get over him was hard as shit but i have been doing so. 

Months later I find a boy who loves me exactly as who i am no matter what but he also likes to drink late at night (which i work early morning he works late at night) so we miss eachpther a lot but he likes to drink whem he gets off to calm down from his shift. 

I love him but (i keep telling him it's fine if he drinks because I don't want to change his daily routines) she (my ex girlfriend) has been the only person who has been checking in and she asks everyday if i have had a drink or not. I know she still loves me but that's not something i want right now. I have from my ex boyfriend become addicted to alcohol and how it makes me feel and i don't know how to get out of it. I go into work at 530am and leave at 3pm and all i want to do is take a drink and go home and nap. And that's not a life I want to live anymore but i don't ,know how to with how everything has gone to live without alcohol. The longest i've been without alcohol in the last 2 years has been 2 days and i want to stop but i don't even know if I'm ready to stop or not",1.414025423728816,2.8443142161016963,2.8870000000000005,95.38130508474579,78.44915254237287,5.821694915254238,22.39322033898305,6.385866456164764,0.21980322033898325,1698,50,402,13,40,555,192,472,0.11900000000000001,0.746,0.136,0.9487,1,1,15,0,0,1,27.0,4,0,2,4,16,22,2,0,13,0,42,22,3,5,7,99,82,47,0,14,23,2,4,3,5,1,6,0,1,4,19,30,13,8,12,9,1,5,20,6,0,0,29,7,71,16,61,50,5,63,0,3,3,3,57,22,2,9,39,267,90,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0686755255245386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2019724233256006,0.0,0.0,0.06951824666316238,0.050378309020632214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062475638445466476,0.044048644411143666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058893259522338225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05259947821998545,0.1536084204512542,0.06957472730676757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06664198461363377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05029760985955559,0.0,0.0,0.08125511142458257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4937009970121136,0.0,0.0,0.05262552431711421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041608619497010814,0.0,0.053077300643784735,0.0,0.05661722669859561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06370588532650066,0.0,0.060486556067075176,0.0,0.17273308453327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19468387727837214,0.0,0.13165236496900107,0.0,0.071604769088552,0.052838507582657325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056432524650066165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04222525179806822,0.0,0.06319066446679511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06251434386417773,0.11198843574132596,0.0,0.0,0.13848500007228334,0.05135058685457872,0.1421256785651029,0.06670423821288687,0.0,0.0,0.08899263624096104,0.09233077979316384,0.0,0.1668812927453137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053557404193722215,0.17057050644029312,0.0,0.04205067857664671,0.06386860226803186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15084970785293642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14576044214660894,0.0,0.0,0.11823596762375052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047911706207029496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05500614746533141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040357195635361234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05379869961004225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12933008282296202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053376762578320434,0.14549343904220785,0.0,0.0,0.08917854828110047,0.0,0.05030911696433026,0.26333963461922305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04736555688171123,0.05063423132174446,0.05506175127066332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07346757632390176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17108205756416367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05197874173409977,0.29725592438963394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05839842225781569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18217924502284286,0.0,0.1375866907816141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08113541064962737

I self medicated with Alcohol as I had social anxiety disorder. It was impossible for me to attend college without having a shot of whiskey. I went into depression &amp; I was addicted by then. I was good at academics, had so many career ambitions. Alcohol has just ruined everything , be it my health, my relationships , career everything. My memory has become so weak that I forget what I ate in the morning by dinner.

Alcohol has become a necessary evil &amp; I feel like this evil I was feeding, is now feeding on me &amp; won't stop till it kills me. I am ashamed as a son, my parents are suffering seeing their son dying in front of their eyes. It must be like a curse have a son like me. I feel helpless...hopeless.

alcoholism,throwaway273893892,2020/01/22,"I might have simply drank too much, or maybe drugged, but I'm not sure. Sorry if this is the wrong place, I tried to google things, but came up pretty empty. I'm probably dumbnuts nr 200 this week asking a question of this kind. I just hope any of you could provide some insight. 

Couple of days ago I (25 f) had a work party with a lot of coworkers that I didn't know at all, save a few people I vaguely know as colleagues. We had free drinks and I've mostly drank wine the whole evening. It was a pretty boring party so I thought I just needed a bit of liquid courage to socialize better(others were going at it pretty heavily too). I can handle booze pretty well usually and I've had nights where I've had double the amount and would be heavily tipsy at most. I've had about 6-7 small glasses for as long as my memory still worked. 

Yes, I'm well aware I've been majorly retarded for drinking that amount with people that I don't know very wellI.

 I remember dancing and being fine overal, except being tipsy and all of the sudden everything goes blurry. I vaguely remember the party being over and people went outside. I couldn't walk or feel anything. I've been drunk before, but this was on a whole other level. My vision was a dark tunnel with flashes. Then I think I passed out because I faceplanted for some reason. That's when I blacked out for 2-3 hours. I ""awakened"" in the toilet of my house while my boyfriend was frantically taking care of me. Apparently I just stormed in at 2 am and ran to the bathroom. The fall had left me with cuts and bruises on my face and my shoulder hurt like hell. I then was in a pained daze on the bathroom floor unable to move while puking my guts out repeatedly. I don't remember how I got home. There's at least an hour between the end of the party and when I got home and I don't remember! I've never experienced this before. Never got shitfaced to this degree with a blackout. Maybe I've just been foolish and there's another explanation. But the way this all went down is extremely weird to me. I've felt sick for days and I'm afraid to ask colleagues, as I'm afraid for the answer. Aside from being mightily embarrassed, I'm also worried I've been taken advantage of. There's no obvious suspect and maybe nothing happened, but I can't help but speculate te possibility since there's a hole in my memory that I can't fill. Which is what scares me most. 

Only thing I could find is it possibly being GHB, which is pretty popular in this area. I don't want to accuse or point fingers. I just want to know if what I described is my own stupidity or if someone tampered with my drink. I'm hoping it's just me being a moron and I can leave this behind me with a lesson learned, but I suspect differently. So at long last. Does any of you know more about this subject?

TLDR: I think I might have been drugged at a work party, but I'm not sure.",3.352308613335328,4.910531108433734,4.6088471900022485,84.51562504677094,73.54388984509467,7.324118835590812,25.53921275162763,7.967736418589885,1.4661718626057023,2278,75,452,33,46,752,275,581,0.147,0.7,0.153,0.8517,2,0,6,0,0,0,61.0,1,2,0,5,25,30,4,5,28,1,48,16,4,2,8,101,87,44,0,12,24,0,3,1,0,3,4,0,2,0,26,27,8,0,23,6,1,11,13,15,2,0,30,5,53,16,65,44,21,65,1,1,1,0,8,30,1,18,24,299,79,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06276452290343182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056622879547356675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09629990538846077,0.07424540836482063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058266632908114686,0.0,0.13238657687850786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043162182582929504,0.0,0.12049999197295368,0.0,0.0,0.06262143075483008,0.07730092184136475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08098226704143498,0.07219060334797713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11306435487666615,0.07834458864560337,0.0,0.09132697139391692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07397634649034154,0.0,0.0,0.06196209310120197,0.0,0.0,0.2080863716176296,0.16422306706644682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06271237636021057,0.0,0.0,0.04676615582603518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06363513325441376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03580122816173572,0.0,0.06798407975578881,0.0,0.06471465484192881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0402402174064326,0.0,0.16988811991548175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06261278980264351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04745922189328813,0.0,0.14204674401260284,0.14065104659403865,0.13945768597217742,0.08169967510516102,0.07579841320858782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0737327026685025,0.1945633852804876,0.057715674675822996,0.0,0.07497246571097957,0.07693003888779555,0.0,0.0,0.03459183607903362,0.0,0.0,0.12532071831903904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060196034870647425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2133999706291225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15022622057748572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07525470446199356,0.05204995671434441,0.052501146288114434,0.10921864480811586,0.0,0.0,0.06644586810350206,0.0,0.06793948305496339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05385053254482832,0.07534170722575857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14726219680193042,0.0,0.07397634649034154,0.0,0.0669337845277648,0.159644411115734,0.0,0.3601716319719654,0.07633996324664084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07931800988445503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07279952107502408,0.0,0.0,0.32083388038006955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07088834060192402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05857077935138845,0.0,0.0,0.07217696772288028,0.05999300208473265,0.0,0.0,0.07926060585958057,0.0,0.0,0.0565451108896589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13346609473331347,0.0,0.05323668606876455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940796352522588,0.09073820501108712,0.0,0.056211406567715214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04807207172337925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07798190618398501,0.0584216915861095,0.08352546328301308,0.05620185883676945,0.05679564718412952,0.0,0.127324726392679,0.13127422867273028,0.0,0.15810291723277345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15464105030314054,0.07190610066184806,0.0,0.05029797075505628,0.07741435281420979,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,timfluencer,2020/01/23,"Are you a survivor of mental illness and/or suicide? (ignore if this doesn't fit the sub) Hey yall,

I'd love to get your thoughts on a mental health awareness campaign I've been working on for the past year. If you're interested in participating, even better.

**WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE?**

***The news is killing people.***

When we lost Robin Williams the suicide rate increased by 10%. Marilyn Monroe: 12%. When Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain committed suicide, the hotline got 25% more calls. It's called *suicide contagion,* and it’s the proven link between mass media coverage of suicide and an increase in suicide rates.

Think about it. If a celebrity with more resources and success couldn’t beat it, how can anyone? It makes you feel hopeless. And hopelessness can be deadly.

With suicide rates increasing across the world, we have to do something now more than ever. Something unprecedented. We have to tell the other side of the story. Where people survive and thrive. We have to #ReportSurvival.

***#ReportSurvival***

\#ReportSurvival is a campaign guiding news organizations to report suicide more responsibly. Whether it’s Buzzfeed, the local news, or CNN, we’ll create a media landscape where a story of someone who survived suicide follows every report of someone who didn't.

**WHY SURVIVOR STORIES?**

***Why survivor stories?***

For every person that dies by suicide, another 280 people survive. Many of whom go on to live happy, fulfilling lives. These stories of survival and perseverance hold extraordinary power. That's why they're an effective way to end suicide contagion. But don't take it from us, take it from them:

“Portraying suicide survivors rather than focusing on completed cases in the media is more effective in reducing suicide contagion.”

* *Madelyn Gould, professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University and expert in youth suicide*

“Our best answers as to why suicides happen and what we can do to prevent them are not found by focusing on the one person who died by suicide, but by focusing on the living—the other 280 who survived.”

* *John Draper, Ph.D., executive director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline*

“It turns out that, although suicide can be contagious, resilience can also be contagious. And when we look at media reports that talk about people who thought about suicide but instead got help and got better, that actually rates across the population, the number of deaths that happen in a specific area, go down. And we really really want to encourage people to report in that kind of way.”

* *Mark Sinyor, M.D., Clinical Researcher and Professor at the University of Toronto*

“Hearing stories from people who have survived suicide attempts is an important step in suicide prevention.”

* *Professor Patrick McGorry, former Australian of the Year for his services to youth mental health*

“Their stories are not only enlightening professionals who create policies or study the subject, but they are also transmitting all important hope to those at risk.""

* *Center for Suicide Prevention*

""People see stories all the time about those surviving breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke, and we know what that recovery looks like—it helps people who are experiencing it or someone whose mom just got diagnosed. So many people go through their suicidal crisis feeling completely isolated and alone because they think they're the only ones. But they're not. There are millions of healing and recovery stories—they just haven't been shared.""

* *Shelby Rowe, a youth suicide prevention program manager for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services*

***Don’t survivor stories already exist?***

When was the last time you saw an uplifting news story about someone who overcame suicide? Unfortunately, it’s human nature to take an interest in conflict, drama, and tragedy. As a result, the few survivor stories that are independently produced are unpromoted and low quality.

Of the content that does exist, ours will be different in several crucial ways:

1. ***Relevance*** \- Instead of one or two, we’ll feature 20 unique stories. This ensures every sufferer, no matter their experience, has something they can relate to.
2. ***Quality*** \- We’ve worked with award-winning production companies, many of whom are interested in pro-bono work. That means we’ll have the best equipment, crews, and directors to deliver quality films that distinguish our stories and engage our viewers.
3. ***Compelling Content*** \- We’ve learned storytelling at some of the world’s most renown advertising agencies and news organizations. Given our experience, we’re confident we can create films that are enthralling, concise, and effective.
4. ***Understanding*** *–* We understand these issues because we’ve been victims of them. Whether it’s suicide, suicide contagion, or depression, the videos we’re creating are films we wish existed when we felt lost and hopeless.
5. ***Casting*** \- Finding the right people is essential. Without a good story, we don’t have a film worth making. That’s why we won’t proceed until we’re completely satisfied.
6. ***Link to Treatment*** \- This is about more than hope. It’s about action and lasting change. That’s why we’re putting emphasis on how suicide survivors got through it, giving concrete examples of how others can too. Each film will link to treatment options and affordable resources to help people take the next step and get the help they so desperately need.

**HOW WILL THIS WORK?**

For this to work, we need news organizations to see these survivor stories and make a commitment to #ReportSurvival. Here’s why it will happen:

1. ***It’s nothing new:*** Media guidelines for how to report suicide already exist. The most effective being the suicide prevention hotline. Problem is, suicide contagion is only getting worse. This makes #ReportSurvival a simple, yet essential evolution of these guidelines.
2. ***We made it simple:*** We'll make the survivor films ourselves. All they’ll have to do is link to the film. That's one line of text alongside the suicide prevention hotline number. It’s that easy.
3. ***Broadcast quality:*** Our films will be as compelling and well produced as any broadcast segment.
4. ***Variety:*** With 20 different films, news outlets won’t have to worry about covering the same story.
5. ***Pre-launch partnership:*** We’ll partner with a news organization beforehand. When we launch they'll pledge to #ReportSurvival, which ensures others will follow.
6. ***PR:*** A well-executed PR plan is essential. In the absence of one, our survivor stories will get lost in a clutter of internet content. Our experience pitching blogs and acquiring earned media will ensure people and news organizations won’t miss our efforts.
7. ***Legitimacy:*** Along the way, we'll get endorsements from mental health organizations like NAMI and influencers like Michael Phelps.
8. ***They already care:*** Unlike the rest of the world, reporters are well aware of suicide contagion. #ReportSurvival is a chance for them to help end a life or death issue they’re painfully aware of.

With that, let’s go over how this works executionally.

1. ***Pre-Launch: The Stories***

***Casting***

First things first. We’ll partner with a casting agency to help us find the most moving survivor stories. At the same time, we’ll tap into our own networks to cast an even wider net.

***Production***

To ensure viewers have a story they can relate to, we'll produce 20 films. Each will represent a different gender, sexuality, race, age, trauma, or treatment. That means 300 million people who’re suffering from depression will finally have access to stories they can relate to.

***Partnerships***

The more help we can get the better. Whether it’s non-profits with funding, individuals with feedback, or production partners with time and equipment, we’ll take whatever we can get.

2) ***Pre-Launch: #ReportSurvival***

***Influencers***

Although it’s not essential, influencers have helped spark some of the most successful social movements in the digital age. Movements like #MeToo, Obama’s “Change” campaign, and the Ice Bucket Challenge dominated the internet because of influencer support.

Given this issue's importance, our connections, and how unaware people are, we believe we can recruit some of the world’s most influential people. Celebrities with their own survivor stories in all areas of life. Oprah, Michael Phelps, Ted Turner, Prince Harry, and J.K. Rowling are just a few examples of influencers who are just as passionate as we are.

***Bring on the News***

As proven with the existing suicide guidelines when one news organization commits to change, the rest join. Doesn’t matter if it’s Fox News or MSNBC, they all want to help end suicide contagion. So as we previously mentioned, we’ll partner with an organization beforehand.

3) ***Launch***

***Wait for it***

Every high profile suicide has lead to record-breaking global awareness, but very little action or change. By launching our campaign in reaction to the next widely publicized high profile suicide, we’ll turn awareness into action.

**WHO ARE WE?**

***I’m Tim***

I spent the last 6 years working at Ogilvy &amp; Mather. While there, I executed campaigns for American Express, British Airways, Coke Zero, ThinkPad, and Qualcomm.

I know what it's like to feel hopeless. I know suicide contagion exists because I was almost a victim of it. And I know how discouraging it is to see countless stories of people who gave up, but none of the people who beat it.

That’s why this isn’t something I *want* to do. This is something I *will do*.

***The Agency***

alcoholism,y0udontkn0wm3,2020/01/23,"Concern Someone I love has been showing signs of (what I feel is) unhealthy alcohol habits. Drinking every evening and drinking in bed by themselves. They are starting to even do it in secret. I talked with them about possibly creating drinking rules (only drinking on weekends, and never drinking alone, or even giving up drinking completely for a month or so)... But I am still scared that it will just keep getting worse. They seemed willing to agree to these rules... But, it is a lot easier to agree not to drink, until you are faced with a situation like a party or gathering where alcohol is offered freely or even given to you without asking if you want it... You know? 

I am just scared. I don't want it to get so far that it becomes a real issue, and turns into a real addiction.

alcoholism,mikro19xx,2020/01/23,"Death of gecko Today I buried my gecko, Lindsay. Lindsay is a boy btw, didn’t know the gender beforehand. I was walking in the city, wanted to show her what it was like. He fell of off me (I had heat pads so he wasn’t freezing) and got ran over. I carried him home, brains smushed out to the side, and literal guts everywhere. Some one even took a picture!!! I cried. I’m still sad right now, because he’s all I had. I don’t know what to do. I gave him a proper burial in my front yard. 

The reason I’m posting this here, is because I’m the duration of this entire situation I was drunk. And it wouldn’t of happened if I was sober. Hell, I don’t think I would have even took him out.

alcoholism,Latinhypercube123,2020/01/24,"Tachycardia (fast heart beat) after drinking I’ve been suffering from Tachycardia after drinking. Usually 4hrs after but up to 12hrs after. I’ve drank for most of my life and I’ve never had these symptoms before. Has anyone else had these symptoms ? From google searches I think it may have something to do with GABA’s (Neurotransmitters). I don’t get the DT’s and have given up for multiple weeks without much effort or side effects. I’ve been taking Ativan very infrequently for symptoms, which works well, but I’m wondering if something else is triggering it. I’ve been dieting recently too, mostly lite keto.

alcoholism,Dogsoulmate,2020/01/24,"Reaching out to share Hey folks. I have just under 4 years sober, and have learned so many tricks to live life happily clean and alcohol free. I am also powerless over my neurotransmitters, which manifests as bipolar and major depression. Again, lots of tools learned. All this said, my depression has taken a rough turn this winter. I can’t remember feeling this bad since when I was drinking. My body, mind, and spirit hurt. I feel so lost and hopeless. I know it’s not true, and I won’t always feel this way. But if I’m honest; I want to drink. Not on the edge, not gonna, but I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Reached out to support network, going to meetings, sharing, dr and therapist appointments bumped up, getting out, sleeping and eating, and all the things. It’s just EXHAUSTING to do any of it. I don’t know what the point of this was, but figured it might help someone.

I have gotten in trouble for drinking on campus multiple times so I had to see the dean of students a few days ago. He referred me to see one of the therapists on campus, which I did today. She referred me to an out patient treatment facility, but my insurance didn't cover it. Instead I'm going to start going to AA meetings on campus and try to find another affordable treatment option in town. I'm terrified. I know that I need to give up the drinking, along with other substance use, but every part of my body doesn't want to.

alcoholism,plprkr,2020/01/24,"Does length of abuse affect rapidity of dissolution of BAC? Hi reddit,

I recently just went on a heavy month long bender...needless to say I have some people who are pretty upset with me. Anyway my loved ones are going to start breathalyzing me occasionally to make sure I’m not screwing up (I.e drinking by myself or whatever)

So to get to my point: I’m currently detoxing (~25 hours without a drink) and I’m experiencing withdrawal. My question is when they breathalyze me tomorrow morning will there still be alcohol in my system due to the length of the bender? 

I really don’t want to show up and blow and have it be positive, I’m getting nervous.

Thanks all",3.7110533333333318,6.242346552000004,5.464500000000001,74.43808333333338,75.48,8.646666666666668,28.016666666666666,9.2995712137729,2.936026666666667,529,22,91,14,12,180,92,125,0.067,0.779,0.154,0.857,1,0,3,0,1,0,17.0,0,0,1,0,6,6,1,2,4,0,9,6,0,2,2,15,22,6,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,2,4,3,0,1,3,0,2,3,3,0,1,1,2,12,3,18,18,2,18,0,0,0,2,6,5,1,3,10,59,14,0,0.0,0.2451040186583123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2210783173399148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18103103870821846,0.0,0.0,0.4053025552621632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2161593363236972,0.0,0.11756749958451147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2037226995072095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1830711219834148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867058875203252,0.0,0.13808558281849806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651195694650941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14017869077964554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14341579458893608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19555653999522954,0.0,0.0,0.21045849610866116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2317388099559388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325245410742048,0.0,0.2042565815521813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16450924400227848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14642179664066332,0.0,0.16520455726870484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19497005792266014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19045569043214594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201574075308068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917681342157852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19941277269806884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Scotlost,2020/01/25,"Waster I'm not a full blown alcoholic and I don't drink every night either,sometimes I can go weeks without even thinking about it....My problem is that when I do drink I have to get absolutley smashed and sometimes I get blackouts and shit. 
I have done some really stupid stuff whilst under the influence and I don't wanna end up getting locked up,beaten up or killed just cos I was too drunk to know what the fuck I was doing.
Last night was a total disaster,I play in a band and I single handedly managed to mess up an entire gig because I drank myself into oblivion and took some speed. Now I feel like every one fucking hates me and it's horrible cos I don't even know what i did exactly. I just hope I don't lose any friends over this because I've promised them that I'll stop getting wrecked before we play. 
I'm gonna try n go a month without drinking and see how I feel cos I'm sick of it and it's depressing me,especially after last night.

alcoholism,wanderingw0man,2020/01/25,"Is it possible to control drink again? My fiancé (24m) quit drinking about three months ago. He’s had a difficult relationship with alcohol, and addiction runs in his family, so he decided to quit drinking. He’s never had a problem drinking in public, and he’s not a bad drunk, but he does have a problem drinking too much and too often at home. I’m really proud of him for stopping, and he seems healthier and happier. But he’s considering re-introducing alcohol in a controlled setting. Maybe for special occasions or in a social situation just 1 or 2 drinks. I’m worried it’s a slippery slope. Do you think it’s possible to have a drink or two after being sober 3 months?",5.1551823579304505,6.26938277099237,6.930941475826969,71.29622561492793,68.61832061068702,10.707718405428329,35.16624257845632,10.746095033038511,4.223879728583544,537,27,95,16,9,187,84,131,0.051,0.784,0.165,0.9394,0,0,9,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,0,5,7,6,0,0,8,0,7,11,0,2,1,23,11,11,0,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,3,6,10,3,3,8,0,1,2,4,0,2,2,0,4,2,14,8,1,14,0,0,0,0,13,5,0,5,7,57,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11640270324552505,0.0,0.0,0.09465137800166364,0.2282243043314268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08915434439482668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23951899531529125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09344128218611013,0.0,0.0,0.732205744801341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10065986338597313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10710604844498298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072718597024317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704567834878851,0.0,0.07849338925940069,0.0,0.08235301374366992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24075007350278324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2043423586147268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22714099001631885,0.0,0.0,0.06840408764962436,0.0,0.0,0.11463855000419533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09720578086494296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12002183453384703,0.0,0.10884571632071913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08927036264298717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06841839740350564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104305624778073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084372381009228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,snitpickle,2020/01/25,"I'm just starting my journey to recovery and could really use some help      I'm 30 years old and been drinking heavily and pretty steady for about 8-9 years. I've had some ups and downs in how much I drank. But the last 4-5 years it got really bad, but I started to admit I had a problem. My wife, gf at the time started to push me to go to AA and seek help. I would go once or twice, maybe go a day or two with out drinking, but always fall back to it.  In the last couple years I began to hide it from her, which meant I also switched to vodka and other hard drinks to hide it easier. 
     I've also battled mental health issues most of my childhood, but stop taking meds right before I started drinking. No surprise I found alcohol at that point. 
About 3 days ago I stopped drinking after a hard 3 day bender. The last day I had something happen that brought up a lot of anxiety about my past. My younger years arent full of things that I'm regretful of, but there definitely are some events that haunt me. Long story short I have slept about 5 hours(in about 20max at a time) since Thursday(it is 4:42pm sat). I've been in a constant state of high anxiety and been through about 40 heavy panic attacks. I've opened up to my wife about things that are haunting me, and the drinking I've been hiding. We have decided to move into her parents house, and out of our rented house who we share with another heavy alcoholic. 
Last night I shot awake in another panic attack but had self harm thought, so I woke my wife and we went to the ER right away. Now I have a psych evaluation on Monday, and I'm not going to be left alone till then. 
I'm terrified of the challenges ahead of me. I'm terrified I'm going to start dieng from withdrawal. I know I have an amazing family to support me. I just want to talk to people who also struggle and have my diesise.",5.2289119922630585,5.080431069148936,5.825454545454543,83.73772727272728,68.09574468085106,8.857640232108318,29.59090909090909,8.438071523408619,1.9465095744680847,1446,47,303,19,22,470,197,376,0.193,0.723,0.085,-0.9929,3,1,10,0,0,0,39.0,4,0,0,2,18,15,3,3,15,0,20,11,1,2,0,52,55,27,0,5,11,4,2,0,1,1,3,0,1,1,15,21,9,2,6,7,1,11,3,10,2,2,19,2,36,5,57,33,7,74,0,1,0,0,19,24,0,7,38,185,51,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0673587711907337,0.16241611078662532,0.0,0.07870064425972625,0.0,0.18230271232009945,0.06322809768128312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593600729413046,0.11626121374385315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17289462468078065,0.07139322105957906,0.05843007637443401,0.06344680036930313,0.0,0.0,0.06466018550224359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08211602550793166,0.0,0.06067022943584626,0.08407926925105019,0.0,0.19602387734645474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4466358269070985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163471730741315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08331691249041218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21592863862883496,0.0,0.06077453986236527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06719593150447041,0.0,0.13614063283419073,0.0,0.0,0.0807716834992828,0.0,0.0,0.10186630027663164,0.08028548693204797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17535988380674594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0793117226852495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04176101384970888,0.2477614260265503,0.0,0.0,0.08256117703802274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724698285127077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460227453142425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634015273157017,0.0,0.08440553026869732,0.0,0.07657802466081128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08076321119624964,0.055859918352337515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07130958412668416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07973661639242073,0.08092473286478911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17831107517569778,0.0843756739661871,0.0,0.07253913780768202,0.05268050676063085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07183321514085886,0.0,0.0,0.07730710734380886,0.0,0.07271024716757059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09735970855957224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12978666214181314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07927204935796307,0.0,0.0,0.06285805328056446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058499269665422474,0.0,0.0,0.2689234637628696,0.0,0.0,0.12705872980057628,0.0,0.07943914933981715,0.0,0.0,0.08623027427718218,0.0,0.0,0.057133514125107136,0.06107627062549832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009660924916883,0.0,0.0,0.060325978724152886,0.08861841992318578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422922794858045,0.0,0.0,0.06562922850362668,0.0,0.0,0.04481968721834163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0704416310629122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053979690225014094,0.0,0.0,0.24466888154474176
alcoholism,wegmanjunior,2020/01/25,"Young alcohol dependant people, what is your story. Hi there! I have noticed that a lot of the people writing stories here are pretty young, i always imagined an alcohol addiction to be something for older people, or at least middle aged. A lot of the posts i see in this subreddit are from people between the age of 19 and 25.

I'm 21 years old myself and i'm from the Netherlands (where the minimum drinking age is 18), i have been dependant on alcohol for about 2 years now, as a result of a mental disorder, it started when i was 16 and i smoked my first joint. After having a lot of severe panic attacks after smoking weed, i woke up the next day in a dream-like state which, after googling a lot, i called DPDR (depersonalisation derealisation disorder). Even though i don't really feel like living in a dream anymore, i still have a lot of difficulty with sleeping.

I get panic attacks when i'm sober and trying to sleep and i just get stressed about the thought of not being able to sleep, which makes me not able to sleep. I'm going to see a psychologist in a few days and i'm trying to reduce the amount of alcohol that i consume every day (i drink every day).

alcoholism,vapooreon,2020/01/25,"Weird joint pain after drinkimg Hi! I havent posted here in a while since Ive been able to manage my drinking better recently but these past few days something strange has been happening?? I had a full week with a party, a work event and a friends bachelorette party so I ended up drinking basically 4 days in a row (thank god Im on mini vacation from work) after the first night of heavy drinking in a while I got this INTENSE burn? Or stinging feeling in my knees and ankles and very mildly in my elbows. I hadnt done any heavy lifting or anything the night before while drinking (the bachelorette party was at a movie theater) so I wasnt dancing or anything. ANYWAY. It went away after about 2 days but it was so painful I was worried I wouldnt even be able to stand... it felt like my knees had been beaten with a bat! 

Anyway yesterday and the day before I drank 2 days in a row for the first time in a while and now again today I have the tight, creaking, burning sharp joint pain in my knees an ankles! Has anyone else ever experienced this? Its only happened to me once before a looong time ago when I had too much tequila (its been dubbed ""bone hurt juice"" since then) its not like the pain is bad enough to see a doctor or anything it just feels like my joints are extremely tight or like about to crack",4.097961282516638,5.339455057471266,4.5060657390602925,87.22313974591654,71.22222222222223,6.874047186932849,25.997378503730587,7.0608816371341465,1.0857846743295014,1034,32,207,9,19,326,144,261,0.128,0.733,0.139,-0.5728,0,0,7,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,6,15,15,1,0,21,0,22,15,5,0,1,23,32,21,0,1,9,0,6,4,1,1,5,0,0,0,10,7,5,2,3,6,0,2,5,8,0,2,17,8,19,7,27,13,4,48,0,1,1,0,2,13,0,5,35,135,29,5,0.1921317701961656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851566108556222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06532809610626387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06717150050366345,0.09843085182406212,0.2371621142755033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025706134520954,0.0,0.08021100138219789,0.0,0.0,0.24523497789510046,0.0,0.0,0.08496246865790773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3097727427793884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09832750405798224,0.0,0.09830875381824558,0.0,0.3764319789267872,0.0,0.0,0.08025072009431246,0.0,0.08508586033155002,0.09926173933609736,0.0,0.06345061108834328,0.08689709294693224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09714759592494487,0.06862948750894181,0.09223831483668853,0.0,0.0,0.1634271855782982,0.0,0.0,0.07422026452504737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768326640985531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16990148985955403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284051687939202,0.0,0.1037676408945783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18773175593454072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07061947902949893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803026509660457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10230703237813868,0.0,0.07306243451166625,0.40888349957146497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09170575740759508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09200456286061044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948534720596248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07655207273110003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589333857411982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739562117030096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08844456013960537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120335802841514,0.0,0.09105922638387157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792644160392954,0.0,0.0,0.07705825842082012,0.0,0.0,0.089054037928841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13987421698114755,0.09755956946613524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Still go out and have been fine having the occasional a non-alcoholic beer but mainly just soda water and lime. Starting to get bored of being around drunk people or being in loud, crowded bars. I already spend at least an hour or so outdoors during the day, watch and study a lot of films, cook, and put a lot into my work life. 

Any tips for making new friends and finding new activities? My grandpa has been sober 30 years and golf is his thing. Just working on finding my thing if you will.

Thanks!",3.565729386892176,5.560295565891472,4.168132487667375,86.06670190274843,73.96124031007751,6.8614517265680055,25.68076109936575,7.686295010490155,1.3853348837209298,524,18,101,7,11,166,96,129,0.044000000000000004,0.8809999999999999,0.076,0.6409,0,0,3,0,0,0,15.0,0,2,0,2,6,5,0,0,7,0,10,7,0,1,0,24,18,14,0,1,6,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,2,13,6,0,2,6,1,3,0,1,0,1,3,2,9,4,15,11,4,22,0,0,1,0,8,8,0,5,11,65,11,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18585082806891626,0.0,0.0,0.19190773911871345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11826089955047453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15481171271586616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11215389824836987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16617302818242455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31789079188948105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343580445590955,0.0,0.18171565684941712,0.0,0.1976676628868886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712607226950974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810945858916623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12283376263764947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2956944642659024,0.0,0.0,0.11608248253372865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27761753467923794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3359157476330915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12056335738042598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17482187210356176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12309037123331053,0.0,0.13888021285208202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16010773106631038,0.0,0.0,0.2310686028076999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16484095919480518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1698792492240377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532088291261667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11198867899878408
alcoholism,CJNICKOLAS666,2020/01/25,"Question about where I'm heading alcoholism runs through my mom's side of the family, and i am currently 19, started drinking at 16. i realized quickly off the bat that alcohol and me were made for each other. any social event i'd attend i'd go straight for the alcohol, just to calm myself down and give myself that euphoric bliss. i would drink maybe twice a month with friends, but i always take it a step further than the rest of my friends.  recently i've noticed i don't get that warm euphoria from drinking, and it feels like i'm chasing something i won't get, and then i black out. i feel like my tolerance is increasing even though i've only drank two days in a row like twice my whole life.

i'm currently starting antidepressants and have decided to take an extended hiatus from drinking, but i'm thinking of giving it up for good because i'm honestly kinda scared. when i start drinking i can't stop until all the alcohol is gone. drinking only 2 beers leaves me with this uncomfortable itch i feel can only be solved by drinking more. i would love to be that guy that can walk into a room with a 30 pack of beer, drink 2 throughout the night and leave buzzed while still having had a great time, but i don't know if that's possible for me.  like my mind thinks ""there's so much beer left, drink 6 and you'll be happier and more outgoing"". what do you guys think? should i stop for good? is there a way to control my binge drinking habits? i'd really like to be able to drink beers with my friends when i'm 33 and not be dependent on it. i've told myself i'll never drink by myself again. i know i have an alcohol problem, but is it fixable by anything other than sobriety?",5.593230088495574,5.608799200589972,6.057668141592924,81.8219004424779,67.31858407079646,9.611858407079646,31.994247787610608,9.3871,2.656473628318584,1335,51,272,24,20,432,184,339,0.04,0.73,0.23,0.997,2,0,22,0,0,0,30.0,0,2,0,1,13,17,0,1,15,0,26,26,2,3,2,48,55,22,0,5,7,1,4,5,3,5,7,0,1,2,15,17,22,3,11,16,0,7,6,2,0,3,6,5,32,15,37,39,8,44,0,0,1,1,14,14,0,4,27,165,47,0,0.0628952694800902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3360795770068077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05233390264242339,0.0,0.0,0.04277094001715182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05175744775784584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038340372502277495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0705423928152371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04056224561883545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7393610353358336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04154173231218576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05929206253019127,0.0,0.09540521412159862,0.08986478616729099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14577818754556798,0.0,0.06572036479366163,0.12066974712871115,0.03574483106758921,0.10550713598810163,0.0,0.06934225664160606,0.0,0.1245524103309414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06454869177225685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06913119050572097,0.0,0.0,0.1331940180388388,0.0683358943191928,0.0,0.04442478886788485,0.15363725852598611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056765436301050236,0.05951302472605662,0.0,0.0,0.06318675189154685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06350629274899533,0.07366217946034131,0.050202404043135834,0.0,0.046235259890324516,0.0,0.04850870919341824,0.0,0.0,0.059022949764663164,0.0,0.0,0.07160668117012199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14350405982699052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07090496615090935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0601822787007651,0.0,0.0,0.07045709607632472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04029232015436439,0.0,0.06210149086974238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06296913691804369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06411380664689889,0.0,0.048419851230624006,0.0,0.0,0.13355278637454984,0.0,0.050228243451931706,0.10516652309819098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457883047232618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12090224724950575,0.061794282927463286,0.0,0.03667473742419955,0.0,0.0,0.06009912530578615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061439539241953486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049923337379476566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0702203222549579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08935798977043435,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Gurowhore,2020/01/25,"Think I’m becoming an alcoholic and don’t know how to stop myself So sorry if this isn’t allowed here. I just didn’t really know where to turn too. I wouldn’t consider myself an alcoholic, at least not yet. But I think I’m getting there and I’m not sure what to do about it. 

I don’t drink every day or even super often. But the dependency is what’s there. I have a very addictive personality and smoke, have been dependent on many medications etc. And have drank a few times when I was younger, and now that I’m older it’s only gotten worse. 

At this point I don’t know what to consider myself. I don’t drink every day, but I want too, if I could drink every day I would. When I get drunk, I never want to be sober again, I cry and feel depressed when sobering up because I don’t wanna be sober. If we have booze in the house, I’ll try and steal it. If I have extra money, I wanna buy booze. If there’s booze in the house I’ll also use any excuse I can to drink and plan my days around when I can drink, I want to be drunk constantly. 

I don’t know what to do... I can’t seem to get myself out of this thinking pattern and I have nowhere to turn because if I’m not heavily drinking every day I can’t use the resources for alcoholics. So I thought maybe an online community could offer some support and guidance. 

Does it sound like I’m slipping into alcoholism? How would you get yourself out of this rut? I can’t exactly get therapy or anything, which I need anyways since I have ptsd and a slew of other mental issues. I really don’t know where to turn and I’m feeling pretty lost and am struggling to not just let myself fall into the pit and start drinking daily.

alcoholism,SirIanGibbonsIV,2020/01/25,"The IPA “hobby” has done me dirty. I’m a 24 year old dude. I’d say I’ve been drinking for about 5 years. Originally, I was drinking crappy beers with my buddies around camp fires a bunch of nights a week during the summer. The summer before we went of to college. 

From that, stemmed an overall interest in beer. That led to the IPA’s. Before I knew it, I was drinking 8% DIPA’s in my dorm alone. A four pack every night. I chalked it up to a “hobby.” An interest in microbrews such as Lawsons, Alchemist, Trillium, etc. 

That “hobby” just allowed me to get messed up every night. 

I’m having a hard time shaking the addiction. It’s not the hobby I thought. I know this, because the mornings following are mostly composed of shaky hands, anxiety, a general feeling of malaise, and just a general feeling that I’m not myself. 

I’ll go days without drinking. Generally, about two. The maximum? About five. 

It’s caused fights with my loved ones. Which always ends with me feeling okay again. With me saying I can drink responsibly for sure.. this time. 

The thing I’ve noticed, is that I’m in legitimate pain? I feel pain in my flank. It dissipates with the days after my alcohol use. Perhaps it’s my anxiety, but that scares me. 

I’m not in control. It’s time I get in control of my life. I have so much ahead of me, and it’s time I quit numbing myself to it. “Hobby” or not.",0.943412198827872,3.4424241845018493,2.8890091165617555,88.54632895593662,87.59778597785976,5.69746038636857,24.20675059691773,7.1686216300943375,1.2434019101367486,1058,44,210,17,34,353,145,271,0.105,0.8490000000000001,0.046,-0.8948,1,1,8,0,1,0,47.0,1,0,0,4,9,13,1,3,20,1,10,15,1,7,1,38,29,6,0,0,9,0,7,0,0,0,6,2,1,0,19,9,8,2,7,7,0,5,5,8,0,4,7,9,27,5,36,22,4,35,0,0,0,1,5,10,0,3,20,133,46,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11505008992326908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11278615532073395,0.0,0.10930372663560008,0.0,0.0,0.08781461409434246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16146988433084775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394963722930452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433391827330635,0.0,0.17960715078824713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10841479975371916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23673575596634355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13612430053823432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10800022486020176,0.0,0.516926733246801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09347379242768553,0.0,0.11770081567829235,0.0,0.0,0.17783768424953306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2134491954586208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102766692544824,0.0,0.059978682796022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09453975031130032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05799996283118058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07454337425035767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09525058577673992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07758128669596327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29711586340355034,0.0,0.0,0.12015371978839495,0.11074254096627366,0.0,0.0715140941054909,0.0,0.22459602110808494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11225079228408076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16785332337417416,0.10566019691085214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994666663847792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0701135948567049,0.0,0.0,0.08378399375904637,0.2461561436319659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10309358095325337,0.0,0.0,0.0911494349143044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08465481367173562,0.0,0.0,0.09783316080687356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101733178653979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13592376934728534
alcoholism,T-Saxon242,2020/01/25,"I want to be sober. Has anyone had success with tapering off their intake? I’ve been drinking daily for a few years now. I started drinking because I had trouble sleeping and it turned into a daily routine. I still have a little trouble sleeping, but I just like getting a buzz now before I go to bed. 
I’m going to start tapering off slowly, because I’m admittedly scared shitless of severe withdrawal symptoms. I’m somewhat neurotic, and always suffered with nocturnal anxiety. Jerking awake, bad dreams, and stuff like that. 
Anyway, wish me luck, everyone.

alcoholism,Larry409,2020/01/25,"34, and think I have a problem. I quit drinking when I turned 22 because I got a wicked bacterial infection in my stomach from sushi. I couldn’t eat, definitely couldn’t drink, lost a BUNCH of weight..etc etc I didn’t touch alcohol again until I was 29. 

Well, I’m 34 now, and I’ve been drinking a pint of liquor a day for five years (sometimes more, sometime less. Depends on the day.) 
I just fell into this routine of drinking every day after my dinner had settled, and now I’m wondering if I could be physically addicted at this point. 
My friends and family offer different opinions, with some saying “you’re an alcoholic”, while others maintain “Much of the world drinks daily. Even Winston Churchill drank a quart a day”..etc 

My typical choice is vodka, chased with plenty of water. I don’t do mixed drinks that often, and like to keep hydrated when I drink. I’m just wondering if at this point I *do* have a problem, because the thing is, I don’t want to give up my evening/night liquor, but I also don’t want to suffer seizures or severe withdrawal symptoms if I decided to get completely sober. 

I’m considering just reducing my intake each night until I can reach a better level of  consumption, as a pint (or more) each night is a bit much, if even taken slow with plenty of water.  

Any suggestions, comments, or advice is most welcome.

alcoholism,Indigo1979,2020/01/25,Please help me make sense of this. Can someone NOT technically be an alcoholic but still go through a massive personality change after a drink or two? Is that even a ‘thing’? Anyone else affected like this?

alcoholism,northern_spaces,2020/01/25,"What support can I offer my dad before/during/after his rehab stay? My dad is going into rehab on Tuesday. I’ve made up a selection of books I think he’ll like, bought him a new shirt, I’m going to get him some chocolates/sweet treats that he likes etc. 

Beyond these material things what can I do to offer him support? I’ve wanted this to happen so badly for years and now that the time is here I don’t know what to do and I’m terrified that he’ll just relapse after the 4 weeks are over. 

For context we live separately (but within 2 mins of each other) and I am 20. I also have a brother who is 30 and their relationship is strained, I haven’t asked him yet if he is going to see our dad before Tuesday (he has bad anger management issues concerning our family/any mention of alcoholism). 

He is distant from his own relatives and they are a trigger for his drinking, I am almost completely cut off from them. 

Any help no matter how small is really appreciated. Thank you so much 😊",3.9964393395549176,4.9870490351758825,5.667139267767407,79.74920854271356,71.2110552763819,8.29877961234745,26.27458722182341,8.634040054169528,1.848663747307968,774,24,151,13,14,265,127,199,0.113,0.7829999999999999,0.10400000000000001,-0.5711,0,0,2,0,0,0,21.0,3,1,3,0,9,11,2,1,6,0,19,5,1,3,0,20,38,11,0,2,3,4,0,2,0,2,3,0,0,0,11,8,2,0,2,2,1,3,3,5,0,0,2,1,24,6,21,34,5,22,0,0,1,0,31,8,0,3,12,102,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18285056930365085,0.1713288464704927,0.0,0.0,0.1368261419054366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2327035400794405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15995252006924215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857175562654221,0.0,0.0,0.1455908736282648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793918611655083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16760984039869645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1908182887613992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939107684250344,0.0,0.2917149608694812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15130043775796825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11468265622312013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785807279242569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09403039045983276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16717862143202886,0.0,0.15108171146423055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16189603886464773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12577591991965706,0.0,0.0,0.1652464676401548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096090655731999,0.0,0.0,0.1836940565451048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136342090055474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823665472814117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3883175053614478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575230526523927,0.0,0.0,0.11366918837703482,0.10963199517880393,0.0,0.0,0.09976798764152453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009173940219753,0.0,0.13724362560415904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11018080426791656
alcoholism,YouOldPear,2020/01/25,"Unquenchable Does anyone else ever get a thirst that lasts all day, and no matter what you drink, your mouth feels parched non-stop? Because there's really only one (or two) things to drink that'll make that thirst go away?

This has happened to me a few times in the past, but today is awful. I've been chugging water and coffee since 7am and it's just not quenching it one bit.

I'm just venting because I want to jump out the window and run to the gas station for a 12 pack, but it's been a month since I had my last beer. I'm trying to hold strong. But damn, I'm so thirsty, you know?",3.678629032258062,3.96043525,4.253387096774194,92.1750806451613,71.5,6.845161290322581,23.56451612903225,5.985473137389443,0.3057129032258068,457,10,105,2,8,145,89,124,0.08199999999999999,0.86,0.059000000000000004,-0.5775,0,0,3,0,0,0,16.0,0,3,0,1,5,2,1,0,7,1,6,7,3,1,2,20,16,9,0,1,7,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,9,5,6,1,2,3,0,3,2,1,0,3,3,1,7,1,9,12,3,14,0,0,0,0,3,3,1,1,8,57,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13231069577005436,0.1938836320824856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17778335298753453,0.0,0.0,0.2306999143531283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2065849660632515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122034633201334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16559229302321407,0.0,0.0,0.3707374159312199,0.0,0.0,0.15807341703118974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17116507360999972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956779728965302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988623840851667,0.0,0.10754107129984226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16733126524738276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10399324972554876,0.30848767156208223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12630932493966826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15103779067854134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25644785562554234,0.14391433081601876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18063691413379948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212225416973782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31305816738992603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1582007834569666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12571284916702508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11033876603811964,0.0,0.17936341318556445,0.0,0.0,0.1284715249055452,0.0,0.18484557551145814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11160995617328576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,sub_human_sam,2020/01/25,"I think I blacked out for three days. I went to some people close to me but they said I’d been acting normally. But I don’t remember last Thursday through Saturday at all. 

I go to this bar near my university campus every Friday night to unwind. I started in September and I remember going home drunker and drunker every week trying to kill some thoughts that were haunting me. Last week I completely lost a whole weekend. Some of the students I study with said they’d seen me on campus and I didn’t say anything or acknowledge them. One said I was with a man they’d never seen before in an area I didn’t usually go to. I’ve never blacked out before. I’m healthy. I mean no kidneys missing, no diseases. But I’m definitely freaked out. I am a very private person and I’m terrified of what might’ve come out about me. Has this ever happened to any of you?

alcoholism,dum33ich,2020/01/26,"starting over hi everyone! 

I am deciding today to quit drinking. I don’t drink often, but when I do I drink to black out. last night I got drunk at a work event (everyone else was and my husband and father were with me and assured I didn’t embarrass myself) but after that I went out and acted incredibly irresponsibly. this isn’t the first time i’ve done this, and my husband for the first time was genuinely worried and upset with me. now that it’s effecting my loved ones, I think it’s time to stop for good. 

I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and self medicate with alcohol when i’m feeling sad. I hate the post drinking anxiety, it’s all consuming. any tips or tricks? 

thank you.",4.40422222222222,5.8318307925925925,5.670555555555558,78.45250000000003,70.7037037037037,9.844444444444443,30.537037037037038,10.125756701596842,3.1985703703703714,547,23,105,15,10,183,86,135,0.231,0.655,0.114,-0.9505,0,0,5,0,0,0,16.0,0,1,0,5,4,10,2,2,4,0,10,9,0,1,2,24,19,13,0,0,3,3,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,7,13,6,1,4,5,0,2,3,6,0,3,7,2,17,4,13,12,1,22,0,2,1,1,7,4,0,2,15,70,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15466449194982576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09841635970392898,0.0,0.22142485089778288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12464939998828127,0.14689043582899433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14810150998559055,0.0,0.5670923729639857,0.0,0.0,0.12089719747004675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2765773738717853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07317611651630995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24620201169053155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12138648627517146,0.11574791793464374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14288364752455562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179682695748811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13061783527587412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14579283680314695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13581239627879566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09806780806229366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386042865563379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15393034464391558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15097727904441988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10243543130007447,0.0,0.0,0.12099460944618667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13324116518559578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09273242571980828,0.0,0.0,0.2531668101477133,0.0,0.1371801431895292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341593395839343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053598074351512,0.14697286854222275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,2c0l1s0,2020/01/26,"Reaching Out I always thought being an alcoholic meant that you drank everyday. So how could I be an alcoholic? Yes, I drink a lot and don't remember parts of nights sometimes and sure I had that DUI in 2014, but I don't do that anymore, well not as much, and I don't drink much now so how do I get so drunk some nights, so ya, how could I, ME be an alcoholic? 

That's always what I said. I went to an AA meeting once and left thinking no way. Me? No. Not me. 

But today. Looking at the damage I did last night. Not remembering the damage. Realizing I've had this feeling too many times. Realizing I've been hungover too many times to count and wasted days because I can't get up to do anything without having to vomit. Realizing I am hating myself.

Realizing I AM an alcoholic. And it hurts to admit it. It hurts so bad. 

I'm a 27 year old female. Bonus mom. Have a good job. Great family. Great relationship. Great friends. And I'm an alcoholic. 

I'm ready to admit it. Face it.

Someone got married, let's drink. I'm feeling sad, let's drink. I'm feeling happy, bored, excited, lets drink. Oh I had such a shitty last 10 years, lets drink. Don't worry about the fact that the reason that the last 10 years have sucked is because your drinking, just drink.

I have tried AA but in those meetings it is usually other veterans. And we end up talking about war stories. Then I get home, I'm paranoid, I can't sleep. So let's drink...

The longest amount of sobriety I have really had was about 6 months after I tried to kill myself a few years after my deployment and landed in the hospital recovering. Tried that while I was still serving. When I got out of the hospital my squad leader told me that I didn't need to report for duty, 2 weeks later I was standing in front of an LTC and getting my discharge paperwork. Honorable with medical conditions.

Ive been hiding ever since. This was a couple of years ago now. I bought some hiking gear and just disappeared into the mountains. I just keep moving and moving. Ive lived in 3 states in the last 15 months.

I just want to quit drinking. I'm trying. I really feel like I'm trying. Everyday I fight myself, telling myself to just fucking stop it. And I always find an excuse. Oh I haven't slept in 2 days, just fucking drink.

I'm sorry. I don't mean to be so pathetic. I'll probably delete this in a bit. I just needed to reach out for a second and try to stop myself. Try to remind myself that I'm still alive.

alcoholism,sickdoughnut,2020/01/27,"wow, kindling? It's been a couple of years since I was drinking every day and rattling when I didn't; the years prior to that were a nightmare of dependency scattershot with a few cold turkeys and medical detoxes, until I ended up in rehab.  Following that, I've binged pretty regularly every two weeks, up until the beginning of this year, where it seems like my drinking has started to escalate and I'm drinking now every five days-ish.  I drank on Friday and this time I'm getting the shakes...last night was pretty bad and I'm still rattling hard this morning, though it's day three so I guess this should be the worst of it.  But I'm a bit perturbed given that I'm not drinking every day that I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  Is this due to kindling and how should I be approaching it?  I'm really reluctant to try any kind of tapering as I'm pretty sure this will just lead me back into dependent daily drinking; it only ever escalated the problem in the past.",5.819556737588653,6.5493936861702124,6.8391489361702105,73.93333333333334,66.92553191489364,9.458156028368792,32.687943262411345,9.516144504307137,3.130477304964539,775,32,136,15,12,260,113,188,0.08800000000000001,0.807,0.105,0.5052,0,0,5,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,1,10,7,0,0,10,0,12,10,0,4,2,22,28,14,0,3,3,0,1,1,0,3,4,0,0,0,16,8,6,0,1,5,0,3,2,3,0,3,7,3,8,4,19,16,3,32,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,4,23,88,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07858549413996757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885933394731657,0.09648867110451806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261627644570162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278661321020357,0.0,0.2235820008237817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5660292974467036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10235281260306003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10453160884182856,0.3894607610756019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06037589237339318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12730355320187242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352002519464057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033907717990106,0.0,0.094197700313933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056457304303963576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11641562598647465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10844624109253824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08788940534603737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11031612263172696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527014764079762,0.0,0.11057634244822034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07403138411516623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10520246302074296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09559331587969364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08179472407203538,0.0,0.09228722421975644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10891494610757904,0.12011220505397907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113538170003565,0.0,0.06738459247747454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07845838467804757,0.0,0.11288637914258225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09269612427882816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22325263152878685
alcoholism,u011,2020/01/27,"Day zero, starting today. I've decided, no more, i don't want to drink anymore. I've been drinking i think minimum 2 beers  a day, 15 years at least. Occasionally harder stuff, but mostly beer. It hasn't impacted my life too much (so i think), i go to work everyday, haven't skipped a day because of a drink ... but i feel it having a bad effect on my health and mental state. Most i've been without drink has been 2 months , maybe few times total. I don't know how deep i am and how easy or hard it is to get out, but i am gonna try anyway. A few months ago i tried a system where i would drink my 2 beers every third day so 2 days off between drinks. It worked like a month, but eventually, yet again, back to my old pattern. So now i am thinking all or nothing.

alcoholism,ok_byside,2020/01/27,"Sleepwalking, or as I like to call it, drunkwalking So this one’s a bit personal, but I’m sure most of us have been there at one point or another. 
I’m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences before. 

Something used to happen when I drank a lot and I’ve never known if this is common thing or not.

A few years ago I was going through a pretty bad rough patch, won’t go into the details but it was some messed up stuff. 
On the nights that I was emotionally distraught, I would drink my normal amount (not actually that much since during that time my tolerance was still building) and eventually would go to bed. 


It was completely different than blacking out.
I remember going to bed, I would usually remember going to sleep too, but ONLY on those nights, I would get back up at some point during the night and I guess sleepwalk. 
When I woke up in the morning I would find that things were knocked over, and almost always a suspicious wet spot on the floor....or in my bed.

I soon realized I had been either urinating on the floor or wetting the bed, and on one occasion, my sister heard me “ricocheting” down the hall, found me laying on the stairs, tried to wake me up, and just went back to bed after giving up.

Another time I burst into my mother’s room “flailing like a fish” and just...didn’t know how to get back out. 

I don’t remember these things, and I always woke up in my bed like normal. I’d also gotten significantly more drunk on different nights and had nothing of this sort happen at all.

The reason why I’m so curious is because it has recently been brought to my attention that I have some neurological problems that have apparently been there since my childhood, specifically possible (most likely) seizures.
So a lot of experiences from my past have come to light as being definitely not normal. 
For example blacking out, drug like sensations....

Not asking for any medical advice, just personal experiences.

alcoholism,jessicacanes,2020/01/27,"Withdrawal Experience (DT's) NIGHTMARE If you have experienced the DT's (aka delirium tremens) you will KNOW it. It is the absolute worst feeling in the world. It is as if you are trapped in your own body panicking, sweating, shaking, facing hallucinations and insomnia. Also my heart beat was so rapid that I was sure I would have a heart attack. Well as a daily vodka drinker for two years, I finally faced the worst state of DT's. I couldn't leave my bed and was hearing / seeing the  most DEMONIC things ever. I tried to detox at home for fear of paying for ER bills, but I just had to check myself into the hospital. When I arrived to the hospital I was even hearing whispers through the ceiling from a demonic presence. When I tell people about my experience of being in the presence of (you know who) it is as if they dont believe me or think it was just a 'hangover' , but this experience was truly terrifying and life-altering. The hallucinations, the whispers.. I truly see it as a spiritual warning which was terrifying. Has anyone else been through this???? What was your experience like?

alcoholism,gjfarma,2020/01/27,"Does the desire to drink ever disappear? I'm trying to quit drinking for the umpteenth time. I've lost count how many. 

I have a question for you successful quitters. Do you still have a desire deep down to drink? For those of you that no longer have the desire, and quit without looking back, how did you get this mentality?

I remember seeing a comment about how this person had taken up running and that had provided them with the necessary stimulation to not look back. 

Personally I find quitting so hard because I'm weak and  I give into my desire. I wish I didn't have the desire.

alcoholism,thatGuyinVA757,2020/01/27,"Fully functional Well, tonight I had the thought that I might actually have problem. I’m drunk as I type this. I drink a 6 pack + a night or if I have liquor more than 375ml a night if I can. I think about drinking during work but haven’t yet. I’m married, have a 4 year old, great job that I enjoy, but yet I’m an alcoholic: it’s in my blood according to my mother, she has it and stopped drinking, my uncle was one and so was my grand father. I started almost 2 years ago drinking nightly every day. Now I’m drinking more and usually it’s 3 or 4 beers. I’m not sure what to do, I know the first step is admitting you have a problem. But well fuck I don’t know. I don’t think I have a problem but my mother had said something and so has my wife. Yeah I drink after work every day and ok the weekends, so what. I pay bills, make sure my family is good, my work is fine and excellent, but what? Fuck. I have a feeling I’ll start slipping too eventually but I don’t stop. I love it unfortunately and it’s in my blood.

Be safe everyone.

alcoholism,National-Skill,2020/01/27,"My 32 year old gf gets black out drunk a lot, I’m 25 male. So I met her in Dec 2019 been together since till she wanted space a couple days ago. She’s been black out drunk 4 times this month, 3 times in less than two weeks. I’ve discovered from people that’s she’s had this issue before, and she’s always hateful towards me and never remembers anything the next day. She says things completely opposite of who I am, even her drinking “friends” say I’m such a mature young guy and great to her and for her. This last Thursday we went to a local bar and she was drinking prior when I met here there after work, and she had about 9 drinks while I was present, friends told her she needs to go home, I pull my truck up, keep in mind I’ve had one drink the whole night. I don’t drink much, alcoholism is in my family, not going down that road, I try to get her to the truck and she shoved me out of the way to get another drink. A friend of hers brought her back outside to the truck. We get to her home, she shoved me to the ground when I help her out and told me to get the fuck out of the way, it’s pitch dark and I’m shaking and anxious at this point, she ends up cooking food on a gas stove I’m next to her watching her, she eats I get her to bed... ends night... so I thought. I wake up to a crash, and btw she lives at her parents at 32 and is a bartender. Anyways her rooms lights are on and she’s nowhere to be seen, I see the back porch light on and glad door wide open, she isn’t there, I turn around and she’s face down on the ground knocked out, with the lights on, and the gas stove on high. Open flame and all, her parents never woke surprisingly, and she cussed at me and said she needed to eat, she already did... she gets back in bed. Wakes up no memory. She was blacked out drunk for over 6 hours continually, and didn’t understand why I was upset, and she’s the one who told me we need space... seriously? She says that I shouldn’t be her DD anymore and that I shouldn’t be around people that get drunk then, and that she never black out drinks... are you kidding me? She did three times in less than two weeks. And also, should I tell her parents about what happened? They saw the mess she left but are unaware of the gas stove problem.. if I decided to go home when I got her home the house could have burned down with them in it?

alcoholism,carlengland12345,2020/01/28,"First post here. Hi everyone, I recently had a terrible evening when I was drunk. I have been with my girlfriend for 9 months, we have great times together when we aren’t drinking and make wonderful and exciting plans. We do some of them but some plans fall through. We tend to argue a lot when we are drunk, usually over silly things. We were on holiday last week and actually had a physical fight, involved grabbing, biting and scratching and I said things i wish I could take back. I don’t even remember saying them. When I see her now my heart bleeds and I feel terrible. We were best friends for two years before we dated and I really want her back, she broke up with me after what happened. She said I need to change, I’m just asking here for any advice. I will do anything and everything to get her heart and trust back. So I’m just asking for any tips or advice or websites or groups I can talk to. Thank you in advance",3.0772745901639347,5.067473322404375,3.8301878415300585,87.97347848360658,75.33879781420765,7.635109289617486,25.09870218579235,8.472884824447931,1.6270767759562843,730,25,149,14,16,232,113,183,0.106,0.72,0.174,0.9272,1,0,1,0,1,0,19.0,8,1,2,5,15,12,2,0,3,0,16,6,2,1,0,36,34,18,0,4,6,0,3,0,2,1,1,3,0,0,3,19,3,0,3,4,0,2,2,5,0,2,8,7,32,7,17,24,4,25,0,1,1,0,29,4,0,7,18,105,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.13120865623687647,0.0,0.0,0.2627756828826601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18286798174050167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11064498474573156,0.0,0.2513944954114918,0.0,0.0,0.3101627196389937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114411277160409,0.0,0.14110219674834554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14223553112058845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735135356407782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13171468394118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.177612480410466,0.0,0.0,0.12847748663732175,0.12083945813945653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06798447320751272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11436732956223515,0.0,0.0,0.1038795769883166,0.0,0.07024717287162124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14823708008635456,0.0,0.0,0.11889808672360001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3186595757868115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959874675041813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11430880810496825,0.0,0.0,0.0897497371365328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10732067499811747,0.0,0.0,0.0996966572505142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12877069533657926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861352972756269,0.0,0.13275806299641646,0.0,0.1523112716009664,0.0,0.2557949344111968,0.10692398948803468,0.0,0.0,0.1071432038645168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010934049901382,0.10806981254663382,0.0,0.12378807261080788,0.0,0.0,0.17865181644845754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07840177479074288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13134296949911373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14808315479249945,0.0,0.07930502544572188,0.0,0.10785166745814788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15461658098126593,0.0,0.14581068047732534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865845929810128

alcoholism,RisusSardonicus4622,2020/01/28,"First post here. Relapsed, now two days sober. Alcoholic for 5 1/2. I’ve been drinking for 5 1/2 years. I’ve relapsed three times now. My bf let me know it was becoming an issue and affecting our relationship last weekend. I was drinking every weekend to “wind down from the week”. Do you guys have any stories, any tips? This is hard. I have my bf and he’s awesome, understanding, loving but he’s not an alcoholic. I need some help from other alcoholics. AA Isn’t enough for me it seems. The people there aren’t very friendly, just avoidant. After the meeting they all get in their cars ASAP and leave. Thanks guys in advance.",1.4104117647058845,4.115053766666667,2.306274509803924,91.10029411764708,90.5,5.156862745098039,22.89215686274509,6.794906146795322,0.8988186274509795,492,19,95,7,17,154,87,120,0.019,0.84,0.141,0.9504,1,1,5,0,0,0,22.0,1,1,2,2,5,4,0,1,5,0,10,6,0,1,1,14,17,4,0,1,3,0,1,0,3,0,3,0,0,2,4,3,5,1,3,4,0,2,3,1,1,3,3,1,11,3,10,13,3,17,0,0,0,1,15,3,0,2,11,56,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5064316590211888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2148356083172844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17445373975194065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187074107727212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094801394918553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1632142785717697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13308760165770211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343601793177352,0.0,0.0,0.12203903549226075,0.0,0.08252726350892782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3128092675786564,0.0,0.0,0.1415005900840951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587685174331724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16486856755274945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08681035160811769,0.1287579881662967,0.0,0.16725619005639286,0.0,0.1615241818101463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425645196743596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712488869706962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950915442911513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15128143485135068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16958927384029032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438002991956962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14542778691299468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921073925572476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543033749373474,0.164441299248603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13033304238667046,0.0,0.0,0.12670549740787607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10172067043631892
alcoholism,geegeelapee,2020/01/28,"Alcoholic going to an alcohol free wedding for a weekend I’m going to a wedding next month, because it’s in a different country I’ll be staying for a week. The wedding its self is two nights and three days in a venue in the countryside. The venue is alcohol free and there won’t be any shops near by. I’m worried about how I will cope. I usually drink every night and I get withdrawal symptoms when I’m not drinking. I shake a lot and sweat profusely and struggle to sleep or stay asleep. I’ve never had a seizure or anything extreme like that. I’m also a painfully shy person and will be giving a speech at the wedding... sober... so that’s freaking me out too. 

Advice please. 

Do I sneak as many hip flasks in as I can? Take it on the chin and look a shaken mess all weekend?",2.2887601078167137,4.114965427672956,3.7562668463611857,88.36033018867926,77.11320754716981,6.5554357592093435,27.709344115004487,7.447530270364453,1.5476249775381854,609,26,125,8,14,201,103,159,0.11199999999999999,0.7809999999999999,0.107,-0.1829,1,0,5,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,2,16,0,11,11,4,1,2,15,21,15,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,3,5,1,0,2,5,8,5,0,0,5,3,3,3,5,0,2,1,2,7,5,17,14,2,24,0,0,1,0,7,8,0,3,12,77,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14281111644500735,0.0,0.46855339579490707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11687203320806233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993835515825409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12026481010143285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08908858179749843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942513778782193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15269032752739845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2863327513336271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12313339141443205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07635468453434778,0.14019551631796284,0.16611504263363752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07139902186668988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12272491841984197,0.0,0.0,0.12424717786583163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14816800226789892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166514743371964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11271596556898852,0.0,0.1554267717334364,0.2742941992922204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15550849019390825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276080999579194,0.0,0.16042322672112422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15246101608352575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14625045596043226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3115420616718559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15278239333095844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15190052130249018,0.10988278575469047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14276234319403774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16095797320834349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11722863296320735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14841725202945974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Respectmyauthoritaah,2020/01/28,"My mom died tonight My mom died tonight

I am lost. I can’t describe the feeling. I felt disassociated like I was floating above my body but wasn’t in control. She wanted this. She wanted us to feel this way. I’ve never felt grief like this before. I couldn’t look at her body. But the yellow sheet will be engrained in my memory for life. She drank herself to death. Her brain was gone long before. She said things to make us feel guilty and we do. I’m filled with regret and what ifs. I’m the youngest but I took control tonight. I picked the mortuary. I didn’t think I would come to this but it has. I’m starting to feel the grief now. I can’t sleep. I feel guilty to even be laying in my bed alive. She will never meet my daughter my beautiful 4 month old. All she needed to do was admit she needed help. I’ll never understand. I’ll always feel angry. Now I have to deal with going through her apartment. What the f. This is the torture of alcohol abuse.

alcoholism,Imagine-An-Orange,2020/01/28,"Am I an alcoholic? You guys probably get this question on here a lot but its a question that I have been struggling with for a long time now. I truly don't know the answer to it. Am I 28 year old female an alcoholic? 

I don't drink too often which is why I also struggle with this question. I can turn down drinks sometimes but lately its been a bit harder to do so. As soon as I get the first drink in its like I can't stop and I want to continue I drink to get drunk! I'm scared to go out with friends when I know alcohol will be involved. I literally try to meditate and tell myself don't drink, you will not drink, but to no prevail because once I'm out there and its in front of me I give in. 

Lately, I have been drinking to the point of blacking out. I don't know how I get home (I don't drive) and when I wake up my apartment is a mess. Everything is on the floor and its like a tornado passed by most of the mess being in the bathroom. And I am so sick for the next few days i need to cancel everything including work!

Its taken me like an hour to write this with the in between visits to the bathroom (being sick) and just sitting here thinking that this is not me ...  I'm at lost .. I don't know what to do..

alcoholism,MiserableInspector,2020/01/28,"Do alcoholics ever just stop or permanently cut down? So, my dad used to drink maybe a lot, I don’t know. About 4/5 beers every week day and easily 10 a day on the weekend. I think that’s a bit much.

But my Mom, (has never drunk alcohol) her father was a very violent alcoholic and it worried her how much my dad would drink. 

He cut down a bit and eventually stopped drinking. For about 10 years, however now he’s drinking socially  maybe once a month. 

Did he have a problem? I don’t know how much people normally drink. He never would drive when under the influence and never spent the last of our money on beer.",2.6079955290611068,4.617134926229512,4.2108643815201185,84.62690760059614,76.78688524590164,8.042921013412817,24.205663189269746,8.841846274778883,1.8251377049180328,479,16,97,11,11,160,80,122,0.146,0.8170000000000001,0.037000000000000005,-0.9065,1,0,10,0,0,0,17.0,1,0,0,0,9,4,3,0,10,0,9,11,0,4,4,25,14,10,0,4,3,4,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,2,4,11,2,3,9,2,1,5,4,0,0,3,0,9,0,10,9,6,21,0,0,0,0,12,5,0,2,15,60,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3717998177907879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532114845734978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495780222111178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.568016717671896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10489863619274713,0.09770705516748966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12746467301287726,0.09452844364403093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09859085113056378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23300853376553105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13581894872114592,0.09256361663971494,0.0,0.255746888219634,0.0,0.26832230330696183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11362287047813005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12350088829724012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08039679774732397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096459383450144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11821357827161252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19390692364111364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430686158420763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001581065704957,0.0,0.0956847790778729,0.0,0.0,0.09302159533309992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11776994416601427,0.0,0.16475901635505413,0.0,0.0,0.0746788358509747

As the title says, I may come off as judgmental, even like a dick, but I have attended smart and aa groups and just can't relate to the attendees. I have higher education and work in a fast paced professional career. While I don't diminish the struggle of attendees or the earnestness of their shares, I cannot engage in their stories (often rambling) nor can I relate to their circumstances. This makes it very challenging for me to find what I'm looking for in these two organizations.

What I want to know is, realistically, if I’m drinking 6-7 beers every other weekend, will I end up with long term brain damage?",4.695925925925927,4.8759541481481525,6.461333333333332,77.592,69.24691358024691,9.442962962962962,29.78024691358025,9.3871,2.444627654320987,310,11,64,6,5,108,65,81,0.079,0.7829999999999999,0.138,0.5733,0,0,4,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,0,1,0,7,7,3,1,0,6,12,5,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,5,1,4,0,1,4,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,8,1,7,9,2,11,0,2,0,0,1,4,0,1,7,37,13,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4215156066351947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15770898178896675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202175502439819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6604556485192672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19319098601317308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17466976424368344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661581582107083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10838160698039802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745248832375941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2069390041844099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19726363805001768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15749237648880085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2257585771781697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14827758003196911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11631972687647127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12699694818400878
alcoholism,Uhhuhhhoneyy,2020/01/28,"Reassurance Alcohol is ruining my life. It started with using it to numb my anxiety/thoughts in my head/loneliness and now it’s a full blown obsession. I spent all day in bed today recovering from getting too drunk by myself and I wish I could say that doesn’t happen often..but I am so so so fucking DONE. I started researching rehab facilities, listening to sober podcasts and am dead serious about stopping...the thing that is the hardest about this all though is no one knows. They just think I’m depressed, which I am, but they don’t know why. I have no one to talk to about this. I guess I’m hoping for some reassurance from someone who has been this low, that things can and will get better.

alcoholism,valeriantincture,2020/01/28,"just wanted to share my story/situation I'm 22, female and live in Australia. I have been diagnosed in the last few months (several times by diff psychiatrists) with substance abuse disorder (pertaining just to alcohol, not other drugs), PTSD and BPD. I've been in complete denial about the ""substance use disorder"" diagnosis and was never willing to accept that my drinking was a problem. I even directly told this to the first psychiatrist who diagnosed me. I felt this way because I've been socialising for so long with people who drink heavily (but only socially) multiple times a week, and go on weekend benders. A lot of these people would drink from friday - sunday straight and take dexys to stay up.

Anyway, the thing that I've been in denial about is how physically reliant I feel towards alcohol and how often I drink alone, in the mornings, to avoid cravings. It's recently gotten out of hand and I don't feel remotely in control. I make so many excuses to myself about why it's ok for me to drink in that instance. I know I'm drinking to self medicate my PTSD symptoms. I'm a victim of pretty extreme child sexual abuse which I reported to the police 6\~ ish months ago, and making this reported ""triggered"" me to mentally spiral. I was drinking a lot before I made this report but would rarely drink in the mornings. Lately I've been showing up to work drunk, stealing my housemates' alcohol because I find it impossible to resist the temptation to drink when it's available to me. I can never have just one drink, or even just three. I always end up drinking until I throw up or pass out. 

I had an inpatient stay at a psych hospital for reasons not related to my drinking, and my GP thinks I now need to go back but this time for a detox/rehab program. I know my drinking isn't as bad as other peoples' stories I've read on here but I know it's only getting worse and worse and I'm trying very hard to get it in control before I spiral further. I don't want to go inpatient for my drinking because it would mean my family would know, and I feel very ashamed. I also have a family history of alcoholism on my dad's side and I feel like it would upset him to know I've also been affected by this.

I seriously feel like even though I'm ""functioning"" and doing most daily tasks I'm living a half-life, unable to pursue my interests or feel fully in control of my brain. I'm about to go back to uni this year and at this point I can't imagine successfuly studying while I'm struggling with alcohol so much. I also feel like I'm embarassing myself around other people a huge amount, and ruining my close bonds becauses of how often I forget how I conducted myself in a social situation.

Mostly just seeking general support and wanted to talk to other people about how I'm feeling, because I've been too ashamed to speak with people in real life.

alcoholism,idontknowwhatmyuser-,2020/01/28,"My dad is a low key alcoholic This will probably be lengthy so I just want to go ahead and say thank you to anyone who reads this.
My family needs help/advice on what to do.

For the last 4 or 5 years now my dad has been abusing alcohol pretty bad, day drinking all day etc. 
I fortunately didn’t see all the bad/dark times he’s gotten into, (only heard of it from my sister, who hears it from my mom). I’ve only gotten to witness it a few times and that’s plenty enough for me. 
One time we were all on vacation and it was so bad that he was literally reminding me and everyone that he was acting like “frank, from shameless tv show) doesn’t help that his name is frank also lol 
But literally laying out in the concrete, stayed up all night drinking, woke up drunk still.. and then tries to drive to the store (drunk) to get more beer. He’s already an extremely stubborn person, but when he drinks it’s on another fucking level. I had to end up driving because he wouldn’t stop saying he was gonna drive himself if no one else will. The whole situation was pretty ugly.
A recent one that happened last September was worse though.  We’re all hanging out by the pool, cookin out &amp; drinking and he starts to have too much.. and ends up getting really emotional crying about his childhood, etc. (when he drinks he tends do end up talking about his childhood) but anyways, it escalates  he starts to make my wife cry, (not by yelling or being mean or anything) but just by bringing up some shit that she went through as a child. They hug it out and everything, and he’s saying sorry blah blah.... fast forward that night a few hours and we’re all at home now ( we all live really close to each other.) and apparently he’s still drinking heavily.. he ripped off all the paintings in their house, and ended up taking his truck, leaving the house drunk, blocking everyone’s numbers, stopped sharing his location etc. so my mom is crying hysterically, and doesn’t know what do.. my sister and I are saying that we should call the police (bc drunk driving is stupid af) and she’s begging us not too.. telling us that’s it’s okay, that he’s going to key west most likely. (He has a obsession with the beach/ocean, it’s his happy place)
Everyone calling him multiple times, go straight to voicemail..etc. we don’t want my mom to be alone, so she comes over to our house.. by like 1am he finally responds to my mom, saying he’s sorry and that he’s coming back home. That whole evening was extremely discomforting. The next day he tells everyone he’s sorry and that “he’s never drinking again” which he’s states everyone he drinks too much. Since then he stopped for a few months (to my knowledge)  but then started to pick it back up a little bit. He was drinking at the Christmas get together.. which was obvious (you could just smell it on him). 
My mom doesn’t tell me when he’s drinking (because she knows I’m going to end up saying something) so she tells my sister, but my sister tells me everything. 

I’m kinda going everywhere on this post so I’m sorry it’s a little hard to read. 

 He’s 50, so he’s for sure goingthrough some sort of midlife crisis.. 
he’s also for sure depressed and still has trauma from his childhood (he had a pretty rough up bringing)
He’s a pretty extreme person, everything he tackles in life, he goes 200% .. example: he’s pretty overweight (he’s been overweight my entire life and I’m 24) when he eats healthy, it’s fucking healthy.. nothing bad goes into his body.. but then when that stops, and starts eating unhealthy, he’ll eat 7 donuts in a row + ice cream etc. he’s a hardcore “cold turkey” type of person.. but that obviously doesn’t work for him. 


There’s sooooooo much I could say
But my dad is an amazing man (besides all of this shit) he turns into a different person when he drinks.

What is the best plan of action to get him to realize he’s gotta stop drinking all the time?  It’s like we’re all walking around egg shells and I’m not doing it any longer it’s stupid. 
(I can provide more  information if anyone needs it)

We just really want to him help. I want him to be healthy. I want him to live way longer, I want him to be able to witness my wife and I have kids etc. 
I’m rambling man &amp; it feel food to type this all out.

What do we do?",2.656600312256053,4.562494694379389,3.718247306791572,88.68549586260734,76.29508196721312,6.615556596409056,24.618516783762693,7.504730514565872,1.115255818891491,3335,113,686,44,75,1076,347,854,0.127,0.773,0.1,-0.9696,2,1,16,0,1,0,132.0,9,2,2,4,37,28,7,2,30,2,50,34,3,2,17,114,103,57,0,14,21,14,3,6,0,7,6,10,2,8,47,42,26,7,7,22,1,19,12,15,0,3,20,17,66,13,85,69,34,119,0,2,2,3,124,41,4,10,61,393,113,5,0.03968887480384157,0.04702482666971677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03878350911653882,0.0,0.08483067401546711,0.0,0.04110570475840908,0.043797660272431344,0.06347835768287316,0.0,0.08600575853625117,0.0,0.026989795856121056,0.04161724576857097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055502768150299066,0.0,0.03266056225226572,0.03533151310551588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06103658975223573,0.13255421062319858,0.04838793940320865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041651025497643004,0.0,0.0433299719573432,0.04408539269071165,0.0,0.0,0.08105355731389477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06837690270073013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06337667403546389,0.0,0.13078909597810204,0.07678812260935984,0.0,0.034183969711870786,0.0,0.0,0.04146642682361849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46655985114384,0.0,0.12183488178836074,0.033154962133429236,0.0446446421778171,0.1757628139702339,0.04100921717735307,0.2655815201191883,0.026214127493244282,0.0,0.0,0.1896221035221736,0.10700940456081627,0.0,0.03741513894566007,0.0,0.02006788761807949,0.0,0.0,0.043477222370734335,0.0,0.0,0.04799194495338323,0.0,0.0,0.07338345043628647,0.08294319594843695,0.0,0.11278051090750968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035096740914515194,0.042249545240317515,0.035553436134759565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044732246403489134,0.0,0.07980784852631963,0.0,0.07962235492260884,0.0,0.03908554696676912,0.13738689837989826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04362393527689113,0.06470346033737293,0.0,0.04202478779614339,0.0,0.0,0.056066852026851285,0.07755991786661866,0.07955735838995036,0.0700920071713723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02649263212072788,0.0,0.0,0.043232819853727365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2324156524446617,0.03167928121447379,0.0,0.08752766892386338,0.05885759554228386,0.03061050699024326,0.0,0.04220956861435325,0.07449064081058412,0.0,0.03808254578915878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068262616970892,0.0603703554750315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13861917842979465,0.04146642682361849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0380109710437656,0.2018892704177908,0.04279131979162901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07939923035404367,0.0,0.07627712847318788,0.0,0.03918797576726085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22093530367163786,0.0,0.0,0.031626894682718516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08148011928337416,0.032831047371253336,0.04461195817818557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030554434846983256,0.0,0.17771378386744602,0.1123679594547064,0.042303059768069376,0.09508676005967248,0.1659083824309194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07481258960816145,0.0,0.029841094511075836,0.0319004141794704,0.1734491296826332,0.03654018355087938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0389941179833504,0.0,0.11571451033798252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026946140745643655,0.043170098839279525,0.0,0.0,0.09548165925351576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404571599755644,0.03150318145423022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03679198456898272,0.0,0.0886224226941157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028893973549414188,0.0,0.04044635414054883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025558334122799474
alcoholism,Rapidforms,2020/01/28,"Throat and stomach problems? I’ve always been a heavy drinker but lately I’ve  been drinking like 2 pints of whiskey a day. I guess I’m a “high functioning alcoholic”, or a complete loser. Lately the back of my throat feels like it’s rotted out and a lot of days I’m just unbelievably nauseas. I’m trying really hard to slow down and I was doing great but the last couple months only gave me more excuses to drink... my question is has anyone else had throat issues?

alcoholism,Chrisp234,2020/01/29,"Heavy fraternity drinker recently stopping consistently drinking nightly Howdy folks,

Basically your typical frat guy (minus the douchey attribute, our frat doesn’t mess with Chads and Brads) and I have a pretty solid history of drinking almost nightly 8-12 beers since last April

Well long story short, I was immature and realized that might have taken a toll on my body as I developed pretty consistent heart palpitations and dizziness the morning after. About 3 days ago, I decided to take a break from constantly drinking with other guys in the fraternity and I’ve seen drastic improvements (no more dizziness, more focused, all without any noticeable withdrawals).

However, the main thing I realize now is I kind of began to rely on alcohol to fall asleep. Now I am not able to fall asleep for 2-3 hours after trying and can’t even manage to sleep for more than 3-4 hours after I do manage to. I am a very high-strung / energetic person and normally don’t need much sleep, but at this point after 3 days it’s starting to build up.

Any suggestions on how I can get back to a normal sleeping schedule / fall asleep normally? I intend on taking a pretty decent break from drinking at least until I can sleep normally sober.

alcoholism,idfkiefb123,2020/01/29,"I need some guidance I would really appreciate some advice so I can feel happier again. I have followed this sub a long time and it amazes me all of the sobriety stories I see. 

I’m 19 years old and live home with my dad. My dad is an alcoholic, and always gets drunk at around dinner time. It has been like this ever since I was a kid. I don’t understand why it’s always around dinner time. 99% of the time he is sober all the way up until dinner (at least when I’m home). I really don’t like how he becomes when he’s drunk. He’s not physically violent if conflict arises, but he can yell if it comes to it... his eyes start to get watery, he can’t pronounce words and thinks everything is funny. He basically thinks he is on top of the world and everything is just fine.

Most of the time I pretend like nothing is going on and talk to him like I normally would. Sometimes, however, I can’t... I just sit in silence and wait for him to ask what’s wrong. He knows why I become mute but he likes pressing me which really annoys me. 

When he’s not drunk we can do all sorts of activities together and we even go to the gym and play golf together. I like that good version of my dad which really conflicts me. 

Nobody in the family besides me and my sister know, and he is very good at pretending like he’s got it all under control. He also talks a lot of sh** behind my back when he’s drunk.

I really don’t know what to do and would greatly appreciate any advice. Thank you for listening",1.8276190476190488,3.7046336339869295,3.904169000933706,86.53661764705883,78.67320261437908,7.508683473389356,22.039682539682538,8.418075326091056,1.2821917833800178,1156,34,246,24,28,395,155,306,0.076,0.7490000000000001,0.174,0.9834,2,0,1,0,0,0,35.0,2,1,0,2,15,17,2,0,11,0,24,9,1,2,5,54,47,24,0,7,8,4,2,7,0,3,1,2,2,1,13,18,8,4,7,9,0,4,7,3,0,0,3,6,31,14,29,41,10,36,0,0,2,0,30,13,0,7,24,148,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19975753361568366,0.0,0.10923177532341646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173757646969568,0.17009439092215198,0.0,0.0,0.06950653996791678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1819777549179622,0.09555287577805137,0.0,0.0,0.07859344671843753,0.0,0.0,0.2257665929702447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804516243446864,0.0,0.0,0.11463759374188455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750896931738086,0.09245510927162312,0.0,0.0,0.1837201361754035,0.0,0.09635481736857553,0.0,0.05168062182587293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10680137402649734,0.0,0.1161769897154236,0.17145837714851705,0.08174695049004425,0.11268726688710942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20505062077054725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685163987740972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34954368420290405,0.0,0.09025360776827816,0.09045293950718758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08689558077485136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578767617924446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10014443740248867,0.0980735832566096,0.0,0.10725256410392488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273928232681292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08144841224602738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845494541145652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010886453360875,0.0,0.07234500870799003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1643056083105272,0.0,0.09410155385959364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13098452480880393,0.0,0.0,0.2979983724423331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10640457443832063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433423947496015,0.0,0.08112981485809892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18445787825074456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2178218909243297,0.11175096769339182,0.0,0.06582011148546142

I weigh only 140 pounds at 6 feet tall and have no tolerance to alcohol. Ever since that drinking episode, my vision is blurry. Especially when reading. Will this improve on its own? Do I need to seek medical care? Will it get worse?

alcoholism,farnhakw,2020/01/29,"How to deal with shame? These days I don't drink nearly as much as I used to, but back in the day in high school and college I was a blackout drinker. I had borderline personality disorder (and I still do, but I've learned how to manage it and behave like an adult) on top of a booze and Xanax problem and I did and said a lot of shitty things that I'm very embarrassed about today. I ruined a number of friendships and am a pariah in certain social circles. 

 I'd like to quit drinking completely, but every time I do I can't stop thinking about my past, which brings me a lot of shame, which in turn leads me to want a drink. Can anyone give me tips on how to deal with this?",4.007375886524823,4.287110588652482,4.914326241134752,87.73333333333332,70.77304964539006,7.685106382978723,26.30496453900709,7.3871296695380915,1.097019858156028,527,15,117,5,9,172,88,141,0.174,0.6940000000000001,0.132,-0.8864,0,0,4,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,3,7,8,0,3,9,0,9,5,0,5,1,25,17,15,0,2,3,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,7,9,4,1,2,3,0,2,2,5,0,0,4,1,13,3,23,13,3,19,0,1,0,0,7,9,0,2,10,79,20,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130555896201108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12432763036527288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16952616284963412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20854999409312072,0.3333852198164276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18530776853741987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4751762913995645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13622860816595034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1551052873612671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17083161553680745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15798459315674135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2749216912614928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11885884311769415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543489187755908,0.0,0.14117920125711186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15471300560498216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17197445257922797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15380174360638868,0.0,0.0,0.1636362810531669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16481994270170944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12912376663810715,0.13517790642696334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10741792417222533,0.10360275737964,0.0,0.0,0.09428122329637377,0.0,0.1532607497523192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17586946168222456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13964600029390198,0.0,0.13340903841693355,0.09536741779799017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am off and on with my drinking , but the last 7 days I have had 10-15 drinks daily ( drinking them throughout the day and night ( so it’s usually a full 24 hours before the 10-15 drinks are gone). I am afraid to stop drinking now bc I am fearful of withdrawal. 

I had a big time drinking binge in October of this year where I drank about 20 drinks a day for well over 3 weeks, and I put myself in a 5 day medical detox bc I was afraid . I guess my
Question is if drinking 6 heavy days is gong to put me into needing a medical detox. Freaking out bc my 2 kids, husband and I leave for Disney in 3 days , and that has kicked of my anxiety .

The girl always been joking about me buying my beer every night but the cop looking for someone heard the girl say ""hey it was this guy"" he looked at me and said"" no offense it dont look like you been ruining"" she the added ""maybe a few years"". Yeah I got to stop but really i got no interest, I dumb, ugly, and can't feel no enjoyment unless I drink but even then (i been drinking for six years i can handle it with no problems in the morning not even a hangover in my life) no one wants to be around me or even entertained. I'm told it's my problem i can have fun, but comeon when you have fun it feels ""fun? i dont know what im doing wrong? What should i do?

alcoholism,POWDEREDTOASTMAN119,2020/01/29,"In need of support My wife just finally got the go ahead to go to rehab tomorrow. She has been struggling with alcoholism, depression and anxiety for the last 10 years. She also has had a track record of suicide attempts in the past. 

She is scheduled to fly out to rehab tomorrow. Tonight was the worst night I have had in a loooong time. It started getting very emotional seeing as how she's going to rehab tomorrow. 

The night started out typical, she drank one last time before rehab and started to get inebriated.  Out of nowhere. She said she was going to kill herself. I barricaded myself in front of the kitchen to stop her. When she realized she couldn't cut herself. She tried to choke herself out. I ripped her hands off her throat and called 911 for help. 

She was admitted to the hospital. She is extremely mad at me and says she will never forgive me. 

Was I in the wrong for calling 911? I just didn't want to see her kill herself.

alcoholism,ThisorThat490,2020/01/29,"Can I stay on Librium for an extended time for my anxiety? In general I am not a heavy drinker but over the last few weeks have drank a lot to deal with anxiety. I have severe anxiety, panic attacks, difficulty eating and sleeping and so I went to the ER and the doctor there prescribed be Librium. Ever since being on Librium I have had no panic attacks, my anxiety level went from a 10 to a 3, I am eating and sleeping well and I have tried many other medications for anxiety and depression (nothing quite this strong) and it is really helping me. 

I see my psychiatrist tomorrow and want to talk to her about staying on this medicine not because I am a heavy drinker for years or having withdrawals but because for the first time something has helped me anxiety. Has anyone had any experience of staying on this med just to help their anxiety vs. just to help with withdrawals?

alcoholism,crazydoglady-,2020/01/29,"how to know when it’s a problem So it was recently suggested by my therapist that I attend an AA meeting. It felt really weird since I had never considered my drinking a problem before, but when she laid it all out for me and point blank said “drinking everyday as a way to escape your problems or be ‘more fun’ is leading towards an addiction”. I knew drinking often wasn’t, like, a good thing but this is the first time I’ve been forced to think about this as a potential issue. 

I do drink often and most of the time I’m just looking forward to the next time I can drink. I’m 22 and I’m getting blood work done because my doctors are concerned about my liver function, which is a huge wake up call for me.  

I’ve also just started a medication for bipolar disorder that is absolutely not compatible with alcohol and the thought of having to get by without drinking anything anymore is honestly very worrying and scary for me. 

Has AA worked for anyone else and what other coping mechanisms work to curb the need to drink?

Dr google scares the hell out of me and I’ve been obsessing for the past week about getting cirrhosis. Does anyone have anything to say ? Like a similar situation. I am having very bad panic attacks... yes I have family and a regular doctor, but he doesn’t know about my drinking.",3.4691891891891875,5.6887388468468485,4.472333333333335,82.7685,74.94594594594595,8.043603603603604,26.41531531531532,8.841846274778883,2.1770461261261262,456,17,86,10,10,148,76,111,0.231,0.7140000000000001,0.055,-0.9752,0,0,2,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,2,9,2,4,6,1,8,8,0,0,0,12,14,6,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,0,0,3,7,4,0,1,2,0,1,2,8,0,3,3,1,8,1,17,11,2,14,1,1,0,0,2,4,1,1,10,53,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561957785312285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1188820889462556,0.0,0.1399121519919237,0.0,0.0,0.1934225418390409,0.0,0.0,0.14195977950896926,0.10364274625872476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14645736239182267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2192979491843648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740228965504028,0.14878583770893936,0.0,0.0,0.3331101707229888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16027992924711468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0888285460963595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09343866489198026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306329001028354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15955245624014386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19948209183607826,0.0,0.0,0.16230353538728626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18331055027094886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18083742906215947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13520690073040012,0.1702198975594206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1911098475608956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1767161051200399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16115928584555356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4208534551350062,0.0,0.0,0.13637996267669894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3284623363948446
alcoholism,Valdack-97,2020/01/30,"My mother’s an alcoholic and I fear I’m becoming one too. I’m 22 years of age and ever since I was a boy my mother’s been an alcoholic. I’m the youngest of four boys and my mother’s always had problems. Her father died when I was about 3 so I can’t remember how she was after it, my father always said that’s why she became an alcoholic but she always sort of was before it too.

My grandmother treated my mother like shit and made her do all the cooking and cleaning and everything to maintain the house when she was younger, she even charged my mother for babysitting any of us. She was and still is a true nasty piece of work who favours my uncle over my mother. I sometimes think this is why she’s an alcoholic. I’m the only one left in the house with her and most nights I get met with hate and rage in her eyes because I look like my father, my dad cheated on her about 6 years ago and they divorced but it made her worse and me being the only one left in the house and looking like my father, it was directed all to me. She’d kick me out of the house, punch, kick and slap me. Once telling me she didn’t know she was pregnant with me at the start and had went through some sort of operation and I survived, when I was a boy she’d call me her miracle. She used it against me and told me she lied and seeing he way I turned out she wished I had of died whenever she got drunk of course. You get used to the abuse that I don’t care about.

What I’m worried about is my behaviour towards drugs and alcohol, I smoke weed everyday. I have since I was 13. It has become an addiction at this point, I messed around with co-codamols(which is a painkiller that contains codeine) I took 18 one day not all at once but spread out during the day, I started vomiting blood and was in hospital. I stopped taking them and now I drink when I can’t afford weed. I just feel I’m going in the same spiral as my mother and the thought scares the shit out of me. When I’m not drunk or high I get fidgety and feel like a crackhead. I’ve been to the doctors who have sent me through different addiction groups I had to contact them myslef and where I am is out in the country so things like funding addiction courses out there isn’t possible. I rang so many places all sending me to different one until I said fuck it no one seems to care. Any advice would be appreciated.

alcoholism,onerockthreefingers,2020/01/30,"I had seizures I've been slamming the booze hard for nearly a decade. Few months back got the shakes...take the edge off no big deal. Walking around the house blacked out and had a seizure and fell down the stairs. That hurt. Woke up in rehab, 5 days later I was sober for 3 weeks then some personal stuff happens....oops, here I go drinking again. Another trip to the ER. Few months later I'm feeling way better, then of course more stuff happens, few days of the sweats, the shakes, hallucinations, and of course another seizure. 

Well after that (this is day 5) I'm sitting here like, things are looking up finally. I'm close to a new job, I'm growing a nice garden, I'm fixing up my old car (which I love) and I'm like, ok, this is the one. 

Here's the problem I could use some advice on. All my friends are saying ""hey how's it going?"" I know what they mean. Chit chat for a while. ""Ok bud sounds like you're doing well call me if you need me."" 

""But then....there is my family. ""You better not be drinking again! ""You know drinking will kill you! When was the last time you drank! Don't lie to me."" And of course I say ""I'd like you to be a little more helpful."" ""Well if you didn't do this we wouldn't be so worried.""

Now, this is only making things worse, I almost want to go on a bender just to prove a point (don't worry I wont) but any advice on how to get these people to understand that berating me isn't helping?

alcoholism,ignatzkat,2020/01/30,"alcoholism led to alcoholic ketoacidosis, is there a way to stimulate appetite? I have a friend who's an alcoholic. Over the years as his daily alcohol intake increased and his appetite has decreased to the point where he often doesn't eat. A few weeks ago he went to the ER for what turned out to be alcoholic ketoacidosis. He later admitted that he hadn't eaten anything for 2 weeks. 

So now he knows he has to eat but he'll still skip days! It's very frustrating. He has a medical marijuana permit but even that hasn't helped. Does anyone know of a way to stimulate appetite so he'll at least eat something consistently? It would be great if he quit drinking and regained his appetite that way but unfortunately I don't see that happening.",3.9688216039279887,6.408531163120571,5.042836879432628,78.22615384615386,74.24822695035459,8.877468630660122,29.28587015821059,9.466822959209583,3.021171958537916,598,26,108,16,13,196,86,141,0.053,0.84,0.107,0.677,0,0,7,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,1,8,3,1,0,9,0,12,11,0,4,0,16,22,9,0,2,4,0,0,0,1,3,6,0,0,0,8,3,10,0,3,1,0,3,4,1,1,0,3,1,5,2,14,14,3,19,0,0,1,0,17,5,0,2,8,64,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119714328460896,0.6702990280111351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771226204400916,0.0,0.10322842950887914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808999881944733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10977551371480126,0.0,0.0,0.12288582259514412,0.0,0.3850767604449292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08285354033932514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09691650837309466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13830071925502846,0.0,0.0,0.11092832442693462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08408141499240902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13787975518756004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12637004857176662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11858364063670827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13342346274244735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09996137369353672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657170931179077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001784847040988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13644533950461202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350314014534873,0.0,0.2987110804402488,0.2012446976644008,0.0,0.0,0.11628638711838248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911070143208646,0.0,0.0,0.08078081056846348

alcoholism,Foxsong,2020/01/30,"First time post. Wife of alcoholic husband. Need some guidance. I'll try to keep this as brief as I can.

I'm terrified of Tuesdays.
Tuesday is the day where I go to work and my husband has the day off. This usually means he drinks all day, and I come home to a drunk person talking at me. After three years of dealing with all his drunkenness, it's an instant fight. Screaming, glass breaking, holes in the walls, neighbors calling the landlord...

Except it me who it doing it. It's me that's angry and uncontrollable. 

I'm done being the sober hostage in my own home, but I have no family in this town to go to and he knows it. I ask him to have his sisters pick him up to leave and he refuses. 

We have done therapy and were released after six sessions because we had good communication skills and ""we could work this out ourselves"". 

He refuses to go to AA because ""those people have real problems"".

If you are wondering, ""He only drinks on Tuesdays, what's the big deal?"", it's been three years to **get him to drink one day a week** and my only request is dont drink/be drunk before I get home from work. No one wants to be greeted by a drunk person. 

Some things he's done to get us here in this bad place:
Punched a dresser, producing a boxer's fracture and was out of work for six weeks, leaving me with all the bills and I had to cancel my Cholecystectomy that I had been waiting nine months to get pushed through insurance. Waited another two months and had another attack before the surgery happened. - Courtesy of an 18 pack.

Babysat my daughter (summer visits) while we were dating, drunk, three separate times (age 7. and twice at 9) Other adults were around, thank god, but no excuse to be around my kid intoxicated. - Courtesy of four tall boys

Recently decided it's a good idea to go on drives while drunk. I tell him about the repercussions of taking a life. He still does it.

I hate being around him drunk. I hate myself for being here.

alcoholism,Fedora_Tipper69,2020/01/30,"Am I doomed? How can I possibly quit? Why are we afflicted with this disease? Why do we get so much more out of alcohol than the average person?

I broke down crying last night after I saw a video of myself passed out drunk. I was in complete oblivion - you could tell by the vacant look on my face. I didn’t cry due to embarrassment, but because it validated something I’ve known inside for a while: I’m so damn unhappy. I have no zest for life. Alcohol fills the void, and the only moments that I feel the slightest sense of well-being is when I am blind drunk, in which case I marvel at the simple fact of being alive. 

Why do I have to rely on this substance that is quite literally killing me, just to feel the same as everybody else? And further to that point, how am I possibly meant to quit?

alcoholism,gohmmhog,2020/01/30,"Realizing partner is High Functioning Alcoholic I'm a 37yo M who has a history of heavy drinking and at times bing drinking and I've felt dependency develop a few times but I've been able to thankfully cut back when I've really needed to without too much trouble. However as I've recently cut way back after about 3 years of pretty constant heavy drinking I've reflected on my current partners (34yo F) drinking habits and I'm realizing they truly are an alcoholic, albeit a high-functioning one. Single mom, excels at her work and her life is mostly on track. But I wanted to share some of the things I've personally noticed in their habits that stood out to me incase it helps someone else realize their person might truly have a problem.

1) When I bring up the subject of their drinking I invariable get the retort that I am ""judging"" them no matter how I frame my question. 

2) They have multi-day benders. Whereas I might drink heavy and be hungover for a good day - and then usually wait at least 36-48 hours before I even look at alcohol again - they will just keep their buzz going by drinking as early as they can...9am...10am. But sometimes still go to work...pick up her kids buzzed etc. 

3) They will regularly drink before going to work and sometimes it's not a small amount. Gum and mints are a constant necessity for this reason. I am often also asked to smell their breath to see if I can smell booze. 

4) They will be late in coming home from when they said they would be home and not text -- I'll be watching her kids and making dinner and I don't mind. But when I ask them to kindly let me know if they're heading out to the bar to just shoot me a quick text just so I know what's going on. But I often get a defensive response and some bit about how I'm too nosy and about how they feel anxious that they feel like they have to check in with me. 

5) They have a distinct ""drunk"" personality and a ""sober"" one and I am crazy in love with the sober one but often find myself incredibly annoyed at the drunk version of her. 

6) They dont make very much money but easily spend $100/wk on beer, wine and going out. And that's just solely for themselves. 

7) They purposely go to dives that serve strong drinks even if they're dangerous or out of the way. 

Anyhow -- I know this isn't a unique situation and I would leave her if everything else about the relationship wasnt good. They are a very loving person and is a good mother to her kids and I dont think shes ever really putting them at risk because she has enough sense to only get truly wasted when she knows theyre being cared for. But I start to resent her when I notice this intense split in drunk/sober personalities and the defensive guarding when I bring up her habits. I just am not sure how to help her cut back. 

Any suggestions welcome.",3.758336314847945,5.253322078711985,4.699677996422185,84.52264758497319,72.39892665474059,7.632915921288013,25.16457960644007,8.20894155585173,1.4559881932021468,2218,68,444,34,43,721,272,559,0.08,0.77,0.15,0.9928,2,0,14,1,1,1,62.0,0,0,23,4,36,25,8,1,25,0,37,24,2,8,3,96,77,51,0,9,22,2,3,1,2,7,4,1,2,10,13,28,19,5,15,14,3,10,10,11,0,3,5,10,64,14,62,59,13,65,0,0,3,2,61,24,0,16,30,284,77,3,0.06268927204216644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20098730036412693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05013258820311033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04263085469541051,0.0,0.0,0.07082103361579044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11721201385950122,0.0,0.0,0.14461254186779013,0.0,0.03821479837611826,0.0,0.10668790644964997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844044869093674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06391589086795507,0.0,0.0,0.054001256976828116,0.0,0.13548966461135964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08085878862623494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14694271989616647,0.5527045849157808,0.0,0.0,0.1047376853590767,0.0,0.0,0.06477477591827659,0.06991510948769449,0.08281134589449042,0.056706035590696625,0.0,0.0,0.05634107548390312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339515909277631,0.04478522847283253,0.06019153215113158,0.0,0.057296858934619325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825767171323906,0.0,0.21376654785842591,0.1577423613498078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643372789706848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840385952334465,0.13246931558483888,0.1257649024582128,0.0,0.06173630516931405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0557211053891376,0.0,0.06528122994682578,0.137809537793104,0.0,0.07071622941605547,0.06637888747634009,0.0,0.06410402799124261,0.0442792867854113,0.030626811762360182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05264319981880679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131590311412942,0.0,0.0836911517566426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13300682186644974,0.06329829405996085,0.07342091775073828,0.0,0.0,0.09216765614216313,0.04648330088638464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427443034434079,0.0,0.0,0.1274396194406532,0.04767801627485575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2736892715463771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06377752686700182,0.0,0.05998516697323372,0.0,0.06302003329549911,0.0702263318011217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032070584152913,0.0644550125428619,0.061898093251508725,0.0673048173681545,0.0,0.0,0.05963185341094952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049955233410194366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07046536835293021,0.0,0.0,0.05311641676695062,0.0,0.1240025860204762,0.0,0.04437178941135784,0.0,0.05006373363190805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05908389700268143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05771585912710363,0.0,0.0,0.04164796677689001,0.04016875424275902,0.0,0.0,0.07310923732311737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06904337648080293,0.10345042957294352,0.03697575687350207,0.09951965240328832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06043022117675876,0.0,0.13691561001697108,0.0,0.0,0.08906532043134274,0.0,0.0,0.04036983584663574
alcoholism,kennyz6,2020/01/30,"How can I (F21) effectively help my mom (F42) who’s become an alcoholic over the last couple years, without hurting our relationship 
A little back story: growing up, I hardly remember my mom ever drinking. She was always sober even when her friends weren’t, if she did drink, it was one or two beers and she always bragged how she never drank hard liquor. My parents divorced when I was 11, and it seems the couple years after that she began to drink more. Fast forward to now, she drinks all the time. Every day, and a lot. Pepsi and whiskey is her weakness, and ultimately it’s what gets her the most fucked up. 

I moved two hours away for college a little over a year ago so I kind of pushed these thoughts to the back of my mind, because I’m no longer constantly exposed to the toxic environment. I just ended up moving back to finish my last two years of school (I got placed here for the program I’m in, I did not choose to come here) 

My moms a great mom, her friends, her family, teachers, other parents, everyone tells her all the time how caring and loving she is for her kids, and every other kid she crosses paths with, and she is. When she’s sober. Getting drunk is really her major downfall. I almost feel as if she prioritizes drinking over some things that she shouldn’t. It’s definitely gotten worse over the years and it breaks my heart that it’s getting so bad. 

Alcoholism definitely runs in my family, her parents were alcoholics until their mid thirties, and now my grandma is constantly talking about how great it is to be sober. 

It’s just so hard to get through to my mom because she doesn’t see an issue. She doesn’t understand who she becomes when she’s drunk or how bad it is and the issues she can cause for everyone around her- she can get decently mean (not physical, just verbal) She sees no problem with it at all, and I don’t know how to effectively convey the message that she’s ruining her life, as well as her children’s, and it’s pushing all of us away. 

I guess my biggest question is,  how can I appropriately address this situation and essentially tell her I’m distancing myself until she doesn’t drink every day. I’ve been tempted to when she’s drunk and I’m pissed at her but I know that won’t be effective and will only be more harsh and probably make her angry. 

TLDR; help me confront my mom and her alcohol problem",4.837897234273321,5.945419440347076,5.539934246203908,81.00311178145337,69.3470715835141,8.365536876355748,29.156792299349238,8.660442795831766,2.16669680043384,1866,68,358,30,32,606,218,461,0.08900000000000001,0.83,0.081,-0.6941,4,0,12,0,1,0,52.0,2,0,1,3,32,18,3,0,18,0,30,23,2,12,6,70,58,43,0,5,11,9,4,0,2,3,6,0,1,3,24,22,17,0,13,12,0,9,13,10,1,4,13,6,68,8,44,39,10,63,0,2,2,2,67,20,2,11,35,253,92,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05433369776696161,0.2620198593284264,0.0613773864938737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10200353388475593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05456492124582083,0.0,0.0,0.11517602316933814,0.14139459735270749,0.10235635878169633,0.07472887150059347,0.13538947516867889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06249362286969809,0.06296612935295008,0.0,0.05279961121048082,0.0,0.13247472401592278,0.0,0.0,0.13564195198923104,0.0,0.07905950419353405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3602704681525669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05428855579203838,0.0,0.0,0.04048430640162632,0.05544420259997312,0.15492927149783886,0.11713865878604532,0.0,0.0,0.1155656200669573,0.0,0.030992239256221982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09471164670292002,0.05666559173172584,0.16011870696306915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04902265024190605,0.1351543620454898,0.06752258071624262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16472295739934886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07263403942195805,0.08216855316728908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06036253770741101,0.0,0.06561681478607237,0.0,0.0,0.12795064677041595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0638285801757064,0.06737148747939517,0.09992606903352988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04329397606337757,0.0,0.1228659803532578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0521102210951787,0.05532049792636109,0.0,0.040914420532879504,0.0,0.0,0.06676746063799661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0618897689379105,0.43072285302015617,0.0,0.13029227909757302,0.0,0.0,0.04727394205363128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04153460330355783,0.04661707640767632,0.0,0.0,0.20418019600659665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06403949661649506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06608562128267445,0.11730073231227026,0.0,0.0,0.06866364272647425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039266697462282216,0.0,0.0,0.0658071383626468,0.06943449214452273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06203310292284449,0.09768724098844156,0.055800027746288915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06889736019356947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049266035740205064,0.10714783794313648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04072120866502055,0.0,0.0,0.04866082675726105,0.07148239731182095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17962687110544687,0.06380952690662044,0.07372949471522948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05511093594007579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05908551693278825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06246412718777905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19735759468042827

alcoholism,cheekychoo,2020/01/30,"I have cut out alcohol, my husband cannot. We are supposed to do this together. My husband and I are trying to cut out alcohol together. I'm succeeding and he is massively struggling. 

I can now go days and even went 2 weeks no booze! When I do drink, I limit myself to only 1 to 2 drinks and it must be in a social setting(no more drinking alone at home). My tolerance is really low at this point and I usually just have 1. I feel like my head is clearer, I have more energy and I'm less puffy/bloated. 

Unfortunately, my husband is having a much more difficult time with giving up the booze. Being sober and much more clear makes the problem of alcohol very contrasting and startling. My husband is often if not always, angry when he drinks and extremely impatient and agitated. We always argue when he drinks. For a long time now, I cannot stand it when he drinks. I have now associated drinking with being a fire starter rather than something fun. I'm tired of it. He said we would be in this together and it's like he's not even trying. It feels lonely, sad and honestly...makes me want to drink again...

I hope anyone who is reading this can undertand and sympathize how it's like to be alone in this struggle when your partner should make an effort as well. It makes me feel like I'm the only one in this relationship who cares at this point.",2.948606918238994,5.061185400000003,4.434740566037738,82.93412342767297,76.13207547169812,7.888364779874215,25.758647798742146,8.72156446121922,2.017430817610064,1061,39,206,23,24,353,132,265,0.158,0.703,0.139,-0.6664,0,4,12,0,0,0,34.0,3,1,0,3,16,20,3,3,8,0,27,15,1,4,2,41,44,21,0,8,5,4,4,4,1,3,4,1,1,1,16,20,13,1,3,9,0,2,5,11,1,1,2,5,24,9,23,34,7,32,0,3,0,0,22,13,0,3,20,139,40,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2831940380558058,0.0,0.18296668672059424,0.0,0.0,0.1469954363043317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06176245883610645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005842258708735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05696560633900478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6922389533874351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11668239435133272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13398705587975976,0.12620608041896952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08473427946466301,0.05020003069812719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09065216457070774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08860229106095475,0.08773171856193515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17261449813086566,0.0,0.0,0.07816935782411362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17688308046751908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298655719727098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059854760926535425,0.13435804084044253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16700098829478482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08451997528115368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835400214779618,0.0,0.05658652309261785,0.0,0.0,0.09483346946083053,0.0,0.0,0.08402215131803822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09004141202296599,0.0,0.06800082545025754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18468359550706656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10301198184763118,0.1015224546520733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11994067784785105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972831246112686,0.07288158216039851,0.05209938080767282,0.0,0.07085307724275698,0.0,0.07941936681139035,0.08188288649989486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274716785088,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,berrysoda_,2020/01/30,"Trying to figure out ""where I'm at"" Based on reading, and assumptions that feel pretty obvious, 1.75l of 40% a week is probably pretty bad. 25yrs old, 180lbs. My experience with alcohol has only been going on for less than half a year.  I'd generally lean towards my habits being healthy, outside of my alcohol consumption. 

Reading around about other experiences with alcohol kind of confuses tho. I never get hangovers. I, perhaps, assume this is because I stay pretty hydrated (120oz+ of water per day and only drink loose leaf tea)? I don't do mixed drinks or even like them. I drink straight and chase with water (while also drinking water), which feels way better than chasing with soda or anything else, anyway.

Still, though. My heart doesn't feel ""great"" and I am going to scale down. I'm mainly curious of how much I may have fucked myself.",4.984635364635364,7.282738402597406,5.504025974025973,76.70076423576424,70.81818181818181,8.115084915084916,28.07992007992008,8.841846274778883,2.5301574425574422,670,25,109,13,13,215,112,154,0.078,0.7879999999999999,0.134,0.7968,0,0,7,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,1,1,10,7,1,1,2,0,11,14,1,1,2,23,20,11,0,0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,4,10,12,0,5,6,0,2,3,3,0,1,1,3,13,4,22,17,3,20,0,0,0,1,1,9,1,5,8,72,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3900807921477398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09729848444780696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10012304427391017,0.1083110150892274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10158835445338238,0.07416816284071552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10760615417487528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784663017570886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4767563631401052,0.0,0.0,0.10163865875747027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08036108586666926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380308388256005,0.0,0.0,0.18455818227649531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11248083239128716,0.06356691914871168,0.0,0.13829435022715764,0.0,0.0,0.13414026642625398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14417809757996822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12669931803602474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059441223259265735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944055732178116,0.0,0.09383846863868214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12767092433089372,0.0,0.0,0.18506918917597506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3713426891614328,0.13117953000760432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24340342320655614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12968273765055752,0.09716484990657516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11953896479532368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260511935001774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657501935050446,0.0975953614232276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0783507093104902

alcoholism,gtiger19,2020/01/31,"Fair critiques of AA? Hey y’all I have been around the treatment, recovery, AA scene for a couple of years now. I have grown against AA, and stopped going 6 months ago, for various reasons. Firstly, I’d like to state that I don’t believe I’m an alcoholic. There’s no need to get into the details of my story as this isn’t the point of the post, but I have remained sober thus far due to me receiving many financial benefits that will impact my financial future greatly. Second I want to share my critiques and problem with the program. I hope to see the other side and what people the live and breath AA have to say about them. My first critique is the simple holy than now attitude that it’s the only way. I was constantly told by other ls that if I left I would relapse and die. This was hilarious to me, as it made absolutely no sense. I don’t understand how that helps anyone to force your believe ls down people’s throats. Another problem I have is the people by at large seem to become codependent on the program and have a lack of internal believe in themselves. If you’re told every day you’re powerless and your thinking is fucked up you’ll probably believe it. Again I feel as if this goes against “our primary purpose is to stay sober and help others achieve sobriety.” There are countless others like lack of scientific data, contradictions throughout the big book, lack of care for advancement in the treatment industry. (Yes treatment industry is AA since 90% only use 12 step method). 

TL DR: been around the scene don’t see myself as an alcoholic. Doesn’t like AA due to its constant dehumanizing manner. Believe everything in it contradicts itself. Treatment industry doesn’t advance, only “disease” where it’s acceptable to not research further on effective treatment options.

alcoholism,volition134,2020/01/31,"Desperately Need Help with Perspective Hello fellow redditors,

As the title says I am in desperate need of perspective regarding my habitual alcohol intake.

I used drink about 3-4 glasses of wine a day which I knew was a problem. My wife pointed out that it was a problem I needed to work on. So I began my journey of fixing it.

Yes, the beginnings of that change did cause irritability and nights where I didn’t sleep but I got there. During that time my wife told me it was okay to drink of the weekend, so I looked at that as my goal.

Well I’ve hit that goal and have improved. I don’t drink on the weekdays and have resorted to drinking on the weekends.

My Saturdays and Sundays consist of spreading out a six pack through the mid afternoon to evening. Sometimes I even only drink a tall boy in the evening and that’s it.

But now I’m being told that I am an alcoholic again by my wife and I should only drink on special occasions. I’m constantly being called an alcoholic and I feel that I’m not being recognized for any of my progress.

I’m being told that I need to go to AA or I need to leave. I just feel this is unfair and I am not being supported at all. 

I’d really like a fresh perspective on this situation.

Thank you in advance!",3.0044209523809533,4.786399804000002,4.676057142857143,82.74126666666669,74.96,8.281904761904762,28.30476190476191,8.976282227363876,2.3816761904761896,981,41,196,22,21,331,133,250,0.068,0.807,0.125,0.9513,0,0,10,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,5,12,8,0,0,15,2,18,11,1,2,1,31,42,15,0,8,6,3,2,1,1,1,3,1,0,1,16,11,10,0,3,9,0,3,4,2,2,1,11,4,27,6,33,24,1,32,0,0,1,0,13,16,0,1,14,135,43,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3254043769202559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06902061316613417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10363854278343236,0.0,0.0,0.10426412787535892,0.10736908100057473,0.0,0.0,0.10968088484227212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545638377095914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5965633674354919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20111102316343735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263863541115224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05768239269035313,0.0,0.08117544981938156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06803048418892582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10746937981039464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04958571303027249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08523089570879598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.376289186797558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952469172292526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15438423373621646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959463216708374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942355148610827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06502079780863343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071352072016577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11408551307371148,0.10156908246363217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10038192504548786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11517621224860207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09344368098704277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059183007521231124,0.0,0.0,0.29095071169983033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876597693235671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912568984505566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07389013914065393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,caitiebird_,2020/01/31,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, it’s kind of long I’m sorry guys I don’t know where to ask this, I’m hoping here. It’s health related due to chronic drinking. All of last year I was drinking heavily, and in November I had switched to vodka or gin. After a particular stint I woke up with blood in the snot from my sinuses and a really dry throat. Not so much sore, but just extreme dryness that felt pinpointed to the spot where your throat and nose connects. Since that moment I’ve been actively working on cutting back more and more, and wishing to quit fully by 2021. I’m on day three of being sober right now and I spent half of January sober. The issue is that the feeling in my throat will always come back after being asleep... even after a week off. If I go and huck a loogie in the morning, (sounds gross I apologize) there’s that same blood in it, and it’s dark and clotted. I have gone to two doctors and they tell me it’s from the dry weather and nothing to be concerned about. I have told them about my drinking as well and that I thought it could be linked, and they don’t seem to be  concerned. It’s really frightening me, has this happened to anyone else? Am I worrying for no reason? Should I do my best to stay sober longer and see if it goes away? It’ll start to go away later in the morning then by afternoon I’ve forgotten about it. But every damn morning it’s there and in the same spot",3.188511556240368,4.356052481355936,4.199545454545453,88.83697611710329,73.33898305084746,7.397534668721107,25.612480739599384,7.84624498591911,1.2511694915254228,1122,36,242,15,22,364,161,295,0.08800000000000001,0.846,0.067,-0.7299,0,0,4,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,3,3,15,8,2,0,13,0,21,15,7,1,2,41,43,24,0,7,9,0,2,0,0,3,5,1,0,1,20,17,3,0,7,4,1,4,5,3,1,3,9,5,22,5,42,25,7,41,0,0,1,0,9,18,1,6,17,164,42,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10939579430073444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919287484320787,0.1347092881272753,0.0,0.0,0.12290919984825904,0.0,0.24704580437859774,0.2021887373001246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379724569607899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11325206465231538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10497022973865172,0.0,0.0,0.08478899631110164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345678497089322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3863794961376088,0.0,0.0,0.10982854638837283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08683645922549924,0.0,0.11077139565961074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06647653275274402,0.0,0.12623438179646373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14943789739902408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301786143613442,0.11626084874107045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13974930129879956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13058202728935414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372233108174127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13690855525257511,0.07225394165615143,0.1071677742618552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11634917660222956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09664754060024604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12615157363050666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13736095862905476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12591447638355413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13983736886449405,0.0,0.0,0.16844951914337392,0.13517580249663952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2245538853029206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10476669693671167,0.11968778188028167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10875555202510542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14717289132159458,0.09305703319665926,0.1401323742554662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391143647137105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11491290931781654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10437461510804676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256277712466314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12842969580862526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10545944634057024,0.0,0.11820972043248948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15118708323803845,0.0,0.0,0.09571367029602544,0.13351687920243974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846640896019953

How worried should I be?",1.922413793103452,4.5205167011494245,2.8581724137931066,90.06656896551728,83.13793103448276,6.238620689655173,24.791954022988506,7.554174236665415,1.4078009195402292,351,14,69,6,10,111,67,87,0.179,0.634,0.187,0.4234,1,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,2,2,5,0,0,5,0,6,9,3,1,1,10,10,5,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,2,4,3,0,0,2,0,0,3,4,0,2,3,2,5,1,9,5,1,19,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,1,13,38,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949666313224649,0.0,0.2132240109567191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13567904756470253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13950758946050373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16658915413737513,0.12162429028445118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12867257185467876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3394197321987668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15957273069451744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373267603261424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3252675166390443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14092542832681465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3744681601721813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20936052568880129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20298148285257386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17038723890463242,0.0,0.15866468167337705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2326810419132942,0.0,0.18911968730338832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3292464074413077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20262016276207503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12848301816019173
alcoholism,wydmanski,2020/02/01,"I went to an AA meeting for the first time I don't know if I can call myself an alcoholic. I've always been a responsible drinker, I never blacked out, went on a bender, or ruined a friendship or relationship over alcohol. I didn't ""call in sick"" just to drink, lie to my family about it, wasted my paycheck on it, or did some other stupid things. So maybe I'm not a textbook alcoholic.

&amp;#x200B;

But I did notice over the last 2 years that I started looking forward to drinking. And when I do drink, I feel relieved, like ""aaah, finally"". I did try to stop drinking. Or to limit it to 1 time a week. But I failed to keep that promise too.

&amp;#x200B;

This got me really worried. What if I'm not an alcoholic, but if I keep on going that path I'd become one? I tried to shake this thought off of me, until yesterday. I promised I wouldn't drink, but I did. And I felt this ""aaah, finally"" feeling again.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I decided to go to an AA meeting today. It felt weird, but in a good way. I've always admired people, who are able to just remain sober. I met some guys who've been sober since the 90's and it was an inspiring meeting.",1.7351541162699995,3.7136514678111614,3.5310124853687093,88.6105491611393,79.38626609442059,6.4681232930159975,25.18318376902068,7.520522993642371,1.2716798283261803,884,34,185,13,22,296,127,233,0.073,0.8009999999999999,0.126,0.9136,0,0,10,0,0,0,51.0,0,0,0,3,7,12,1,1,14,0,13,10,0,0,1,36,31,18,0,4,16,0,4,1,0,1,5,0,0,1,16,4,9,4,8,5,0,6,6,5,4,2,15,6,24,7,25,15,2,32,0,2,2,0,9,10,0,9,18,120,40,2,0.08845447246011791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3781237213481336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14720241405373471,0.2875211518639485,0.32244559759056823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976910153172454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.180643812369368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4332585402077309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08338700438894871,0.0,0.08945047807071309,0.0,0.1698603301506952,0.193795101919206,0.0,0.07523932908758807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10054143026640557,0.07419141480552621,0.07074512209619549,0.0,0.0,0.0875838345278663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15724479872012467,0.0,0.0,0.04861226477977952,0.0721022009161685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043214387236028315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07427947903834373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886440667536064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06822154220649868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10070600316814024,0.0,0.0,0.05993903975871617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061323193747093475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05666620006416685,0.0,0.0,0.09496700025995304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0731704536823066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06260853087994266,0.0,0.0,0.07395189970574834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058765221070176135,0.0,0.0,0.07022297067288058,0.10315702844703868,0.0,0.08384449718220058,0.0,0.0,0.12010956099270885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07021104302205068,0.0709528423159775,0.0,0.0,0.16399636431593484,0.07981640318217957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898298104655202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32244559759056823,0.05696178017051859

alcoholism,likalukahuey,2020/02/01,"A question about my AA experience Hello, I'm a 32m alcoholic. My drinking is more sporadic than daily, but I could never stop once I start. My question is about AA.

In trying to fight this drinking thing, everyone tells you to go to AA. So I went to AA, and I was put off by how hard it was to fully integrate. I attended weekly meetings, the same meeting, for two months and stayed sober the whole time. 

I wanted to start the program and become accountable to myself, but my sponsor kept putting me off. He said I wasn't integrated into the group enough, hadn't met enough members by staying after and picking up chairs, etc. 

Is it like this everywhere? I just wanna get sober, dude. Not engage in forced socialization rituals like a toddler. I can meet people and socialize just fine. But using it as a barrier before I could start on my sobriety put me the hell off. 

Anyways, that was four months ago, I've lost all progress I made in that 2 months.",3.754882882882885,5.542112200000003,4.783243243243245,82.73612612612614,72.94594594594594,7.744144144144144,28.009009009009013,8.447377352677275,2.070052252252252,747,29,142,13,15,244,118,185,0.099,0.8059999999999999,0.095,-0.1783,0,0,3,0,1,0,26.0,0,1,0,2,7,7,2,0,9,0,11,3,0,4,2,28,25,11,0,4,6,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,8,6,3,3,2,2,1,6,4,3,4,2,11,2,20,4,25,12,7,29,2,1,0,0,15,9,1,2,14,97,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109311926128873,0.13178697881953635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13619250038660788,0.1049325766511728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19691510165866385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24160487517965684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25483616148433297,0.1375296006741861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178334343354917,0.0,0.12062641539714035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06442736271132482,0.0,0.07008315317411959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046664403489227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12049164257812445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13461365182894755,0.0,0.0,0.11668429541168605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2952882417274288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09510866872619522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13132719413580282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08549157832977011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3718990105477576,0.2762836085130088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11730146812561232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514096498771647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618504579478857,0.2628762534947986,0.0,0.1030974455179765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10778335570260568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819254704982703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0719063753766439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08372326451318557,0.0,0.12046151879971845,0.0,0.0,0.1065051700211282,0.0,0.0,0.07273479387647344,0.0,0.09891641491460514,0.0,0.0,0.11431488780195648,0.0,0.13767757333150446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am the daughter of a mom who died of alcohol when I was very young. Because of that I have always been scared of but also interested in alcohol, its effect, consequences etc.

alcoholism,throwwawayyok,2020/02/01,"Concerned for my sister and need to rant Hey, made a throw away because she knows my main acct. 

Tonight has been especially hard, she’s called me several times progressively more drunk. She’s in a bad place mentally, struggling with depression and in an extremely toxic relationship and i understand that drinking is her way of coping. Its so hard to see and i’m not sure what to do at this point. She can’t go a night without drinking, even on a light night she’ll take 5 shots and not feel it. but she blacks out easily and often. Somewhat recently I went through a bad breakup and really needed her for support, and we’d talk for hours each night (sounding at least mostly sober) but she’d always forget the conversations. We talk often, but it’s pretty much guaranteed that if she’s calling after she’s off work she’s not going to remember the conversation. She’s my older sister and she’s always been my rock and the person i turn to when i need someone to be there, but i’m losing all trust in her and don’t feel like i’m able to have a genuine conversation. It feels like a huge loss and it’s entirely out of my control. I’m in college and live over 3hrs away so there’s really nothing i can do. It’s a friday and she’s arguing with her SO so i know for a fact tonight she’s drinking very heavily. she’s not able to speak on the phone or reply coherently over text at this point and i’m just being eaten up with worry. Not really sure why i’m posting this, i guess i have no one that i can talk to about it and i just need to get all my feelings out. Hopefully someone out there can relate. Just feeling super sad and so fucking worried.",2.155357142857145,4.270779773809527,3.8169047619047625,86.39892857142858,78.64285714285714,6.938095238095237,23.892857142857146,7.972316293177498,1.3534571428571427,1308,45,266,23,32,436,171,336,0.138,0.76,0.10300000000000001,-0.7328,1,0,3,0,0,0,26.0,2,0,0,6,16,17,2,1,14,0,18,6,0,2,5,68,49,29,0,6,15,2,7,2,0,1,0,2,0,1,14,26,5,1,9,5,0,4,9,9,0,1,5,12,38,8,42,39,9,40,0,4,2,1,37,23,1,8,13,177,52,2,0.1877772752165537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15624573550405862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17642293131586434,0.0,0.15678618134379665,0.05723364204317759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19174159275408267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10530409059058236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08086614599564049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2759253632353898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062012559655436575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23736458106329603,0.13414812293437964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679853256750128,0.04905293803971316,0.0,0.10671815283457298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10342891942411588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682115553783529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09325260183836527,0.09246139561832764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10319747965902312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09173849167426937,0.0,0.08290538712768877,0.0,0.0,0.10503736970025633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0888396990372373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09461766386590413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06901895160718456,0.2784689405117195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643243786138895,0.0,0.0900886799757008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0636213707004081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08197993690597352,0.09809364312278293,0.0,0.17751022005881428,0.0,0.08991936161217103,0.09551849802212413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18044239622348604,0.0,0.09270370282853574,0.10080125994954106,0.10635752391411077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07481708837090745,0.0,0.0,0.10606743615915744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15910307593069584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09815278943692396,0.0,0.0,0.10654371332717928,0.17697785963883098,0.0,0.07059257089630447,0.22639239141344966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05474721962180934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10212387691682034,0.0,0.09774138291086117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746795884040228,0.0,0.07452443037709193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870357076928817,0.08471989199807371,0.0,0.0,0.09050529623053263,0.0,0.06835204638710259,0.19069693790825826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Rodman1r2,2020/02/01,"What's the drunkest you've ever been? I wasn't a drinker in college, went years between drinks. But the last year in school, living off campus in a student housing place, I  had a few weeks where I was drinking some, for the first time in my life ( was probably 23 at the time). I started to drink screwdrivers.

One weekend, my roommates had some friends over a Friday night, and I was having screwdrivers. I of course ended up drinking too much, and partially blacked out during the night. I spent part of the night keeled over the kitchen sink puking. I eventually puked on the kitchen floor. At maybe 3-4am, my roommate (Filipino guy ex-marine and college student) came to check on me, and slipped in the puke on the kitchen floor. He insisted on asking me, making me explain why I made him step/slip in my puke, even though I was wasted out of my mind and barely knew what he was asking (I only really remembered this later). 

I then woke up in the living room at 10am, still drunk, and went to my room. I spent the next 36 hours in my bed, wondering if I was going to die. I threw up 5 times that Saturday after I woke up (my resting heart rate was 110-120bpm), and was stuck in bed in a fetal position, until around 10-11pm Sunday night, before I finally started to feel somewhat okay. 

The ironic part is, I then went years again between drinks, but then when I finally started to drink again, at 28 years old, I actually became an heavy drinker. I've been drinking consistently for 5 years, I'm 33 now, and I'm absolutely certain I've been as drunk or drunker than I was that one night in college. The difference is, I have a tolerance now, and I've never been as sick as I was that one night. 

Anyway, I've never felt as terrible from drinking as that one night in college. What's the drunkest you've ever been?",5.749619579675446,5.753094988826818,6.022817238627298,82.24563314711361,66.98882681564245,8.718488959829742,31.85208832136207,8.269060116576782,2.229412184091513,1418,53,283,17,21,454,177,358,0.062,0.883,0.055,0.1075,0,0,10,0,0,0,57.0,0,0,0,1,14,4,0,0,22,1,22,16,1,2,5,34,47,24,1,1,4,0,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,1,8,13,13,0,6,11,3,6,3,1,0,5,31,3,35,3,52,16,8,88,0,0,1,0,8,36,0,6,46,183,43,8,0.0,0.0,0.07058992006127454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06439475803503297,0.1352495928538755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061552973260248514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273360414620727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07507379286611159,0.07557617229439982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5668972933321325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06406860551580935,0.0,0.0,0.047777529141921626,0.13086488276180067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03657547197543366,0.0,0.06945431571928921,0.15848204441386782,0.0,0.061529329565305275,0.0,0.0,0.055886945617109135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04111045960170148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07162443743995646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08571901666663304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712368115137158,0.0834665270060383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058963844260097764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051093359054178715,0.0,0.0,0.1277487841664406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844647815370475,0.048285128067698836,0.0,0.07267166562036201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07303917250510263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05317559846069095,0.0,0.11158062690831476,0.0,0.07693061289413215,0.4751798689717417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07590491395195684,0.0,0.19606814552259896,0.055015113868653834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15666660697488247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07557617229439982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07799090505273264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04634056870579965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194307292754305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0732083280187052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536002903066985,0.0,0.0577679656504901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710701742330804,0.0,0.12653986041475382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058023920088026225,0.0,0.0,0.20116978320793452,0.0652723759723658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844577159903597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329114432066676

I have no friends, people say I'm too toxic, cause I suffer from depression and that makes me pessimistic and not fun to be around. I drink alone. The only people who care about me are my mom and sister. They've recently found out about my addiction and they cried. It was painful. I don't want to make them suffer no more. I want to quit, I tried twice I managed to stay sobber for a couple of weeks and then I succumbed again.

alcoholism,ts_b,2020/02/01,"Faces Sad, drawn-out faces.

Confused Stares.

Empty Eyes.

Different faces all expressing the same sense of despair.

Different faces expressing the same memories.

Of lost opportunities.

Of lost dreams. 

Of lost futures. 

Of lost minds. 

Hopelessness. Pain. Guilt. Utter contempt for the thing that drove their faces into its contorted form. 

All the same. Different stories. All the same. 

I am the same. I share the different stories, though not all parts of every story.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope. Laughter.

All the same. Different stories. All the same.

Signs of life, and love, and forgiveness. Of being broken to the point of clarity

Being broken to the point of awakening. 

Tired, but persistent faces. 

Of faces that seem to look towards a better tomorrow,

that bare the scars of yesterday,

yester-month,

yester-year,

yester-life. 

Faces of wisdom, and experience. Of understanding the darkest places of a human’s mind. 

Alone, but together. Different, but the same. 

Faces of deliverance. Stories of intervention.

And most of all; Hearts of Gold.

alcoholism,tryingtolivealifeany,2020/02/01,"Things were different for a whole second I left my spouse. I’ve been drinking since leaving. Funnily enough in extreme moderation
Until last weekend.

A family member came over. I messed up. Big time. Turns out my drunk alter ego is only for family. I’ve fucked over a relationship with them. I said some HORRIBLE shit to my mom. (Tbf for her it was shocking but I never lied. And that’s how she treated me growing up)

I blocked my family on social media and I know an apology would fix it, especially since my mom is an alcoholic and would be very understanding. I don’t want to fix it though. 

I stayed suicidal pretty much all week. Feeling like a failure. It’s starting to pass. My ex and I have paperwork this weekend to do, I don’t wanna. He hates me too but only because I left. 

Idk.

alcoholism,bjorkkk,2020/02/02,"Last week I promised the Dean at my nursing school that I'm getting clean and sober. Last night I drunk called her office phone 3 times. I wish I could fall off the face of the earth I could not be more mortified. Drugs have been more my go-to in the past, but I was close to getting kicked out of nursing school because of my use. So alas, I seem to have replaced excessive drug use with excessive alcohol use. I'm going to have to face her tomorrow and I'm dreading it and don't know what I'm gonna say. (Doesn't help that I have no idea what kind of voicemails I might have left.)

Anyone have any stories of dumb shit they did while fucked up??

alcoholism,dingbatdiva,2020/02/02,Horrible break out.  I quit drinking 3 weeks ago after drinking 4-6 times a week for several years. I have always had clear skin but over the last 2 days my face has become a greasy war zone. Is this some kind of weird side affect from giving up booze? This is the only change I’ve made to my routine so I have to think it’s related somehow. Is this normal in the early stages of sobriety? I quit drinking to try to feel better and improve my life and now I look awful.,1.240309278350516,3.395407515463919,2.9125876288659818,91.45754123711343,82.09278350515464,5.5294845360824745,20.009278350515466,6.742157984588678,0.2861183505154634,367,10,77,4,10,121,74,97,0.139,0.74,0.121,-0.4309,0,0,3,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,3,3,4,1,0,5,1,7,7,2,2,1,12,12,4,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,3,4,0,2,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,8,2,13,10,1,17,0,0,1,0,1,5,0,2,10,44,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16126171602923428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15137258820348592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20091711033216766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1608940674856561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19244796916465487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11732379571653342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5346390574972587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09198456743148406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17451490351807006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18944240487719666,0.0,0.1482896437264137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12849596402684302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527675624713085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17213775640149906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1782436516761408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383588831007002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3869900956958802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20551859906733405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11656743310240553,0.0,0.0,0.10607941783963354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12351220754310388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2918516099292418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11715096044473652

Seriously feel hopeless and helpless.  Will take any advice out there.😞",3.5953947368421066,5.536505421052631,4.4433552631578985,84.35661184210528,73.73684210526315,7.276315789473685,26.61184210526316,8.07648339933343,1.6968157894736842,385,14,74,6,8,124,71,95,0.275,0.629,0.096,-0.9649,0,0,1,0,0,3,22.0,0,0,0,2,4,10,2,1,4,1,8,0,0,1,2,19,18,6,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,8,0,2,5,1,0,1,1,8,1,0,0,3,9,2,10,16,2,13,0,3,0,0,2,6,0,1,4,45,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305681885549936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16045449423660268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20867912506470013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35791112781895995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13409615940689726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20972372821042773,0.26104437201284114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2412754673429333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15749885292162027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25127968080349417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2060229566482787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25096249924106256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16700704405860625,0.2514919377653221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17740548141846815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1511876126384621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601949643494618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3893678997121523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21214791950978545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,faeli112,2020/02/03,"Starting Over Some context: I’m a 23f, and since I was about 16, I’ve struggled with substance abuse. I’ve made huge cutbacks in the last year of being with my SO, and then things will be going super good. Until they aren’t. Last night, it got bad. Probably the biggest fight we’ve gotten in, and family got involved. I was blacked out through a big portion of it, but I do know I said some pretty awful things. 

I’m positive that if I don’t make some major changes starting now, I’m going to lose my partner for good. I’m honestly worried starting now might be too late. The problem is, is I feel this weird shame about admitting I need help and that I realistically probably need to be in a program like AA. I’ve dabbled in it before, but I always felt embarrassed by it and kind of out of place. The idea of not drinking again also makes me feel kind of, well, angry. 

I guess for right now, I’m just looking for some advice to handle this weird shame so I can get the help I need. Also, just some general advice for getting through the first few weeks of this. 

Thanks in advance.",2.925417940876656,4.601318738532116,4.0186544342507675,87.8220387359837,74.91743119266056,6.4958205912334375,26.331294597349643,7.1686216300943375,1.1981887869520902,847,31,173,9,18,275,123,218,0.172,0.6659999999999999,0.161,-0.166,1,0,1,0,2,0,28.0,0,0,1,4,14,19,1,4,9,1,14,1,0,3,0,36,44,14,0,5,6,0,3,1,1,2,0,1,0,1,11,9,1,0,6,1,0,3,3,10,2,1,8,6,16,9,30,30,8,32,0,1,2,0,8,13,0,8,17,109,27,1,0.0,0.1425420308568854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2351217662983157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19241610571216625,0.10010359285871906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044984595886797,0.0,0.0,0.10237089397048088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12726698658180366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11785332948598415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11341306853856935,0.0,0.12165988303071933,0.0,0.1155118918501282,0.0,0.0,0.10233157131781437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12570903960252708,0.0,0.13674447481747945,0.201812646322326,0.1924381728270508,0.0,0.13252977953539105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16127612600836702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358099665585413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25055877808617394,0.06611661082784849,0.19612964668079286,0.13570954505438168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05877506090267341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10102609763855927,0.13459078492612153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11383572208770755,0.1606093569150694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276248425126505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676144218098669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128983132202516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12569336476945292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12239367436988002,0.2594187818696737,0.11511586218849545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10274001323767597,0.11443782797774828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951773347993602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25545799333428704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12576915254734988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11076089674520596,0.0,0.0,0.15985090467644492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09650160270842788,0.0,0.10816885422109404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12217580576000328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07747262689069713
alcoholism,FayeWhite1992,2020/02/03,"Casting for Channel 4 Documentary Hello, 

My name is Faye and I'm a Development Researcher at a documentary production company called True Vision Yorkshire. 

I am currently researching for a sensitive film for Channel 4 about the realities of struggling with alcohol. 

We are looking to speak to people based in the UK who have recently realised that they or someone in their family may have an issue with alcohol. The film aims to shine a light on how the UK's relationship with this every day drug is so stigmatised and misunderstood.

alcoholism,NonemuYurei,2020/02/03,"Day One. Again. I am 34 and I've been struggling with alcohol for 15 years, I fell into drinking when my father passed away unexpectedly from heart failure. I have managed to get sober for 6 months at a time here and there, and even a whole year once, but my life is particularly unfortunate and it seems I return to the old familiar whenever things get to be too much. Last January I quit cold turkey after being a 15 beer a night drinker and I started taking care of myself again. I got on medication for my depression and started feeling a bit more positive, everything was on the up and up. 

But then in July of last year I did a backslide and fell off the wagon when a very disturbing event occured that turned my life upside down. It literally broke me mentally and I lost my mind for a while. I was really disappointed in myself but I don't have many healthy coping mechanisms, so I always turn to the only thing I know makes me stop thinking about things, excessive amounts of alcohol. I suffer from PTSD, bipolar and anxiety disorder, among other things. I was also diagnosed with lupus last year. 

I have been drinking almost every day since last July. I have an app I use (AlchoDroid) which tracks my consumption and BAC when I am drinking. I have to keep track of this because I have a tendency to just drink until I black out and then the stupid stuff happens and I make life harder for myself. Is that the sign of a professional alcoholic? Keeping track of your intake so you can still get hammered without getting yourself into trouble? It's sad really. 

A couple of weeks ago I received yet more bad news that made me want to drink even more. The most important person to me in the whole world might have lung cancer.

 But I am at a 200+ beer a month habit. My body hates me, my stomach is a mess and I hardly eat, I'm getting sicker and weaker, and I'm also bleeding internally in my lower GI tract. I Honestly if I didn't have someone in this world to live for, I'd probably just let it consume me.

But I can't. I can't keep doing this to myself. I've got someone here who needs me. And not this ghost of a person that barely makes it to 3pm before cracking a cold one. Not this depressed, sick person who can barely get out of bed some days. I owe it to those I love, and to myself, to start caring again.

And step one is getting sober. Starting now. All of the booze from last night is out of my system. My blood is alcohol free. I know that craving is gonna kick in around 2pm, but I can fight it. I know I can. I've done it before. 

Today is day one. Again.

alcoholism,ParkandHarbour,2020/02/03,"Shame in going to AA I fucked up once again this weekend and got black out drunk and was nasty to the ones I love. Yesterday I was all showered and ready to go to my first ever AA meeting. My wife kinda pleaded with me not to go. Has this ever happened to anyone else?

I believe there's a stigma around groups like that. Especially the kind of drinker I am. I'm not someone who has to have a drink when I first wake up or drink everyday. So I think my wife is kinda ashamed if i go to these meetings. But I hate what my relationship with alcohol has become and I need to take positive steps to becoming sober and I believe AA is an important step for me",2.093,3.9126493555555584,3.6567592592592617,88.8829166666667,77.66666666666667,6.87037037037037,25.324074074074076,7.793537801064563,1.31362962962963,513,19,110,8,12,170,87,135,0.139,0.759,0.102,-0.7512,1,0,4,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,2,7,7,2,2,5,0,9,7,1,0,3,21,22,10,0,2,5,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,6,9,4,0,1,4,0,6,2,4,3,3,3,1,17,3,19,19,1,20,0,0,1,2,8,5,1,4,10,76,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16965695470997674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1110026618512631,0.16265955768194065,0.0,0.14132239283362366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3506568718229686,0.0,0.3577169032463499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3110318464936856,0.0,0.0,0.13261641438936586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2871994388072372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27006769957538873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14676310039527535,0.0,0.0,0.3608882895866601,0.0,0.12696798743684806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1403833283869943,0.0,0.0,0.1567341295423763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16531514159006513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07755790947981413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1432793260065349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11771214289108105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16906504745204246,0.10757404922862768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17043957998298942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13450953613676994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11936128714570016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017214795209465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,scrubbyduck,2020/02/03,"My drinking is a getting out of control I feel like I can't stop I have schizophrenia and hear voices especially when trying to go to sleep if I'm reading or watching a movie, working or with people it's manageable, there is no way I can sleep, if I drink enough it makes me less reactive to any hallucinations and I can get to sleep but Im now drinking excessive amounts every evening to the point I'm sometimes missing work/college or turning up hungover and stinking of alcohol which is sooner or later going to get me in trouble particularly at work, I will get sacked sooner or later its been noticed and I have gotten away with it so far with a light scolding. I can't really imagine quitting, it's the highlight of my day when I get home and start drinking. At lunchtime I will feel drowsy and like crying, by the time I get home my body is ready for drink and I feel so much better. I have a lot of existential sadness and intense fear based around paranoid beliefs and loneliness, and when I drink I become more accepting of my circumstances. I'm also single and the dates I have had sober have all been the worst. I can't imagine quitting but it's getting worse, my health is obviously  depreciating and I'm skipping so many responsibilities, I can't even keep my room clean it's a mess. I have no idea what to do, January was by far the most I have ever drank in a month in my life, some days I will be so tired from work I will have maybe 3 strong beers and just fall asleep from days of 4 hours sleep in a row but that is becoming quite rare now. There is no solution, All I can do is try to limit my intake but all of us struggling know that is extremely difficult, I can drink quite a bit now without feeling too bad in the morning and I just push it so often. I don't know why I posted, there is only three possible things, quit = iimpossible, moderate = unlikely or continue the way I'm going.

alcoholism,Niceguy3312,2020/02/03,"Im badly in need of help. Hi reddit, im a 22 year old man and I call myself a binge alcoholic. If you would look at my life as it is sober, everyone would say that i'm living great. I have a well respected pay and job. I have a beautiful apartment in the middle of my city. I have great friends and i'm a quite attractive and charming guy.

However I can't feel worthy of anything I got and I've come to the conclusion that it is because of my alcohol problems. I work 9-5 every weekday. After every working week I will always go out and get black out drunk. I mean every weekend, always blacked out. The big problem with this is that when I am blacked out I turn into the worst version of myself. I am agressive, creepy with girls, over confident and cocky. The list with bad qualities can go on for days, just imagine the anoying guy you never want to drink with. Every sunday I will wake up with the biggest anxiety and imagine everyone laughing at everything I did and said last night. I will imagine everyone hating me. I have lost many good relationships with friends/girls im dating for being the guy I am when drunk. I've never realised that alcohol was the problem. It has been in the back of my head but I did not want to admit it. I love partying and going out, 1/10 times I can control my drinking and behaviour. Then I will have a really good time.

The reason to why I have realised this problem now is becouse the first 3 weeks of January I had no time to go out and I could just feel my life changing. I stopped my bad habits of smoking and watching porn. I got confident, I was doing my job really great and I can say that I found some kind of meaning to this life. Then I went out, got blacked out. I started my other bad habbits again because of the anxiety. 2 weeks later and I've done the same thing 3 weekends in a row. Im stuck in this bad circle and I can not see a way out. I want to feel good again and I know that I have to stop binge drinking. I know that my sober self is great and worthy.

I don't know if this is just a rant for attention or an actual cry for help. I want to know if anyone else is familiar with my feelings and what I can do to control my alcoholism.

alcoholism,and56i2,2020/02/03,"As a 21 year old, can I have a drinking problem? I don’t feel like people my age can have a problem. At least that’s what I’ve been told and pressured into thinking. I guess my concern is that I drink at least a liter of vodka a day. Considering my family history I could become an alcoholic. I drink all day long in my room or at other places. I won’t go into it, but I make horrible decisions in public. I don’t drink around others anymore because they cast their opinions on me. I’m a 21 year old female and I don’t really get drunk everyday. Unfortunately, I’m just buzzed all day. People don’t notice, especially coworkers and family members. I only get really drunk on weekends. That’s when I’m having over a liter and a half. Sometimes close to two a day. I’m afraid of how much I drink, but I won’t tell anyone because I think it would sound like I’m over exaggerating to people in my life. I want to tell someone, but I don’t want to be brushed off or told that my drinking is normal. I know that I’m very young, but I’m fearful about how far I’ll go. Maybe I’m kind of in denial, but maybe most 21 year olds are like me.

alcoholism,voqtak1,2020/02/03,"Inspiration post (my Dad's success story) Remove if not allowed, I read the rules but I may have misunderstood the purpose for this sub. Apologies if that's the case. 

TLDR: my dad beat his alcoholism and we reconnected and I'm proud of him. 

My father was 16 the first time his older sister took him out and bought him a drink. He told me he liked forgetting. He was born in 1962, the 11th child of a very poor family riddled with substance abuse and dysfunction. As a child he was abused in ways I won't disclose, and a lot of the older siblings had contempt for him. 
By the time he was married and moved states away he had a full fledged addiction to booze. He was a violent, mean and nasty drunk most of my life. 

But when he was sober he was gentle, witty and funny, and sharp as a tack despite no formal education. I didn't get to see the sober side often. I never knew him, really.

What I knew was that he lost his job, did some really scary things, and went to prison. I was just finishing highschool and starting college, and I was scared of him, so we lost touch for maybe 3-4 years.

He became homeless after he was released because family got sick of him, so he moved about 20 hours from here to start over.

One day I wanted to get back in touch, it had been years, I was now graduated college, married, and in my own house, I wanted him to know I loved him and felt it important to break the silence, so I asked my uncle who is a retired PI to find an address or a number to contact my dad. I got his cell and we talked for hours.

The best news of 2019 was hearing him say he had worked with AA and a church group and was three consecutive years sober. I was in shock, and I felt immense pride and happiness. He told me how hard it was, but that he did it for me, for my family, and for himself.

It's been surreal and so great to talk to him and hear that personality and charm my mom always told me about, I felt like I was meeting the real him for the first time. 

He tried his best to be a father, but he didn't have any father figure himself, or any emotional tools to work through what had been done to him as a young person. He lost everything. And he chose to start over and keep fighting his addiction. He was a functioning alcoholic with a solid job for 20 years. He was never late on bills. He was all around a good guy except for this. And it nearly destroyed him in the end, even though on the surface he managed it well for years.

I'm not here to lecture, I'm just here as an adult child who saw her father's success and wanted to share something with you. I truly believe that if he can admit and change his life around, then anyone else can too. There's no such thing as too late. 

I love you, dad. :)",3.6173305613305615,4.5059009423423415,4.5239639639639675,87.97455301455305,72.009009009009,7.566181566181568,24.86139986139986,7.793537801064563,1.0852855162855164,2113,59,459,26,39,685,259,555,0.12300000000000001,0.72,0.157,0.9598,3,0,4,0,4,0,67.0,3,2,0,14,25,26,4,1,31,0,41,12,0,2,3,80,79,50,0,6,14,10,7,2,0,2,7,3,1,7,20,38,5,1,11,3,3,5,9,9,2,4,50,12,62,17,66,26,8,58,1,3,2,2,92,18,0,10,33,297,82,13,0.0,0.1829435468482708,0.0,0.16832320165397574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16501096851371413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06423826789803551,0.0,0.0,0.10500004640759876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05398144971713357,0.07910259616822829,0.0,0.13745233700567236,0.0721734702641365,0.0,0.07253384221120597,0.059363590509455874,0.0,0.04706163683109812,0.0,0.0,0.08698024310189928,0.1620375209019876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08166950401226793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04978891825461635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790044737902536,0.0,0.0756285917018081,0.0,0.0,0.06449238410713519,0.08684188508706908,0.06837807785574357,0.0,0.0,0.05099120826994175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693842005131172,0.0,0.21833759024617208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2223781477419108,0.0,0.07056125064966558,0.13133600313463914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08066974154053577,0.0,0.0,0.06475339430604607,0.1234910211196862,0.08511550321849941,0.0,0.0764421407366932,0.0,0.08218298935238498,0.0691578488403556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17402458222807518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520568835442447,0.08908076952851891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15322219128495948,0.06862070551416856,0.0,0.0,0.04242821298995515,0.0,0.17417448989723391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906014436215586,0.07543401790419214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25282538452315234,0.06563439942619907,0.1393556803653991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07755980904671797,0.08409563590573102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904180766043374,0.0,0.16410706592129815,0.0,0.0,0.11908591942190393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05231408898179984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348196578227424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07393819769644758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07722291524864819,0.08787280417188062,0.09891518597397002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06139414757833836,0.0772926933098689,0.0,0.06152001717828012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059433889274186524,0.0,0.0,0.16393196831269544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12410412391119903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10257918767052936,0.0,0.0758505959011654,0.0,0.13505136185865455,0.0,0.0,0.22130952500575385,0.08577428850016389,0.05241510613642896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0636997544598519,0.13660726070635562,0.06127937262502465,0.0,0.0,0.06941389052324072,0.07156704903891874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11240798484588632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2485778591380338
alcoholism,SleeplessSeattleLady,2020/02/04,"All the worst memories of my life have happened under the influence of alcohol but I don’t know how to socialize without it. Every bad thing that has happened to myself and my relationships has occurred while I was drinking. When I drink I have no filter. I’m me but fun and uninhibited and outgoing, until I’m not. 

I shamelessly flirt with people I don’t even know or like. I make rude and tone-deaf comments. I become so obnoxious and end up retreating/going dark for days on end afterwards out of embarrassment. 

Right now I’m making the decision to let go of the person I am when I’m drinking and happy because the person I turn into after the fun wears off is unbearable. 

Does anyone have tips on socializing sober? I’m in my mid twenties, everyone in my life drinks so short of finding all new friends and never seeing my family my only option is to find myself and my place as a sober person.",4.070373376623377,5.8327817840909075,5.806038961038965,75.82727272727277,72.06818181818181,8.892207792207794,27.912337662337666,9.424239791934726,2.7075110389610386,718,27,128,17,14,246,111,176,0.096,0.745,0.159,0.9182,0,0,5,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,0,7,10,1,1,7,0,12,8,1,4,3,29,26,19,0,0,5,0,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,3,3,11,5,0,5,4,0,1,6,4,0,0,1,1,20,6,24,24,3,26,0,0,1,0,8,13,0,2,13,91,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13564750546599855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08875105772085483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10597963660393088,0.07737417332660114,0.14018208100754906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08185810460869962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107560935038337,0.0,0.0,0.4973647460485838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22484119142469186,0.0,0.0,0.0838347931027377,0.0,0.10694237328020872,0.12128521020266014,0.0,0.0,0.11965648802264965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23201991284337484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09806431197052597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14427229440138772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22448414610839493,0.1351172906601446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13951269555730578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979255114498706,0.1793060990034564,0.062010643584160974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16945094458402604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789475239861788,0.12258792087888402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965345167809288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08799594195618067,0.3324860844613717,0.13261281781603312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136273245602501,0.0,0.10839587819846422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10114523830293763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2587743657331795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08432536967431575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13806129177285947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12235412997540256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,camike4304,2020/02/04,"Struggling Hey guys,

I literally just joined reddit because my life is unraveling before my eyes and I cant stop drinking. I'm 21 and have used alchohol to help solve my issues for 7 years, and not surprisingly my problems aren't being solved.  I've been in and out of benders for a few days and I'm just looking for a community to talk this out. I cant afford therapy anymore, and the notion of quitting is absolutely terrifying. Any ideas towards helping me quit is greatly appreciated, it's just that i cant stand the night sweats and twitching from withdrawal. My family thinks I'm a completely normal college kid, but I'm far from it. It's only a matter of time before they see me for what I am. If anyone has any tips to help me out, please send them my way. Thanks, and I look forward to talking to you. :)

alcoholism,mak_gardner,2020/02/04,"Any ideas appreciated Hey all,

The past few weeks I have been trying to figure out a way to quit drinking. Drinking 15 to 20 beers a day has taken its toll on my life. I just want to quit but can't make it through the pressure in my head, the shakes and sweats. I can barely eat or sleep more than 6 hours and when I'm awake I'm drinking just to avoid the withdrawls. I also have been having on and off liver pain which worries me.

After trying the only rehab center here once I exhausted all the in patient treatment options. My local Dr. has been trying to help but there is only so much she can do. The only plan I have now is wait for the withdrawls to set in and go the the local E.R. with the hopes they can help me with the detox and check on everything else. I'd prefer not to do that but don't know what else to do.",2.721790450928381,3.784651488505748,3.871379310344828,91.14616710875332,74.34482758620689,6.043501326259947,21.430592396109642,5.8734145424116955,0.05267780725022142,645,14,143,3,13,210,106,174,0.094,0.828,0.078,-0.5994,0,1,4,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,1,3,8,6,0,3,14,0,19,15,4,1,2,27,28,12,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,5,8,5,2,4,4,1,2,3,5,0,0,4,0,13,1,23,24,5,22,0,0,0,0,5,11,0,3,7,97,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096780109627855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10286643750499247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09755440732279573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4445508779120862,0.0,0.1547834388994121,0.25272757589274697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13594861659794308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08596826325692555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15524311519824394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20278155261849226,0.0,0.0,0.15024181006320214,0.1489670761438445,0.0,0.0,0.17076151666972547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313213697139626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10684403396133436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097159315014076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119831526096692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1610939332340036,0.0,0.3451350705873224,0.16095826857970313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14440103302370494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217811799800427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15137578752793682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081001632382319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08922092720879403,0.12006834225591467,0.1213368978516552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15361851873316612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,AmazonGrace88,2020/02/04,"Thoughts just before 100 days So this might get a bit rambley, I'm jotting my thoughts down for the first time.

I've been having a rough time between 90 and 100 days, two milestones I've been really looking forward to. Cravings, dreams, anxiety. I thought those days were over since I had felt so good days 60-90. This is the longest I've ever been sober. (I know, I need to reset my badge - took very many attempts to get here.) But I realized I had just let my sobriety become more passive. It wasn't as hard to fight anymore, so I stopped giving it the attention it still needed. Situationally, life has had a couple bumps with work recently. I'm able to recognize that and see that I need to do some some emotional tidying instead of drowning it with booze.

So, while the cravings may come, and I know they do, even many years later, I'll still be able to chip away at myself and learn something new. There's always a way to grow from these challenges. 

I guess it gets easier, but it ain't ever easy. But hopefully, only because the best is yet to come. I love this community and am rooting for every single one of you.

alcoholism,ConzT,2020/02/04,"How can I help a friend to accept that he has a problem and help him to rehab? A friend of my family who I have also known for years has a problem with alcohol which led him to get kicked out by his girlfriend(also long term friend of my family) at the end of december. since he doesn't have a job he went to visit his son in another country where he got kicked out aswell after a few weeks. Now he is currently back in my city where he stays at his moms as far as I know.
In person, I have never seen him completely wasted but heard stories from different people. When he usually comes to visit my city he would always stay at a friend's house who I visited a lot and he always had a few drinks as soon as it got dark and always stayed up late and sleep until noon. But he is banned there aswell. Years ago it was beer and wine and about two years ago he switched to gin. He sometimes messages me and others random texts in the middle of the night(1am - 6am),with the worst one beeing he will kill himself. Next day when I read it and called him he said it was just a joke. 

Now why do I think, although I am not as close to him as others, that I have the right/that it's my ""duty"" to help him? 
I have been in a similar situation a few months ago, although my addiction wasn't alcohol but video games. I went to rehab where most people were alcoholics or addicted to pills and from my experience, we are all not that different and reach to our substance for similar reasons. So I do feel that I understand him to a certain point and help him by going to the same clinic.

Yesterday I sent him a long text message that he should consider rehab, I want to help him, share my experience in more detail with him than before, answer all his questions and how it affected me and was the best decision I have ever made. And I will not tell anyone about this. (Which is true because it's a not so easy topic) 

That was probably not the most clever move but I just said fuck it, I have to be honest to him and just tell him straight away. That's how it worked for me when friends and family sat me around a table and confronted me. 

I sent him that message at 9am, he read it a few hours later and I got a reply the next day at 2am. 
Of course he denied it. His answer was that he doesn't know who's spreading those rumors and that he was at a hospital in his son's country and he came back to my city to get a better diagnose. (This is true to some point since he had an issue with his pancreas years ago, and still does apparently. What a coincidence...) Also he asked if his brother spread those rumors, that he is an alcoholic and that his brother is just jealous of him. 

I must agree that his brother is a heavy drinker aswell but he has his life together! 

Now I don't know what to do further and how to answer on his last message and especially how to   help him accept it. 

Sorry for the long post but I hope that you can help me!

alcoholism,BeefyNuggets,2020/02/04,"Father is a moderate alcoholic Some backstory, My parents divorced about 10 years ago. I've been living abroad for the last 4 years so I haven't kept in super close touch with my family.  I moved back to the US and I've been staying with my father for the last 5 months. 

It's really disappointing to see how dependent on alcohol he's become.  I don't think his alcoholism is as severe as a lot of the cases I read on here. But for him, he is drinking beer every day when the sun goes down. Literally he cannot skip a day. I would guess he's probably drinking 7-8 coors lights every day and chain smoking while he's drinking. 

I think he's really depressed. I've tried to take him aside and explain to him my feelings, and he'll admit he should make a change, but I think he simply has no desire to change.

From my perspective he's wasting his life drinking so much... Damaging his health and giving up so many life activities that could be enjoyable for him that he doesn't pursue because he's medicating himself with alcohol. I think the underlying issue is that he's depressed, he doesn't have many good hobbies or close friends. Just works and looks forward to drinking at night.

Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation who could give some insight?",4.515823293172693,5.815899076305225,5.538333333333334,79.9941666666667,70.285140562249,8.90682730923695,29.09437751004016,9.2995712137729,2.51464016064257,1006,38,193,21,18,332,141,249,0.113,0.821,0.066,-0.8905,1,0,10,0,1,0,23.0,1,0,0,2,10,8,0,0,11,0,20,14,0,3,0,36,36,17,0,5,4,3,2,0,1,3,8,0,0,0,6,11,10,1,8,7,0,2,6,4,0,0,4,5,22,4,26,26,4,26,0,4,2,0,34,11,0,6,14,109,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08507655613859008,0.41027480528179994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06710835337496243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07379929272723264,0.0,0.058505819525314924,0.10599748184050826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20305886425549724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15325737359205208,0.0,0.0,0.18568891746496052,0.0,0.16532724371304186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700976246257424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.161727122158207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09047723022171986,0.0,0.04852813431273356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07415049093712622,0.0,0.0,0.18413703328673692,0.0,0.08049975852981159,0.0,0.0,0.10572791591631696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020175478881136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001735647518486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15646580614303615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13558077349406547,0.0,0.0,0.0847481908159838,0.0,0.08059531068359523,0.0,0.0,0.0815950014926847,0.0,0.0,0.06406444137619492,0.19460833757161816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09668529436979108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660678806681323,0.1020068470639762,0.0705530904971952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900665752941755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10656951776316244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10347790229782224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09600154705563987,0.0,0.12296882149840467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07648010703801836,0.0,0.0,0.10842508105213704,0.0,0.0,0.10788056718409243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229719267587407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07216168786832439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459890917809735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651611152205346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11544679920578267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06987136144669774,0.0,0.0,0.06817829459460023,0.0,0.0,0.12361024685064795
alcoholism,Maleyna,2020/02/04,"Guys i need help, withdrawals symptoms I've been a heavy drinker for a few years (19,F). I mean, getting piss drunk almost every night. At times i would replace my food intake of the day with just drinking alcohol (was going through a period of intense stress and my body wouldn't accept any solid food so i drank). 

I'm trying to quit but i can't go 2 days of being completely sober and i get bad withdrawal symptoms. 

My paranoia becomes very, very heightened, my heart races, my hands sweat-- it honestly scares me.

alcoholism,Bitchin-javelina,2020/02/05,"I can’t sleep because of my dad’s drinking I’m 25, graduated college in 2018, and am seeking employment related to my major. That being said, I’ve been at home living with my dad for the time since I’ve graduated to try and help him out. 

He doesn’t get super drunk every night (at least not for the past year or so) but he’s developed pretty severe panic/anxiety disorder which I’m 99% sure is related to short term effects from drinking. It’s a pretty often scenario for him to wake up in the middle of the night and come down to my room having anxiety for me to calm him down and try to decide if we go to the ER. On the worst night we do go to the ER, his BP is staggering (like stroke level), and he experiences extreme chest pains. 

I was feeling better about the situation recently as he agreed to taper his drinking and the decrease in anxiety was readily apparent, I felt like I had my dad back for the first time in years and could clearly communicate with him. A few weeks ago however I had to go on an emergency trip to help my girlfriend move and in the time I was gone he’s fallen into old habits.

Because of the many sleepless nights worried about him, the countless times he’s withdrawn or become angry with me for no reason, the hospital trips, etc. I think I’m a little traumatized by it all and now every time I see him having a drink it really messes up my mood and often my day never really comes back from the moment I see him drinking in excess of his taper goals.

I also can’t help but pay attention to how much he’s drinking as in my mind each drink increases the likelihood I will need to take him to the hospital between 2-6 AM (when the booze wears off and most anxiety attacks occur). At this point I’m not really sleeping unless I basically pass out from exhaustion which usually happens around 8 AM or so. I’ve tried to explain what’s going on but he responds with anger. 

I would appreciate any input. Thanks.

TL;DR parent has alcohol induced panic attacks and I can’t sleep because I may need to take them to the hospital any given night.",6.216100576217919,5.809625038554215,7.369848088004191,74.3618334206391,66.0843373493976,10.590885280251443,32.74227344159246,10.176274734539398,3.2218213724463065,1641,61,312,35,23,560,216,415,0.146,0.748,0.106,-0.9571,4,0,8,0,0,0,34.0,2,0,1,5,13,16,3,1,24,0,24,19,6,4,4,58,50,27,0,5,10,4,3,2,1,3,4,1,2,0,8,25,10,0,9,8,1,13,8,8,2,1,10,6,40,7,64,35,11,68,0,0,2,0,33,28,0,8,29,202,48,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06469617726897775,0.07799801947867885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0583655173849089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0992636518496819,0.0,0.2233311552724276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06497149950530309,0.0,0.16606035248962386,0.0,0.1122408414564522,0.0,0.13347165340510414,0.08060542394367327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06454868128584122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12573902189603886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05827202380840087,0.0,0.0,0.04706883488806577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364632949228587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5004777919049295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813967856943534,0.0,0.0,0.12298483905841814,0.0,0.0,0.07139264881906987,0.0,0.0,0.036903054408020164,0.0,0.07007637231810049,0.0,0.0,0.06208040727847758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03813128380914727,0.0,0.16591463573613302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06453977439786414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14675951113561486,0.0,0.07320920247621268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07131288363242581,0.07314944106468106,0.06444647297810688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07399462364840337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07369333630699143,0.0,0.0,0.07757075932351996,0.05365185730185357,0.10823386556467122,0.05628999057680263,0.0,0.0,0.3424541016769391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658474431407362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07766043970292939,0.1712626986012466,0.08104042671219121,0.0,0.06967177155378691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06899375297975947,0.0,0.0,0.14850254042505406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14026683205050655,0.07504001468812113,0.07206319017735263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06942478139868268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11631807367523815,0.0,0.0,0.08245148349358876,0.0,0.060373366169448224,0.08203740977773404,0.21911102157467932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06878683788889678,0.0,0.10975021938482343,0.0,0.0,0.0671941365887613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04676539169666147,0.0,0.0,0.21278865778343656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14865464421777855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0803818939883319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058543602155380174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411909817744375,0.0,0.05184595184839768,0.0,0.0,0.09399899109085104

He is doing a masters degree so normally after dinner, he'll go to the office room to study. After I've had that one glass, I have a thirst for more alcohol. I'll often give in and sneak some spirits out of our drinking cabinet and have a few more drinks. Maybe once or twice a week.  I just love the feeling of chilling by myself watching TV while I'm a little buzzed. I've taken it too far a few times and had a hangover the next day, and I always feel guilty when I do.

alcoholism,kungfuballoons,2020/02/05,"How do I get through the next 90 minutes without a drink? I've been battling drinking for a few years. I've cut down a lot - but I still find myself running out to my car at work every so often to chug a beer and suck down a cigarette during the last few hours of work. 

I've already went out once since 1pm and now I'm craving ""just one more"" before I clock out for the day. 

I still have tons of work to do on myself - but I used to actually drink IN the office, and be drunk before I even got to work in the morning, and completely wasted by the time I got back home. 

Now just maintaining a buzz is all I want/need. But I need to keep cutting down. I have to.

Please help.",2.6135862068965534,3.1234040482758623,4.062241379310347,91.76439655172415,74.0344827586207,6.90344827586207,24.15517241379311,6.742157984588678,0.5616068965517247,517,14,123,4,10,172,88,145,0.12,0.833,0.047,-0.8418,0,0,5,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,4,11,4,4,0,12,0,7,5,0,2,1,21,16,9,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,5,1,1,5,0,3,1,4,0,1,4,0,13,0,24,11,6,25,0,0,0,0,1,10,1,2,12,81,13,4,0.0,0.0,0.1453799115220027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16439965409861645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11455399877768024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2535366465558668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15619938862187274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09607774111932876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378217789902689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09839780174511024,0.0,0.12551941806884373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13616213829562496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07783425323943582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23830078607097854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09985603957281412,0.0,0.1494359233617972,0.0,0.1467121842039751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13241746579229402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12143601316008325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12665478700189053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046444362598117,0.0,0.0,0.15843856582036248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15865547890560922,0.10095056639678793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16353183999447285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12323518649069864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23794620330450356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686959693931183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12866816249916924,0.0,0.0,0.08787040362439798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381030287718293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14360836328731816,0.0,0.43382767275796935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959362044225438
alcoholism,throwaway02052020,2020/02/05,"Need some input/thoughts on my behavior from others that may understand and have suggestions 34 y/o male here.

My significant other is out of town on business every few months. I find myself getting excited about these times that I know he will be gone because this is how the process usually goes:
1) If I know he will be gone by the time I get off work, I have already made my mind up about what I am going to pickup on the way home to drink (recently switched from Bud Light to White Claw because I’m believing the lie I tell myself that it isn’t as bad for my health). I’m excited about it literally ALL DAY and can’t wait to get home and start feeling buzzed/drunk
2)I try to talk myself out of drinking that night multiple times throughout the day because I know I shouldn’t, and I know I will end up feeling like shit the next day because I have trouble stopping after “just a few”
3)step 2 goes out the window the second I start the trip home and pull into the gas station for my drink of choice
4)immediately chug 2 cans when I walk in the door to “get it going” quicker
5)after about 4-5 more I’m pretty intoxicated and switch from drinking to binge eating whatever sounds good at the time
6)call hubby and tell him I had 1 drink and a salad
7)full as a tick and drunk as a skunk I shuffle to bed and fall asleep
8)repeat steps 2-6 the next day if I know I will be home alone 

I do not drink every night and I have never been to therapy related to my drinking habits. I know this pattern of behavior is likely a good indicator of a substance abuse problem. I guess what I really want to know is does anybody experience similar feelings when it comes to drinking.... if so, how do you not give in? I know it’s bad for me and I keep doing it. Tonight he is out of town again 😐",6.861193528693532,5.4316674697802165,7.306007326007329,78.70010378510382,65.23626373626374,10.396581196581195,33.95848595848596,9.2995712137729,2.7629412698412694,1405,50,294,21,18,463,190,364,0.075,0.858,0.066,-0.7374,0,1,8,0,1,0,30.0,0,1,0,1,12,11,1,0,19,0,27,15,2,3,2,53,60,23,0,7,6,0,3,2,1,6,2,1,7,1,17,18,11,3,13,9,0,10,6,5,0,1,5,6,37,6,47,46,5,52,0,0,1,0,12,16,1,6,27,179,54,1,0.0,0.08913639399187842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07791659330068196,0.08301924277968628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12562943002829605,0.18344039676714552,0.0,0.0,0.08475953759736066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07681922859512944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0648048166331851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1940709999529501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06583512616147598,0.0,0.0,0.5895816551604804,0.0,0.07698006063419031,0.0,0.0,0.06663230699481222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12677066870191153,0.0,0.0,0.07359032138014356,0.0,0.0,0.11411711200172167,0.05374501782991063,0.0,0.0,0.06875974087989788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15722030077713373,0.07216839863047428,0.08551098444627335,0.1262003315582866,0.0,0.0,0.08287539172347054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799669999225863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30185117528623906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06686874009045603,0.0,0.0,0.3307597758629308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07350810078996822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07118535994865641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07596183069422571,0.0,0.06004864008422419,0.0,0.0,0.055782808754616935,0.05802275956352624,0.0,0.1600179736827886,0.14119833241779212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07653693942175449,0.0,0.07198587521915371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048194883835220984,0.0,0.07428150394404816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07722350648902279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064977312555234,0.0,0.0,0.06289645700040916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06046780154612541,0.13151036212874342,0.0,0.08603316716547009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059724984387716916,0.1754711273091155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05107688827721028,0.0,0.0,0.07831808977057375,0.0,0.0,0.082856281558304,0.0,0.04437317348166071,0.05971483986160572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05476903994523558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Ghettogurke,2020/02/05,"How much can my body and brain recover from my alcohol abuse? Hey everyone!   
I had serious issues with alcohol since I was only 16 years old and they went more severe with every year that passed. I drank until I blacked out most of the times and after work or when I was alone I was drinking every day at least in the evening to be able to sleep a few hours. I drank at least 3-4 beers (0,5l) every day and when I was out I was drinking until I totally blacked out. 

Now, about 10 years later, I met a person who changed my life entirely. I fell in love with a Muslim girl and everything went great. She accepted me the way I was, even tho I had crippling anxiety and I hated my body due to my drinking. Things went more serious and I learned about Islam and converted. I quit drinking totally, started to work on myself, workout etc.. and I never felt more amazing all of my life. It's been several months already without relapsing and I don't even feel a desire to do so. 

Now, after I have tortured my body and brain cells with alcohol for over 10 years, I wonder if there is a chance to regenerate completely from the heavy abuse or if there is some damage done that will never fully recover.  
I still have issues with my anxiety and also sometimes feel ""insufficient"". These mental issues were born by my past alcohol abuse, I am pretty sure about that.. but is there a chance to get rid of them by just continuing to workout and stay away from alcohol?

alcoholism,DayDreamNightScheme,2020/02/05,"Is it all or nothing? I’ve been drinking since i was 19. I’m 35 now. Female if it matters. I don’t drink liquor. I drink only light beer but i usually drink like 2-3 every night. Just about every night for like 9 years I’ve suddenly realized. Do you have to completely quit or take breaks?  This is probably a question for aa but just wanted some insight here. 

the problem is my mental health. Idk if it’s from drinking alcohol daily or what. I feel mentally numb. I feel nothing get no enjoyment out of life. I drink because I’m so bored. I am on antidepressants. I also have social anxiety that is probably worse from drinking because now it feels like i have to to be able to talk to people. 

Sorry all jumbled. Day three and not sure what my goal is here. To stop?  To just stop daily drinking. Am i an alcoholic?

alcoholism,AffablyBrusque,2020/02/05,"I am on the brink of a drinking problem I'm becoming more like my dad, who drank to cope with the failures in his life and, in the end, his illness that he knew he wouldn't survive. I'm using the same excuses he used to justify his drinking (I'm only drinking a little bit, I'm not as bad as others, this will be my last time in a while!). I'm using it to cope with my depression and anxiety. I feel liberated when I get a buzz going. All of my inhibitions and ruminations stop and it feels great. But then I get a ""moral hangover"" the next day and the guilt and shame of having given in to drink again wears me down, which leads to the cycle starting over again. Not to mention the money this is costing me when I have a lot of financial obligations to consider.

I loved my dad and I miss him dearly, but I don't want to become my dad.",3.3290380952380967,3.9762013657142887,5.134071428571428,84.22834523809523,72.48571428571428,8.347619047619048,27.154761904761905,8.59863814320734,1.7754476190476192,649,22,141,11,12,223,102,175,0.113,0.823,0.064,-0.4945,0,0,4,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,2,4,10,0,2,14,0,8,9,1,4,1,27,28,15,0,3,4,3,2,1,0,2,2,0,0,0,8,9,5,1,3,4,2,2,4,6,0,0,3,2,20,4,23,22,5,24,1,2,0,1,14,9,0,1,14,94,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11602422535942375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12663493915693955,0.0,0.3350067969307553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16558020561377018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09781214985068733,0.0,0.13062987299319534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5943005314318374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13433123337858086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15337397223828608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15847865598581282,0.0,0.08619539474281501,0.0,0.0,0.16721251730856015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12362819294150244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10712632004311236,0.0740964427601333,0.15200937324936248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12894117681377845,0.13688466398023308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16129872082339766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11534897694340708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14512406729033725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735011465751078,0.0,0.0,0.1267997316176618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843777897258852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3929726941357942,0.0,0.0,0.0894566523590021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,atransnobody,2020/02/05,"Seriously fucking struggling I can't be sober. I can't so it. Without something to make me feel good, to make me not care, I can't handle life. I'm severely depressed, anxious, and my meds aren't working anymore. I can't see my psychiatrist for another month and a half. I can't see my therapist currently. I'm losing it, I want to die. I'm just suffering, more and more every day, and it's only been four days. I told my girlfriend everything, about hiding it from her and shit. If I start hiding it again and she finds out it'll awful. If I just start drinking openly she'll feel like shit too. 

 I honestly feel I'm on the verge of suicide. More and more every day, it seems like a light at the end of the tunnel.

 Should I try to tell my girlfriend that the only thing keeping me alive is drinking?

alcoholism,uplight99122,2020/02/06,"Jaundice? I’m 21. The past 6 months have been quite hard for me and I’ve built up quite a bad drinking habit. I will drink like 10-12 units a night. I just noticed whilst looking in the mirror in the dark with a might in my face that my eyes are slightly yellow in the corners. They’re not like completely yellow, it’s very subtle but I’ve done some research and now I’m concerned. I don’t have any other symptoms like black poo, feeling ill, coughing blood etc. 

I’m not sure if this is down to the drinking or if it’s always been there, I’ve never really looked. I don’t have yellow skin at all (although I am quite oily coloured naturally so might be hard to tell). I also smoke weed quite a lot and I’ve seen that it can cause yellow eyes.

alcoholism,HellcatJD,2020/02/06,"Day 1....Again This will be my 10th time in the past few months that I've tried to stop drinking. I've got all of the great excuses (e.g. childhood trauma, sexual assault, abusive parents, absent parents, narcissistic parent, addict parent, worked in a bar, now a lawyer, etc.). However, my life is okay now. I have a beautiful family and a wonderful husband and I cannot manage to control my drinking. I'm tired of the anxiety and embarrassment. I'm ashamed and depressed. And I say all of this not knowing how to make it end. I woke up this morning after drinking myself into oblivion last night...and Sunday night....and at least this time I wasnt covered in vomit. But I still smell like alcohol and I can barely look at myself in the mirror. My husband isnt speaking to me. I couldn't take my 4yo to preschool. I called into work...again. 

I have to get it together. I am slowly killing myself and all of my relationships. This is all to say that hopefully, this is my last Day 1.",2.1850000000000023,4.620455497382204,3.826646596858641,84.6370379581152,80.413612565445,6.5425130890052365,25.7803664921466,7.734863291789972,1.6785139267015707,764,31,144,13,20,254,109,191,0.158,0.747,0.095,-0.91,5,0,4,0,0,1,44.0,0,0,0,2,4,10,2,2,8,1,13,9,0,3,4,23,24,9,1,2,2,6,0,1,0,1,5,3,0,0,10,9,5,2,2,4,0,0,5,6,0,0,3,5,22,4,21,18,7,25,0,1,1,0,12,9,0,2,17,94,32,4,0.0,0.1451990439690046,0.0,0.13359513565258213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309662750359936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937486929187678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12513495387154105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13744772148041445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15806632057521075,0.0,0.10555019704996488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3601504202036365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10854093193378986,0.0,0.13667313469679246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11552711173257435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06402614112771697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09801263020338163,0.1351093264253465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171756645842875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13558092783203715,0.0,0.06734903820974017,0.19978554410117813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08655909962016972,0.05987064026649488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10290924511778517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08180157437197844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09781644445547824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2300055225360489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5442990929647584,0.0,0.11698569343869608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315704207188553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949097781745772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09786679103037674,0.10245540588425774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214065634796348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14291715644099587,0.140850610516799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08320187764650118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328978067662728,0.1784324423057322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Billitpro,2020/02/06,"I Just wanted to share 24 years today! And as I have said in the past I share for pride but also to show others that you can stop killing yourself and the lives of those around you but getting clean and sober. Also as I have said in the past I have gone through, cancer treatments, spine surgery, getting downsized, losing people I loved very much (Granny last year), as well as saying good-bye to our two cats that were basically our children (CRUSHED and still crushes me) and many other things and I still didn't pick up so it is possible you just have to want it bad enough and reach out for help when you need it.

I don't ever want to be that lost, psychotic, unstable addict I once was.

alcoholism,Melanoma_man,2020/02/06,"I use to be a problem drinker my self. But this post is regarding my mum who has been a alcoholic since I can remember. I’ve never seen alcohol affect anyone quite like it  does with my mum. She literally transforms into a vicious crone, and I imagine if she was born the 17th or 16th centuries, she would of been accused of being a witch and burnt alive at the stake..

My mum is a very abusive alcoholic. During my childhood she use to beat me black and blue and my younger brother nearly died as a baby due to neglect. 

At one time she left the grill on and left the house to get more alcohol and the house filled up with black smoke and me and my brother could of died, if it wasn’t for a neighbour kicking the door in and rescuing us.
One time me and my brother was in my step dads car (my brother is my half brother) and she was drunk as usual and crashed into another car.. luckily no one was hurt.

My childhood memories was filled with an empty stomach due to neglect and the beatings.

After failing to pick me up from school on time and the new head teacher saw for himself how drunk she was and her being abusive to the other teachers. Social services got involved and finally put me and my brother info care.

She still drinks to this day. Just last year she caused a fire by falling asleep with a cigarette and one of her dogs died in the fire.

She’s a mess.

She’s never worked either since I can remember and just parasitises from the state, family, neighbours and myself.  I use to transfer her money but stopped enabling her.

Since I’ve had cancer she still tries to scrounge money from me and got jealous of other family members supporting me and not her. 

I still work even tho I have cancer and she complains about being destitute and that she’s the victim..

My mum is beyond help. She really is. My brother has cut her off completely and so has most of her siblings.

I’m thinking of doing the same",4.715928805237315,5.7664984734042575,5.30212765957447,82.80653846153848,69.58510638297872,8.018657937806875,30.68494271685761,8.263242389622931,2.2144851882160403,1510,61,289,21,26,486,188,376,0.163,0.799,0.038,-0.9911,0,0,8,0,0,0,32.0,1,0,0,7,11,15,4,0,24,0,28,12,3,7,2,62,40,35,3,5,9,12,2,1,2,1,6,0,1,1,8,31,7,3,5,3,2,7,5,12,0,5,14,7,54,3,45,20,4,46,0,4,5,0,44,16,0,4,22,211,62,6,0.0,0.2190711338935195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951944804825335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09693961536616794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06464167554680947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942567288096484,0.09496939217284538,0.0,0.0,0.09692979579730836,0.0,0.0,0.0738120734652815,0.0,0.0,0.0596212053678878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2878387703873158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090172314762673,0.0,0.0,0.09056368275523967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06106092292810675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743031818315621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10127208410776722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048300177991081085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478779573722577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09487814961100532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061965834887816276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2133447779374829,0.0989673191061331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535732413486441,0.0,0.0,0.2008896858171456,0.0,0.0,0.04516534231765285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14260293870953436,0.0892866948395671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2505801814666783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08853947070807587,0.0,0.0,0.08846009246242495,0.0,0.09293560814446827,0.0,0.09832965184048838,0.0,0.0,0.059224450175818774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094507501908749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935621442784792,0.0,0.0,0.0964432537236502,0.0,0.0,0.22942141259919,0.0,0.0,0.09423892525409826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22148688065179145,0.07729052935560793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10490870726983206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05923683960070391,0.0,0.0,0.1617212275914673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06276601133124471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11120336235164023,0.2395357400569159,0.1018182289987646,0.07627914555429663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13460624943112953,0.0,0.0,0.06567228931835506,0.0,0.0,0.05953337453040351
alcoholism,pauv-djab,2020/02/06,"I am stopping today but I’m worried that I’ll get withdrawals. Details below. Hi. Just wondering if anyone might be able to tell me what to expect. For the past 4 months I’ve had at least 4-8 beers basically every night.  Sometimes 10-12, sometimes with hard liquor too. I’m like 5’7” and 125 pounds for context. Hangovers have gone away and I take that to be due to a higher tolerance.  

If I quit cold turkey today, what should I expect? Just like anxiety and insomnia? I’m worried about something worse. As it is, I think I’m stopping at a good point as I don’t get the shakes if I don’t drink, but I basically wake up thinking only of my first beer. 

Thanks in advance for any responses.",1.7982425488180915,4.019467719424462,3.392934224049334,88.420809352518,80.43884892086331,5.9858170606372045,24.31706063720452,7.1686216300943375,1.061460020554985,539,20,109,7,14,178,94,139,0.11900000000000001,0.757,0.124,0.5803,0,0,4,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,3,4,5,0,1,4,0,10,6,1,0,0,20,22,10,0,6,7,0,1,2,0,2,1,0,0,0,5,4,4,2,3,4,0,3,2,1,0,1,2,2,10,4,18,16,1,19,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,5,11,60,15,0,0.16534689640075356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244155953918816,0.0,0.1264899231722191,0.0,0.0,0.11561439447023908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15534885205550095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16197701025184302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393118915708007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406439856109798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1727738578558312,0.0,0.0,0.1386851318705872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14811834173479488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16156028317413348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1754069275278295,0.0,0.0,0.13197831520567402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15516686136616334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575376552928272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15784232200582596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563062619387305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17586677727397804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12729211896777465,0.3270646168990774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2764748182698955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243202884182135,0.0,0.14452047541372626,0.1522292071496815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118952295970951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3134590485655611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17931165592023926,0.0,0.33583559884863057,0.1685026134129205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,donotdlsturb,2020/02/06,"IOP experts please help Hi, 

Yesterday I received a call from my best friend sobbing and saying she’s going into 5 day detox. She had IOP earlier that day and I’m wondering if that has to do with it, since she’s been so adamant about no detox or rehab. She’s been relapsing for about 4 days prior to this. Can IOP force you to go into a detox program if you relapse? I don’t see her confessing that she relapsed to the counselors there, so would she have to show up drunk? I’m very happy she’s there but I am so unsettled by not knowing how she ended up there. 

I know every place is different but I would really your stories and knowledge about IOP and relapsing rules, and what happens in detox after IOP. I’m so lost and scared and her parents are too overwhelmed to tell me what happened (I live across the country). 

thank you.",2.290306886227544,4.461386275449101,3.318948353293411,89.85770396706587,78.46107784431138,6.330688622754493,24.80875748502994,7.413659706084162,1.1726649700598806,656,24,133,9,16,210,105,167,0.105,0.8059999999999999,0.09,-0.6772,2,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,4,0,2,12,8,0,2,4,0,13,6,0,1,0,25,26,17,0,4,6,1,0,0,1,2,5,1,0,0,7,10,1,0,5,2,0,3,3,4,0,0,4,2,22,4,20,20,1,17,1,3,1,0,23,7,1,5,7,90,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18961110160335368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18449310800316127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34956835621821697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18877073915085446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16002766020580833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522295595788997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395918807839258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2053676869374761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31954707611534344,0.19233578812388824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12110509401123375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985925274419188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15954256269279793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1972320954055375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20062226467805472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18877073915085446,0.19833090658396654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11574737303695068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14368291849353776,0.18089085346151626,0.0,0.1439774956182738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14945925063015578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15792110834403406,0.1663446307285533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490788127066131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19593829428572976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566978654037662,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sober here a year. I am involved in my 12 step recovery program.  I have a sponsor,  working on steps, going to 6 meetings a week, I go on commitments weekly.  But I have hit a wall with my recovery program.  It's not that I dont want to go to or be apart of my recovery program anymore, but I have reached a point where I'm frustrated with a lot of things and honestly just tired. 

I put my recovery absolutely first before anything I do, but I'm feeling exhausted.  I'm not sure if this a slump, boredom or what is is. I'm cranky and tired and need to get over it asap.

alcoholism,littlebaggyofpot,2020/02/07,"3 months post liver transplant and just found him drinking My MIL's brother is an alcoholic. He ya been for 35 years, but he was diagnosed with liver failure. He was got sober, and we were all so happy. He got a liver transplant after thanksgiving (we actually got the call at thanksgiving dinner!!) 

Unfortunately, his wife died 3 days ago. He was doing SO well, and now it's like he has taken a million steps backwards, completely understandably. He was still sober though, but very sad. He lived with his wife, but now he lives alone. He had been with the family the past 3 days, but today my MIL's family went back home and she had work. After work she stopped by his place to check in and found beer all over, and him very intoxicated. 

He had no remorse. I understand. His motivation was her. He is motivated himself as well, but he his carrot of motivation was to get his license back and take her to the beach. 

My MIL put everything into getting him a new liver and his recovery. She is on the board of a non-profit rehabilitation center (she was long before because she cares deeply about helping addiction). He goes to the center for outpatient and has a sponsor. She is devastated. He is not remorseful at all and seems like he's lost all motivation. 

Does anyone have advice for this situation? I want to be able to support my MIL and her brother, but I'm at a loss. Thank you so much",3.6906399609184177,5.764474670411989,5.068477446669924,79.40048851978506,73.8314606741573,8.238983878847094,26.21543722520762,8.964715089967882,2.152378407425501,1095,39,208,24,23,365,144,267,0.12300000000000001,0.71,0.16699999999999998,0.9337,0,1,3,0,0,0,38.0,2,2,0,8,13,11,0,0,13,0,23,11,4,4,4,40,42,22,1,1,8,4,0,2,0,0,4,0,1,0,2,17,4,1,9,3,1,3,2,3,2,1,21,0,30,8,26,20,5,32,0,3,0,0,46,11,0,1,19,131,32,6,0.1174852012969106,0.0,0.11464860902175245,0.12807621088066246,0.0,0.11480517898471887,0.10414354229829627,0.12555595065515807,0.0,0.12167923686074435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214838441379152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18067773573727716,0.0,0.07161788825238287,0.0,0.0999712531097205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11996552615711716,0.0,0.11978399270041305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12318099831031705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15153647105660764,0.0,0.0,0.11924500627230522,0.1219310904250293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028120913737268,0.0,0.0,0.1150907701877058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055881234361522,0.0,0.2215091837351499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2576329183778917,0.0,0.0,0.12276233730954768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28189094386358515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250651814090025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07874785394756237,0.0,0.11784723605859597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11479466989386107,0.0,0.20748317034767927,0.1039707061040856,0.0,0.0,0.12824897556601736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09377556680099296,0.0,0.0863651409737463,0.0,0.0,0.11346793950918367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11215291836552264,0.0,0.0,0.12274702990483595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11251834693322156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118105076933732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069541148251341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13205828869469935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09382383351753414,0.09822288892329466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13332081416911004,0.0,0.0,0.08833425016157262,0.0,0.0,0.10816458871959768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11542861376926655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11136223364545472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24461247577648584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1938751902311789,0.06929581566152274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21126661074276945,0.10890995863610066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1710612515722902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07565661773158043

alcoholism,Several-Steak,2020/02/07,"I can't stop It's like crack. Its ruined relationships, jobs, everything. I'm self medicating and badly because of severe anxiety. I'm only 32. I don't want to die in a hospital a year from now. My brand new job is about to fire me because I SHOWED UP DRUNK to handle the pressure. I don't even know how to function or be normal anymore without a few drinks and after those drinks it's not even me. It's so flailing buffoon that just makes an embarrassing ass out of myself. It's killing me and I couldn't care less because it's conversely what keeps me going. I crave it as soon as I wake up. There are obviously deeper implications and I've previously given therapy a shot but I never got much out of it. I made an appointment to see a substance abuse counselor and a psychiatrist but I cancelled at the last minute. I'm due back February 13th and I think I'm putting my eggs in a basket preemptively but I'm otherwise lost.

It takes about 2 hours to fall asleep because I always jerk awake every time I dose off. My dreams are so weird and I wake up often during the night. The weirdest thing is that while I’m coming out of sleeping increments, everything seems so existential weird, like a what the fuck is the universe and who am I type of weird.

A few minutes after I look around the room and wake up, things start going back to normal though.

alcoholism,nchlaz,2020/02/07,"I hate this. Rant ahead.

Alcoholism is beyond a disease. I've woken up from a blackout literally every single day for ELEVEN months. I'm exhausted. I wake up and commit to stopping, about to dump out all alcohol and give my roommate my wallet so I don't buy more, more strongly than I’ve ever felt anything and then, literally minutes later, the desire to quit fades and my brain reminds me to take another shot before work. You can handle 9 shots before work, it’s no big deal. Coworkers tell me I smell like alcohol and I feel so dead inside I don’t care at all. My mom gives me 30 days to move out and I still don’t stop drinking. I have no life outside of this illness, on days off from work I'm drunk by 6am.  I’ve been to jail twice from drinking related offenses, and the 10 minute ride home from work is insanely painful as I make my Uber speed so I can be home and take that first shot. It feels like it will never stop. I’m only 21 and I already drink enough to buy a 1.75 liter of vodka every 2 days and I get DTs when I stop. I make it three days before the withdrawal, insomnia, and insanely scary dreams drive me to drink. I just want this nightmare to be over. I miss being happy. I know it’s my own fault but I hate my birth family for all being drunks. I just don't know what to do as I can't afford rehab. Sigh.

alcoholism,heavensakes123,2020/02/07,"please help. fears. I am a 20 yr old female in an alcoholic family. Pretty much all the males on my dad’s side are alcoholics, and my father happens to be the worst. I still live at home putting myself thru college with my mom and dad. To give a bit of background, my father and I have no real relationship due to his alcoholism. He lost his job in 2008-09’ and his abuse of alcohol got worse. My mom and older brother tried talking to him to get him to go to AA, and even reached out to his own mom &amp; dad to talk to him. They don’t believe he has a problem. My dad &amp; I used to be close but those memories of me being 5-6 years old are fading. I’ve tried my best to talk to him about myself because he really doesn’t know me anymore. I constantly struggle with the ‘blame’ part. I blame myself, then I blame him, and the whole thing goes back a forth. My dad has decided to spring on my mom that he wants a ‘consensual divorce’ 
meaning they’d still live under the same roof, be separated, &amp; pay bills split equally. I already advised my mom to have the papers he presents her with to be looked over by a lawyer. They’d only live together until I get out of college, so I’m the ticking time bomb. With all this in mind, it is extremely hard for me to deal with turning 21 this year. I don’t know if anyone has felt this way about their 21st (if you have an alcoholic parent) but I am not excited about it at all. My friends all really want to have a party for me and I already told them I don’t need a project X party.  For me it just comes with the reminder that I can now do what my father legally does, drink &amp; drive, fall down the stairs, into bushes, fall asleep in my driveway, and so on. Yes he has done all of those. I just feel quite alone and feel guilty for not even being excited for my own birthday, especially an age that is so glorified by everyone. 
Has anyone else felt this way?

alcoholism,xREDSAUCEx,2020/02/07,"I'm trying to quit tomorrow 
I spent 6 months sober then...
I started drinking again.
 I'm drunk now
I can't stop now.
I feel like I need a drink every day and it's scaring me. I'm hiding it from my family. 
I know I have to stop... 
I'm going to sleep now but I just want to try and stop tomorrow. 
Last night my son couldn't wake me and neither could my parents. It worried all of them. 
I'm so much better than this. I know it. 
I am an alcoholic.
I have to admit that to myself. 
I just want to be normal. 
I feel horrible. 

I have to stop but I don't want to burden my family. 
Feel like hammered shit every day. Fucking feels like I am a total failure all the time. 
Good night.

alcoholism,DirectAirline,2020/02/07,"My moms alcoholism is getting worse. So my mom has been a heavy drinker for a while. For the past couple of years she usually has her first glass of wine at about 4 or 5 pm and keeps going until she goes to bed. This means, since I was unable to drive yet, I was trapped at home every day after 4 pm. If I had asked her to drive me somewhere she definitely would because she either doesn’t believe she’s intoxicated or thinks I just don’t notice, but I knew what was up so I just never asked to be driven around in the evening.  But in the past 6 months or so, it’s gotten bad. I’m older now so whenever I’m with her I can thankfully offer to drive. She doesn’t just drink at night anymore, it can be any time of day. Some times she actually drank WHILE driving me around. I think she really truly is convinced that I don’t notice, despite how painfully obvious it is due to how bad she is at hiding her drinking, despite how hard she tries to hide it. She’s never uttered the world alcohol, drunk, or let me writhing 5 feet of one of her drinks since the beginning of her disease. She almost never appears drunk though, because she must have an extremely high tolerance at this point. I’m guessing the recent increase in drinking is just to avoid withdrawals. Thankfully I only have to deal with this every other week since my parents are divorced and have split custody. Sometimes I reallly want to vent to my dad but I know he’d make a whole big deal out of it and something big would happen. I don’t want any confrontation or burnt bridges, and I know for a fact this would happen if she knew I was talking about her drinking. Idk it’s just kind of disheartening that she’s so careless about my life that she drove me around drunk or so clueless that she doesn’t see the risk.  I don’t really know what to do at this point. Either she’s in extreme denial or delusion, or simply just doesn’t care anymore. I’ll be off at college soon and won’t have to worry about it. I’m positive the liver disease and brain damage will catch up to her soon, and hopefully be a big wake up call.",5.056616842872764,5.310488573459717,5.615829383886258,83.70863652934746,68.478672985782,8.38804228946409,29.50091141086401,8.139509932561175,1.8578841414509657,1646,56,338,20,26,532,201,422,0.13,0.77,0.1,-0.9249,1,2,10,0,1,0,34.0,0,0,0,2,28,15,1,2,14,0,41,19,4,4,6,64,75,33,0,9,21,4,1,0,0,6,5,0,2,0,19,13,12,2,8,9,0,10,12,9,0,2,12,2,52,6,52,51,5,63,0,2,1,0,39,26,0,15,27,229,71,1,0.0,0.0,0.08169411754786055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17893252572667062,0.0838288427144376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11385863421296022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16604628888487433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22357326348352166,0.15652512607060298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13979766150502038,0.1020642157169065,0.0,0.0,0.09431854577139312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09345403069284716,0.08548274487753277,0.0,0.08535339123183751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262945612647988,0.0,0.1079789662074109,0.1726137252659637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41004592156038894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055293207280563736,0.0,0.14106760675395288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120824443186574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04373782159325407,0.0,0.04757736963340788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09222190975987224,0.0,0.14805843686833764,0.0,0.07499252127472768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08844987659395391,0.08397333415039326,0.08314824402589499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0744100605274357,0.0,0.08717666739963313,0.1380233213720733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08560462987173019,0.05913063617105555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05588065441570168,0.0,0.0,0.0911905715767758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19609284114730904,0.06682080352064326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1936993449517852,0.0,0.0,0.07856119651251266,0.0,0.0,0.1906209897487287,0.0,0.0,0.0567276960853985,0.06366930541065112,0.08907904789100128,0.0,0.09295600282224714,0.0,0.15983157186931504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15827615319649238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10726040952589656,0.0,0.08265882080428892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06671030511249289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20775063843012365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06444817588417234,0.08279663394061924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06728723715927093,0.0,0.15414771623959705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072828478057459,0.08224991844309179,0.0,0.09763020199144007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05683723580134779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09220064438916528,0.0,0.09875497938493492,0.0,0.06715141402829483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934652123934761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08501701408648203,0.0853131062177372,0.17840697446439086,0.0,0.0,0.0539099486245368

There were times when I nearly caved in, but being sober - after a 30 year struggle with booze - feels great!",5.880000000000003,7.534544536231888,5.1833043478260885,82.4801739130435,67.40579710144928,7.259130434782609,29.74202898550725,7.554174236665415,1.9243889855072465,299,11,51,3,5,90,57,69,0.044000000000000004,0.8240000000000001,0.132,0.7835,1,0,2,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,1,7,0,3,5,0,0,1,6,6,3,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,4,0,1,4,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,3,2,10,2,2,17,0,0,0,1,1,5,0,0,12,32,5,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22854101717551786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15687587579940418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4765840261089286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229943123448562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1945489354924605,0.26818355528885324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21954227136594648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23493199045142776,0.0,0.22827328209600256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25429730896339425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16160423311781524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28368160911006624,0.0,0.23057218915415426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951201656556356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344839449840557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3132895489490121

I wanted to stop multiple times on my way home and grab some wine. I mentally and visually clocked all of my old stores... but I kept driving.  Today I woke up clear headed and focused on how to get what I need to done instead of hungover and lethargic all day. THIS sub has been a life line. Thank you.

For the last year and a half I’ve been self medicating with hard stuff, vodka

alcoholism,greystone15,2020/02/08,"Anyone who identifies as an alcoholic- did you see this coming? I hope this post isn’t triggering for anyone but I’m not sure how else to ask the question.

I’m 22 and about 6 months ago, I went through a devastating breakup. Maybe a year before the breakup, I was a senior and college and having the most stressful year academically, socially and pressure wise (starting a job). I’ve been drinking since I was a teenager but that year was the first time I started using alcohol as an “escape” but it was pretty mild. Mostly just drinking more wine than normal as a way to chill out when stressed.

Then the breakup hits. This is when I started to drink more heavily. Again I’m not sure I’d say it was outrageous but I probably would drink every day at this point which has continued to now. I’m not an emotional wreck anymore but when I drink I just zone out in a way that I can’t manage to do without it.

It’s not at a point where I feel any physical drive to drink or any negative side effects if I don’t. If I’m in a good mood or have a distracted and busy day it’s not like I notice I haven’t had anything to drink. It also hasn’t affected how I drink socially. I’m not drinking more quantity wise during nights out. If anything I’m less of a crazy partner than I was as a teen. But I’ve been having this feeling lately where I really feel like one day I’ll have to be completely sober. 

I wasn’t raised in an alcoholic home. My mom never really drinks. My dad recently stopped cold turkey. I ask him about it and he was pretty nonchalant and just said it didn’t do much for him anymore. My mom alluded in private that he was drinking every day so he just cut it out. I’m starting to feel like thats how I’ll be. But for right now, it’s so social and now habitual that I don’t see myself realistically stopping.

I see the drinking habits of friends though and I don’t feel out of the ordinary. Mostly everyone drinks often since we are so young and I live in a very drinking- friendly area. I guess I just get freaked out since I live in a one bedroom now and see the amount of alcohol I go though. 

Not sure what I’m asking for, just the first time I’m putting it to words i guess?",1.7905042189750981,3.8111652123893833,3.4683844412430567,88.91835254167528,79.39823008849558,6.859518419427865,24.67091994237497,7.900780265707199,1.34099551348014,1724,64,368,30,43,573,197,452,0.135,0.779,0.086,-0.9599,1,0,19,0,0,0,36.0,1,1,0,3,28,20,2,4,27,0,33,19,0,7,4,74,69,40,0,6,26,3,5,3,3,1,4,2,2,1,24,19,19,2,7,15,0,5,19,7,0,4,16,12,36,12,42,49,9,64,0,0,4,0,23,21,0,13,38,233,60,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04636469723795509,0.2235899993444055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04182781204269851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07113757503182695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10374382598170688,0.07314490918742067,0.0,0.08608413380330485,0.0,0.14669266820011942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04450719440342097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04505561168605475,0.054840171229900064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349280511493164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7173376318516754,0.0,0.0,0.04369361700654178,0.05883541319882307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08813743050219465,0.04997909835595229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13223338820082606,0.0747325516592709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08898019664774658,0.0,0.0,0.08082050375299936,0.0,0.027326891691843342,0.0,0.029725797481314462,0.04387045152466206,0.0,0.0,0.1152383931261759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052465580674568746,0.05195007378266511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05190404910281037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0590016446068827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07665986766968658,0.0,0.09237149191245232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052546802828039335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12251656887285038,0.041748875322409694,0.0,0.03844975429865481,0.0,0.04034037992337838,0.0,0.0,0.0490841388545554,0.05124720949300588,0.0,0.059548909288373364,0.0,0.0,0.07088563400663672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888913389479943,0.0,0.0500931596347223,0.1064247628920782,0.05639299271871931,0.0,0.0,0.052580371412884616,0.05859290158977382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06701507956191892,0.0,0.051644287740262765,0.0,0.0,0.04466767422679575,0.04975346467502344,0.041594560472051706,0.0,0.0,0.16671934871306765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12980022754875656,0.0,0.0,0.15995325549628406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14808530211742207,0.0,0.0,0.08745764559691475,0.11982903343755087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478888419982866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027776204246982,0.0,0.06099823581712997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045174210510981236,0.0,0.04315661009144785,0.0,0.08303360078706591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04848670543486619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050419577837063335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03715554708078874,0.0,0.0,0.10104696165774116
alcoholism,Oh_my_Japanese_Boy,2020/02/08,"Got my ass beaten last night. I go wild when I'm drunk. I become a real child. When I'm sober I'm the most awkward, reserved and anxious guy within a 10 mile radius - so imagine everyone's shock to find me on the dancefloor, groping chicks I normally wouldn't have heart enough to talk to, screaming, shouting. The works.

I talk to this one girl who is kinda cute, she's receptive at least. Gives me her number etc. After a while talking to her there comes this guy, a guy who's friends with a kid who decided to make me his enemy after being a dumb drunk when I walked past their argument and said ""well? What are you waiting for? Fuck each other up!"" - it really wasn't smart. This guy is apparently dating her. I didn't buy it but didn't care either way because a friend of the girl rather loudly said ""you're a whore"" to her and turned me off. 

Kid joined in on the conversation, a conversation that was going reasonably well and escalated things and I ended up giving in and fighting him outside. Now I look like a potato. My body is sore now and I can hardly chew any food. I don't like that I even went that low. I don't like how vicious I became. I wanted to kill him. I gouged his left eye and bit a chunk of his ear off, even grabbed and squeezed his balls. Anyway, I didn't think I was like that until I got to the point. 

Fuck. I'm such a nervous person when sober. I make these stupid commitments to people all ye time when drunk. I make a bloody fool of myself. And I always grope some girl for some damn reason.",1.2437289291630125,3.4825498456591646,2.6552294650686967,92.81151612588913,82.69774919614147,5.441722693169639,18.74900126668616,6.714681859716394,0.037807288317256216,1186,29,255,13,33,384,179,311,0.23,0.6729999999999999,0.098,-0.9918,1,0,0,0,2,0,41.0,0,2,1,2,17,27,9,2,19,0,16,14,5,6,2,37,41,20,1,4,3,0,3,4,2,1,1,6,0,12,16,13,5,1,6,4,1,5,7,16,2,1,11,11,42,11,29,28,10,37,0,1,2,4,41,14,5,4,21,161,58,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08879727044196352,0.0,0.0,0.07257136456476124,0.0,0.0,0.12056007523438295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0650538227426317,0.11786077779551675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11650755745838977,0.11853876635427432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088053113361394,0.0,0.0,0.09192742991011743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09451977567788346,0.11026740869617233,0.11901790230264618,0.14097142588263886,0.0,0.0,0.1019728706182388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09753759965332348,0.0,0.12904287798064426,0.0,0.16489890861594467,0.1973166882410504,0.0,0.20474575043951546,0.12129970328786628,0.0,0.17070300863224785,0.0,0.0,0.4226672770774608,0.0,0.0,0.09559766176150727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12646041163889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11806678509726334,0.0,0.0,0.08698877223408366,0.0,0.0,0.11594856455126798,0.0,0.0,0.20854655978566047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08961558179403542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2137037057444896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10014687550335014,0.1045602108697044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07231434562674262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018736554435728,0.07398427878414851,0.0931813544193114,0.0,0.0,0.10088226066410334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12146755215955635,0.06836577952015686,0.21944613809386573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20302501577686216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25732576113503913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07089817461886673,0.06838008126019098,0.0,0.0,0.062227665299410324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1160776835016932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294457737939227,0.08470715667700278,0.0,0.0,0.19190318204110704,0.09892792592616706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07769140231209093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Consistent-Luck,2020/02/08,"How to fix myself and a family member I’m 23 and when I drink I go all out. If my friends pass out I still fill the need to find a party so I can drink but I never feel the need to drink alone., I won’t allow myself to do that. Cause I see no benefit. 

My mother’s an alcoholic she lays in bed and drinks till she knows she will get caught by the rest of the family.  My dad supports her and she realizes she has no responsibilities besides paying bills. She refuses to eat. She flushed food down the drain when I try to make her eat. 

My dad drinks excessively but he’s a functioning alcoholic. He makes great money and never misses a day on the job and always shows up to his hobbies well prepared. 

Divorce is coming soon. I‘be almost made my mom start going to therapy and I thought it was working till she started closer drinking and blew a .22 at 3pm. (We bought a breathalyzer during her last bender). My mom goes to AA (or at least says she does).

I don’t want to end up like my parents. I only drink socially with my friends because that’s what I’ve restricted myself to . I constantly feel the urge to drink. I try to fill that void with eating right and going to the gym. But when I’m away my mom goes to the liquor store.

alcoholism,littlebobbypin,2020/02/08,"I know I’m an alcoholic and I can’t stop I won’t go into much detail because you all know the feeling. I used to drink a fifth every night for about 2 years. I also had a serious drug problem with Cocaine and countless amphetamines alongside the booze. I’ve been through 3 separate rehabs ( most of which focused on the stimulants rather than the booze ), and things started getting better. After a few months I moved. For the past 6 months I have been regulating my alcohol intake because I’ve convinced myself that I’m not an alcohol but a “heavy drinker”, but I can sense the impending doom that is to come. I went from a fifth to 12 pack, to 8, to a six pack, to 3-5 a night. But as much as I tell myself “you’re making progress”, I still have cheat days where I slam booze like a fucking WWE superstar... I know I’ve made progress but the fact of the matter is I still need alcohol to cope with everyday life. It doesn’t matter if the amount I consume decreases; it’s the fact that I need it in the first place that is mentally exhausting. I’m looking for support, advice; really anyone who has been here and came out on top. 

Side note I’m also undergoing Ketamine treatments at a local clinic and it has helped tremendously with my anxiety/depression. I’d like to think it’s the reason I’ve slowed down on my drinking but I can’t make that conclusion yet. I’m kind of new to posting on reddit so if I am breaking any rules please let me know.

If they accept me, I need to stay somewhere nearby until the transplant happens, and then rehab in their clinic.  If not, no transplant for me, so guess I'll just die.

alcoholism,gogginsHiggins,2020/02/08,"1 year Sober today. The Good and the Bad. Hey! I'm pretty new here. As the headline reads. I haven't had a drink for a year today. 
I'm pretty pleased with myself. I'd been to detox hospital and Rehab for 4 and a half months before for drink and various drugs. Lasted nearly 2 years that time. That was a long time ago. This time last year i noticed most of the few people around me weren't drinking. I was, usually pretty soon after i woke up and until i passed out. I did nothing else really. Sat at home ill and drunk and miserable so decided to try again. 
 Anyway.. i slowed down, got some extra anxiety meds and spent a few weeks feeling awful at home. 
I know you shouldn't do it that way and wouldn't recommend it but I felt I couldn't put my family through me disappearing for another long stay away sorting myself out. 
Some good things to come out of it are, 
Though i live alone and am never at 100% health I have manage to see the people closest to me a bit more.
I wake up and can get up (not always immediately but i never could), 
I eat food.. sometimes really nice food too that i cook! 
I still like staying in the majority of the time but i have a better outlook on it. I choose what i do and make better decisions.
I learned mindfulness and meditation. 

There's probably more.. but people don't often talk about the bad points of giving up so i have a few.

Those people you got wasted with before either aren't as fun to be around or we had nothing in common other than getting wasted in the first place.

It is harder to be social. People drink anywhere and most of my hobbies (that i rediscovered last time i quit) involve a drinking culture so I've had to either change how i approach the hobbies or stop them all together. Also a lot of the reasons i drunk are still there. Social anxiety etc..

This one is on me, but i substituted drinking for chocolate therefore putting on weight. Everyone needs some sort of vice right? .. I see it as a treat. In the next year I'm going to change that for light exercise instead.

Putting up with others when they're drunk is awkward. People change after a few drinks. Not being on the same ride is hard.

Drinking culture is a thing, it probably always will be. 
People seem to drink to be able to put up with being around others in otherwise boring situations. There are a lot of them.

Being consumed with temptation is another thing that comes and goes albeit less frequently as time goes on. (Mindfulness really helps here). 

People i haven't seen for a long time assume I'm the same person i was when drinking. Have felt concern, looked down upon, pity and all sorts from others. It's quite hard to know people still feel that way, when i know I'm better. 

Sleeping is hard when you have always knocked yourself out. Frustrating at first but though it hasn't got much better. Netflix is good for that!

This is long and no one has probably made it to the end. Just a few thoughts i felt like getting written down. Kind of therapy ha ha. 
If anyone can relate, great. Anyone got any similar feelings be great to hear them! 
What did you change? Was there any things you had thought it'd be like and it wasn't? Are you working on quitting now? 
On the whole things are better. A lot is the same, there's new problems but i can handle life a little better and at least see things for how they are and am able to step back and look at life with a clear head. I feel like I have a part of me missing, but i have new parts unlocked! 
I'm going to carry on with it. Hope you're doing well and thanks for giving me a pkace to write.

alcoholism,Hannwhitco,2020/02/09,"I want to quit drinking, I need to quit drinking, but sometimes I just stop caring about myself. I (27f) have been drinking relatively consistently since college. I had periods of drinking every day post-graduation from 2014-2015 and again after a recent trauma in 2018. For the past few years I basically drink everyday. I only drink at night though. I can go through a handle of vodka in 3 days and I am a small person. I have had many moments when I want to quit. Maybe, if I'm lucky, I go without alcohol for 4 days. 

I am extremely depressed. I don't want to get into detail but I've been in some horrific situations. I know I need therapy but I don't think I have the time due to my work schedule or the money despite working so much. 

I know I want to quit alcohol but sometimes I just lose the motivation. I guess what I want to ask is: how do I quit when sometimes I legitimately don't care if it kills me? Some days I hate myself and everything so much I just want to be numb. How do I keep myself motivated? 

I just don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice? Any tips besides the typical ones I always hear? Anything you guys have learned to help keep yourself strong over the years? What have you guys found that helps keep you positive and motivated?",2.4544047619047618,4.6441036468254016,4.191507936507939,83.71321428571432,78.00793650793649,7.215873015873015,25.579365079365076,8.212053250817874,1.7260365079365072,997,38,198,19,24,335,135,252,0.14,0.693,0.168,0.3353,0,0,9,0,0,0,29.0,0,3,0,12,13,10,2,0,9,0,22,9,0,5,0,44,48,18,1,10,12,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,3,5,5,8,4,9,7,1,2,5,6,0,1,5,1,38,4,25,42,5,29,0,2,0,0,10,7,0,7,20,128,43,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.078588480534938,0.0,0.1718955794741961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06691842599441343,0.0,0.0,0.1093808731905698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05623367139507855,0.0,0.06618132343593824,0.0,0.07518470199565135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16399333308798844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20746487416827344,0.0,0.06926826116316158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07037875915646508,0.0,0.0,0.4727038709909479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677598941543202,0.0,0.07227905793768401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08817973095880624,0.0,0.0,0.0420177279517984,0.0,0.09141255330498754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08859506427917913,0.15926294108248756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07940111876676921,0.0,0.0,0.09064263022722546,0.0,0.10781175974561022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21445112487729864,0.08897619692142897,0.0,0.132595226674707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997282938006154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815363569166923,0.080795770366535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182404010051822,0.11926535548160393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07547159100259479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05449674479938445,0.061165358862713064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07677290798073268,0.0,0.07022231132479859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0770230576354215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4276991030334936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07940806649379968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06652678383290221,0.09039888568042737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386213794043747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06723727677181864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919707746371663,0.0,0.0,0.051531847595391936,0.07901524518844505,0.0,0.04689533129135267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2846136163069665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07752495706032297,0.0,0.1170978866838442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10357962389012013

alcoholism,theotherhigh,2020/02/09,"Need advice on how to get my dad checked out My dad has always been a heavy drinker. He’s currently 50. He’s always been a good dad, always held down a job, nothing to complain about in that aspect. Took custody of my 2 siblings and me when him and my mom divorced. That’s how good of a dad he is. 

Anyways, I’m worried most about his health. He had periods in the past where he’d drink every day of the week (when he got divorced). Half a 30 pack a day. He only drinks beer. I don’t know how much he drinks now, but it’s way less than he used to which is good. Probably 1 or 2 days a week and half a 30 pack. 

I just can’t see how his liver has maintained all that abuse for all those years and I really want him to have it checked out by a doctor. He’s a real stubborn and proud person and we don’t really ever talk about it. I’ve tried before. I think maybe he knows the outcome won’t be good so he tries to not think about it. I don’t know. It literally breaks my heart knowing it might just up and fail one day. Any advice on how to get him to go to the doctor?",-0.049871794871794606,1.7692092478632482,2.0295940170940163,97.87721153846157,84.72649572649573,4.925641025641027,17.869658119658123,5.985473137389443,-0.5043726495726495,820,19,201,6,24,274,126,234,0.069,0.846,0.085,0.1267,2,0,5,0,3,0,24.0,1,0,0,2,18,8,1,0,14,0,16,9,2,6,3,37,33,17,0,2,5,5,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,11,10,4,2,6,4,2,2,6,3,0,3,6,1,18,5,26,23,5,27,0,1,1,0,28,9,0,3,14,116,29,4,0.0,0.13297947656673526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21934842112070246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28016417264674504,0.0,0.0,0.07632327814408157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955032548226509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28952775443078416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22975344112963106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298411136521869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10152249017195668,0.09456236904496716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11727574095555653,0.0,0.06378542727119825,0.37654774400450775,0.08976414654739015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929997744004077,0.0,0.13299836966847867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113753786154643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24672448532970034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11275459547313332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11906302058572416,0.0,0.1314476373303069,0.0,0.0,0.08250523835244263,0.08322042633099043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10769198663803524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07605297141893813,0.08535936057354297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071404869759006,0.0,0.09799879709910683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12100772529067308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12774738114069056,0.14380053171516535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943632966216952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902098036350632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14383061398491773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12469660924521145,0.15239965548482698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09693453374609266,0.0,0.0,0.06619878950604415,0.08908648636589749,0.1800554199890986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11397953713313153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0722753093262613

alcoholism,That_Guy_U_Prob_know,2020/02/09,"I recently realized I may have a problem Long story short Im trying not to type out a novel.

I’ve been a pretty heavy drinker for several years now. I never thought of my habits as a problem until recently. I was talking with a girl whom I had dated for about 2 years and was trying to reconnect with. I vaguely remember her being extremely disappointed in me and saying she didn’t want to talk to me again. I vaguely remember because I was pretty hammered at the time. That really did it for me. I pushed away someone who loved and cared for me more than anyone ever has in my life, besides my father. 

That really was an enlightening moment for me. Im saddened by the fact that I can’t talk to her anymore, and even more saddened by the fact I can’t even remember specifically what she said the last time we talked. Despite that I’m thankful for what she did. If it weren’t for her breaking my heart I would have never realized the destructive path I was on. I looked back on the last few years and realized that days where I have not had booze were few and far in-between. 

So, I decided to make a change... for about a week and then I blacked out again. Which I’m honestly glad I did. It made me realize the benefits of sobriety even just a week of it far outweighs the destructive behavior I had. So, I need to stay on a good path. 

So here’s attempt number 2 at sobriety, and I’m feeling better than I have in a long time.",3.0809340329835098,4.581284037931034,4.789460269865066,83.1820014992504,74.13793103448276,8.49175412293853,28.125937031484256,9.085049710711278,2.3429670164917544,1121,45,228,25,23,380,141,290,0.065,0.78,0.155,0.9705,1,0,1,0,0,0,27.0,1,0,0,2,17,13,2,0,19,0,25,4,1,2,5,41,39,15,0,6,4,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,0,1,14,13,1,0,11,1,0,1,8,5,0,0,18,5,38,8,39,18,4,44,0,1,2,1,18,15,0,2,26,167,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10822856354418492,0.07630688744138166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10253210616432726,0.08391495305995011,0.0,0.06652520529358757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09651744391607413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11126626181993628,0.0,0.11544605939102065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038042514588662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21623986074902551,0.09871517891911913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055179879948054004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09153385091824533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12932068387543946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23576027435529595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17791255570034895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07708240704716075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19315488732979835,0.09164250039445597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09849492994057672,0.1032623297363136,0.07284574678466453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08091920579444507,0.16833701015436892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2220507891307402,0.0,0.2088471334161647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13982414332906248,0.0,0.21550726607583465,0.0,0.37087222795813396,0.0,0.10380851028327458,0.08678530001266152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12328689409856552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924662874079012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11631905678674576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3508612482223645,0.0,0.10047310309834898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08663777265141176,0.1909053780910735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1481854831664917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06436825317473695,0.0,0.17507650737758132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07752348537755241,0.0,0.0,0.21083023316780367
alcoholism,sizz_lor,2020/02/09,"Reservations about being an alcoholic/addict. So I use to be all about getting messed up with alcohol and pills mostly. I went to treatment, then I went to AA regularly for about a year. I got bored of AA and have since been drinking occasionally. As of right now I drink socially about once a week. I don’t do any illegal drugs and my mind is not hyper focused on getting messed up all the time. The problem I always had with AA is that you are either an alcoholic or you are not. There is no grey area with these people. I think I truly lay somewhere inbetween, which makes me not a true alcoholic. My problem with drugs was solved by a combination of relocating myself, treatment, and meetings. If you address the things wrong in your life that make you want to use, you will lose that urge to use.

alcoholism,Kamu_Loves_Kane,2020/02/09,"I was walking to the liquor store As an alcoholic without a car does,

And on the way I was contemplating the human condition and all the contradictions in the rules we set up for ourselves.

Like lying.
We all lie right?
If you say you don’t you’re lying alright.

But when we catch someone lying we all publicly ridicule them!

Like wow what a weirdo who would lie like that?

As I was thinking about that I reached the liquor store and someone was leaving the store as I was about to enter.

He easily could have held the door for me;

You know there’s like a rule about holding a door?

If you’re 10 feet away from me I won’t hold the door open, unless your old or hot.

I mean they’re the same thing right? Anyone else with me? Anyone else sucking old dudes dicks or am I alone on this? Nah I’m playing, unless you guys are cool with it. Then yeah I’m fucking old people.

Anyway the rude guy at the liquor store.

He should have held the door open for me, but he didn’t he just let it fall behind him without even attempting to be polite.

To add insult to injury I happened to address him right before he let go of the door,

I said good morning!
Yes morning I drink in the morning 
I’m an alcoholic.

He said nothing AND didn’t hold the door open!

Now when it comes to manners I’m kinda anal about it.

So I was fuming in the liquor store 
I bought 2 pints of vodka walked home and the whole walk I couldn’t stop thinking about the rude guy at the liquor store.

I realized something

What if the guy was deaf?
What if his mom died that day?
What if his kids died that day?
What if he was just diagnosed with brain cancer?

Hmmmmm

Nah I don’t care if all those things happened that day,
You still hold the door for people.

It’s common courtesy!

I’m 21 he was at least 50.

I thought our generation was supposed to be the rude unappreciative ones? That’s what I always here but honestly most the rude people I meet are older. 

I get it, I’m using anecdotal evidence to prove a point about differences in the generations, which in it of itself is asinine. But I’m drunk so fuck it. 

But I also get why older people might be more agitated than younger folk.

The older I get the more cynical I become, however I don’t appreciate older folks trying to flip the script on us like we’re the assholes.

Nice try boomers I see you! 👀",1.3815889830508468,3.650055879237293,2.7166,92.39958644067795,82.36864406779661,5.555661016949152,20.45694915254237,6.8313827282637405,0.2981985084745764,1813,52,389,21,50,585,221,472,0.17,0.736,0.094,-0.993,1,1,5,0,0,0,45.0,6,7,1,1,19,24,11,0,36,4,32,18,4,1,5,65,62,30,2,11,20,1,1,5,0,4,5,4,9,6,27,17,9,8,7,9,7,9,9,11,0,1,18,7,47,13,49,33,10,48,0,0,1,3,40,20,4,12,22,235,74,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18904070688184293,0.0,0.09160190667575237,0.0,0.07072909503159706,0.07359297191992765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12368500718405848,0.18124383888563186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08309659005075679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09768008484489743,0.07525981945543421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987333965772104,0.0,0.0,0.09017513919116403,0.0,0.0,0.07618717033051173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07061579669460005,0.0,0.0,0.17111830298031472,0.0,0.0,0.0897693823360028,0.18358301143470745,0.0924057568748281,0.0,0.0,0.07739844399199525,0.0,0.0,0.08664201273747366,0.0,0.0,0.14776818765347605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05841680794272733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16353116964949405,0.1386259207689975,0.0,0.0502650904331227,0.07418311366129758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3502961397193376,0.15642249195188876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08871712050420917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048606825640732564,0.0,0.0,0.09365003501084876,0.0,0.18088114139774086,0.0,0.21604776027905254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09634207107860372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09382571776993523,0.0,0.10358521781998986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848649555057185,0.0,0.27842311186097257,0.0,0.059932333287148434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24526532962008216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360871161151891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2265935525388504,0.16826208971000778,0.07033467630154956,0.0,0.0,0.07047887567424731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14987760352713972,0.06808895519085219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706319522012649,0.07394362536043428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11751729187014892,0.11334342542325405,0.0,0.07021511355074256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12009612214952665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10638793437056067,0.07638771602365721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020318723447612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07980747266809836,0.09874520994977894,0.0,0.1705148291596172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06282848879939984,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ScrewSquatcha,2020/02/09,"Can I quit without AA? I know I need to stop drinking. The amount I drink isn’t immediately dangerous to my body (usually 3-4 drinks 5 to 6 days a week). Occasionally I go on a bender and have more. Sometimes I take a break for a few days. But I do it alone. And in secret. And sometimes I turn into an asshole. I try going more than a few days, but it’s like picking up a crutch when walking on a healing foot gets too sore. 

I know my relationship with alcohol is unhealthy, toxic, and needs to end. I am an alcoholic because of the relationship with alcohol, not due to the volume of drink. 

Thing is I read the 12 steps. I disagree with quite a bit of it. I am an adamant atheist who thinks that God is a dangerous construct. I am very glad it works so well for so many people, but it isn’t something I want to be involved with. Also I am a major introvert with a very social and people oriented job. It leaves me exhausted and needing quiet, non-social time. 

Has anyone sobered up without AA? Are there any good resources to get help that don’t involve going somewhere a few nights a week?",2.189072398190042,4.109819977375569,4.096875565610862,85.37128619909505,77.73303167420815,6.772941176470589,26.88710407239819,7.734863291789972,1.6050939366515844,849,35,173,13,20,288,130,221,0.113,0.7809999999999999,0.106,0.1384,1,1,8,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,3,7,7,2,0,20,0,16,12,2,1,0,28,30,13,0,4,6,0,0,1,0,0,6,1,0,0,10,12,7,1,4,5,0,5,6,3,3,0,0,1,20,4,26,29,8,24,0,0,0,0,8,6,0,0,13,114,30,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3481589843345469,0.0,0.11246969790223196,0.0,0.08684185995451216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07384702936542796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759308179155442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06619734363850148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11855553589937246,0.12062244953509235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21010069047867366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.425519570579177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618125126846012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134708217045952,0.0,0.1851478776327092,0.09108273709265068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278766347020665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10776189198366648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11935985164917427,0.0,0.0,0.11498440947836415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05305310165005754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11009635538539672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2415612149991741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10190726466982876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15056955979041814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310042500118174,0.10862248323041084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331766913955845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11069698632492668,0.0,0.08360027098454344,0.2148026981084418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078869106427973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08164849391241888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07214442796321584,0.06958207137369524,0.0,0.0,0.063321507791228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372758421502515,0.11811810558654876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11959995376341953,0.17920135463204168,0.06405102180464595,0.0,0.17421366338901811,0.0,0.0976382351668636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2093597395446936,0.0,0.07905706751403886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,macabremac,2020/02/09,"My brother was murdered and now I'm one month sober On January 9th, the person I love the most was murdered. He was nineteen. We were really close, so he knew about my alcoholism. He saw me at my worst, absolutely wasted day after day. He was worried about the affects it was having on my mental and physical health. He always encouraged me to get sober. I wanted to get sober too, but as we all know, it's not easy. I've struggled with getting sober really heavily for the past eight months, and had made some progress. But, when he was murdered I knew I had to be done. I couldn't allow myself to cope with all this grief with alcohol. He wouldn't have wanted it, neither would the people who love me.
The night my brother was murdered, I broke down and went to the liquor store. I got drunk that night, but the next day I poured out any remaining alcohol and swore to get sober. I'm really proud to say I'm one month sober. Its been a real struggle, and I still get urges. But it's gotten easier to manage, and now I can honestly say I cant wait to continue to be sober.

alcoholism,turnleftturnright2,2020/02/09,"Pushing the boundaries Hey guys. I'm in a bit of trouble. I drink every day, and quite alot. When I don't drink withdrawals make me feel awful. Almost 3 years ago someone told me I have a problem. But kind of ignored it.

I have managed to hold onto my career but have lost a friend or 2 and suffered a few injuries along the way. 

Currently I'm suffering terrible anxiety with my best friend, whom I also really like aswell becoming more and more distant.

I've tried tapering off, but in my industry it's hard. I work in the ski industry, doing Northern and Southern winters, and drinking comes part of the lifestyle. Don't get me wrong I love my job but might not have one by this time next year.

Not only does it suck being hungover all the time, but financially crippling aswell.",3.5660222672064816,5.574941250000002,4.4963157894736865,83.65151821862351,74.0,7.3085020242914975,29.455465587044536,8.139509932561175,2.1828485829959514,618,27,115,10,13,200,104,152,0.17600000000000002,0.6679999999999999,0.157,0.3968,2,0,3,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,4,3,15,1,0,10,1,9,4,0,1,1,25,19,13,0,1,8,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,5,8,3,2,1,4,0,2,4,9,0,1,2,2,14,6,12,15,8,18,0,3,0,1,7,5,1,4,11,72,19,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13736125665111842,0.0,0.15516843662877644,0.0,0.0,0.12392016269758906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854273866145625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17113935928186966,0.0,0.0,0.16261926252014322,0.0,0.16917442009009795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13348292578334667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09993533748444422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356051249877234,0.0,0.0,0.4554006654578803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13055912076431406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07835161429516004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23944092423837554,0.0,0.08095935931374505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534331614414321,0.0,0.0,0.13881227401276808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15377228440536322,0.0,0.0,0.16136530999226315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07570483855977418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16915537976909126,0.0,0.13985599040805882,0.0,0.1034359237549631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16438635622404496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16479999801560566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10500381050360896,0.11785283277099708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1678048279304792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14827424470185216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16481731425543694,0.0,0.0,0.0992703079236786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13129573484229354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807149582437731,0.0,0.0,0.1480693753100466,0.0,0.10520657014959993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12299875150529195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11281154818500586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16942266575902667,0.0,0.19957623595742016

alcoholism,Icarus_818,2020/02/09,"I need some third-party advice. Hello,

I apologize if this isn’t an appropriate topic, I’m just seeking advice. 

I suddenly became disabled last year, lost my career and agency from it and have had to move back in with my parents while I receive medical treatment and fight to regain my life. 

My younger brother (32) has never moved out of my parents house and has been an alcoholic since he was 17. My parents have done all manner of things from therapy to inpatient to try and help him to no avail. Recently, he called our mother a cunt. This is totally unacceptable.

I went to confront him about it (and was naturally angry) and while verbally I should have handled it better, it ended up with him beating me until I was on the ground (and he kept kicking me in the face and chest even when I was trying to get away to save my life.) He was drunk, as per usual. The police came, saw how badly beaten I was, and filed felony domestic assault charges against him. This was 3 days after I’d had a seizure, fallen and sustained a traumatic brain injury, so he knew I was extraordinarily weak.

My parents are begging me not to press charges, and have already pressured me into writing letters to the prosecutor and calling them multiple times. My therapist says that he needs to face consequences, real ones, to finally make a change. 

I don’t know what to do.

Any advice? I love my brother, but he just does the bare minimum to get by in any situation and I don’t want to live in fear... his bedroom is a door from mine. Sober, he’d never hurt me, but he’s rarely sober and drunk, he’s capable of such evil words and deeds. I worry as my parents age, that he could be abusive to him and I just can’t tolerate the thought.",5.136113975576663,5.915969098507464,6.023263229308005,79.00021370420623,68.46268656716418,8.956580732700138,31.64518317503392,9.095868883498916,2.678044776119404,1348,55,257,24,22,445,195,335,0.154,0.797,0.049,-0.9838,5,0,1,0,1,0,46.0,1,0,1,4,10,15,6,2,13,0,30,12,4,2,4,50,46,28,0,6,7,8,1,0,0,1,5,1,2,0,11,22,3,1,4,2,0,6,8,12,0,1,19,3,41,3,40,23,3,34,0,2,1,1,38,10,1,2,18,173,52,2,0.0,0.11981279888445633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.296445161432511,0.0,0.10806845239892572,0.0,0.0,0.1115904221973428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13753258488561027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500726097079336,0.07775642326064243,0.08443248015687375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943401560162939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11288537314725147,0.20651333027822344,0.11565640143858233,0.0,0.0,0.10697345741668228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08073752991700836,0.0,0.0,0.06521519618795311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08849236969398189,0.10348271138587503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08956390133870784,0.0,0.0,0.06678999600230726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11379013990485655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11077399044012157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566393497632837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06777981180058139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166809817330698,0.10825297965509552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05557389738604408,0.0824277645399852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285063745495286,0.0,0.0,0.08929240311309458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11038639139639816,0.0,0.09126637365828442,0.0,0.06749958753691193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10186957617444901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21495294284475674,0.0,0.1499610685874497,0.15598273412180771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685227495583475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.561418966473186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150987481661834,0.0,0.0,0.0998455792781352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041611506074955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0836489989316898,0.1136651414068236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11564159254555967,0.11741020517666652,0.06718083143043756,0.0,0.0,0.08027941475257364,0.05896493549041103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13731013043580892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113713776615585,0.0,0.059644258334117836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09374092282539608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10269409770628776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06511912457614072
alcoholism,nocap003,2020/02/09,"help me I just had a really bad night. I blacked out. I don't know if something happened to me or not i don't know and it's destroying me rn. I keep asking my friends and they have nothing to tell me. I have two ideas in my head. One is embarrassing. The other is traumatic. There was just moments in the night where i was unaccounted for. I'm sore now. Something happened, but i dont know what and noone has answers and it's killing me. I'm writing this hungover. 

My friends drink and do drugs. I do the same. Will I have to leave them to get sober? How do I get away from this habit.

Also, have any of you blacked out and felt really shitty afterwards? Can you describe it for me cause I want to know if I'm feeling bad about blacking out or if I just went through something traumatic. How do i get through this? Do i just say, ""Oh I was rlly drunk,"" and suppress this moment in my life? Or do I have to face not knowing?",0.16580761432755153,2.395187310880832,1.867064654201396,96.62248929939176,87.8082901554404,5.014552827213336,22.89907636855148,6.498293943080001,0.43310380716377583,713,28,164,8,23,232,99,193,0.175,0.769,0.057,-0.9783,0,0,5,0,0,0,26.0,0,2,2,0,11,7,2,1,4,0,23,7,2,3,0,40,42,17,1,4,13,0,2,0,2,1,3,1,0,0,9,10,2,2,9,2,0,1,5,5,0,2,6,6,31,2,20,35,1,16,0,0,3,0,11,8,0,6,7,116,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143265744901547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972189898747623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13365007187897313,0.0,0.13431740485399474,0.0,0.23873441891023486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14686124517347834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16755027432388514,0.14004822935713518,0.16579040893064467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07228582882028255,0.0,0.13726583706934847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22090400839558225,0.0,0.2240750662790605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2528414603648497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.146720147121379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09582434362932504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613865762514365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12707109954378473,0.15816615346502885,0.0,0.39284058914246334,0.0,0.0,0.1513760030280376,0.0,0.0,0.10097821318407756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2683201048772041,0.0,0.13717579240754935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687467884130284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18317009930326444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11368903569086787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33017715004438664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12495499611997225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13965299666264605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843226287340579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325271074428351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,alcohol-sucks,2020/02/09,"Considering finally leaving for real Hoping to get some support, maybe some advice. Excuse my incoherence, this is the first time I'm trying to summarize my situation like this and I'm keeping the story intentionally vague.

I've been with my current partner for over a year. We moved together few months into the relationship. They had their flaws, but I believed that they genuinely wanted and tried to fix the worst ones and we even got engaged. I've never had a relationship with a stable person, so I thought this is just normal partnership issues. They have a child from previous relationship which I gradually started taking care of and got attached to. Even though I've always feared having a child of my own, I could finally imagine it I could do it and it would even be great with this partner. They had a rough life, are diagnosed with a mental disorder and are in the process of detaching from their toxic family (which is a source of stress). I've started therapy and due to having to deal with my partner, I think I've become a better person, more understanding and tolerant, less egotistical.

The biggest issue is that they're an alcoholic. They know it, and since that one drunk night when they called off the engagement, they realized it's really an issue and they've started specialized therapy. But they make mistakes. I've been multiple times seconds away from ending it, but we always made it through somehow. Every time they drank, I had some excuse for them or they managed to say or do something that gave me hope. But lately I've been feeling like they're just going in circles and repeating the same mistake again and again.

I'm away for the weekend to visit my family. I asked my partner beforehand if they needed me to stay with them, but they said it's okay. We were texting the first night, they said they were struggling, but managing. Second day around noon, they text me they had failed and they understand if I want to move out. It did hurt, but after chilling out, I wrote they're a dummy and one well handled failure is not such a big deal. We had a really nice discussion about how they feel and everything seemed fine. They said they're getting someone to babysit to be able to relax and focus on their wellbeing. I voiced my concern about them being alone. They said they're not planning to touch alcohol. Then in the evening, they stopped responding to my texts (but they did read them). I'm almost certain they're having a drink night.

So here I am, so deep into the night it's almost morning and I can't sleep, my heart keeps beating like I just ran a mile, and I'm thinking through getting an apartment, wondering where I'm gonna live and store my stuff in the meantime, dreading being asked what happened by people I know, and trying to convince myself I'm not gonna stay alone for the rest of my life.

My partner says they love me and want me, but it's not enough for them to genuinely want to quit. We talked about that yesterday and it seemed like they were decided and excited to find their own way, but I don't feel I can take any more. I'm so angry, thinking of telling them they can't ever get any better if keep making such basic mistakes, telling them they'll lose their child this way and many more hurtful things.",6.710461278586277,7.047852411858977,6.607169092169094,77.73062370062372,64.94551282051282,9.694663894663897,32.73024948024948,9.498858831193498,2.9188438669438668,2611,99,479,46,37,826,285,624,0.11699999999999999,0.755,0.129,0.0488,1,2,4,0,0,0,65.0,6,0,38,9,27,35,0,4,31,1,40,11,2,5,3,116,103,47,0,17,22,0,5,4,5,4,5,7,0,10,27,41,5,4,18,5,1,5,8,12,1,7,26,12,80,23,61,67,14,62,0,4,0,1,79,20,0,16,37,327,107,4,0.06322577235138592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061783492994183814,0.0,0.13513824491687051,0.12662295613203794,0.1309656645215297,0.0,0.0,0.10521781501474887,0.0,0.0,0.08599138660611856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05628434203489022,0.11821512459330533,0.0,0.118805388778564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06982789816545225,0.0,0.0712337943417167,0.0,0.11183611531381896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06456058263589642,0.0,0.0644628886890756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10096126898932344,0.0,0.0,0.04077539262900084,0.13036599011986258,0.0,0.06417282804460421,0.0,0.0,0.07246221273872046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06193718660143206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0559992678998568,0.0653291241532729,0.0,0.16704010536651906,0.057191330835608026,0.05327044011124398,0.0,0.056823247368089976,0.0,0.1192072624464932,0.07114657170634345,0.09590655066828044,0.04516850440093677,0.0,0.13852148631921218,0.057787210497723326,0.1075596193263762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321314260243195,0.0,0.03593266346578823,0.0,0.10113485186725392,0.06970663722398722,0.0,0.0,0.055910341684010816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07492284465661722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12559491596003625,0.0,0.0,0.13536899393737156,0.0,0.0,0.1979738392904697,0.0,0.16859391454401626,0.0,0.0,0.06949446197505565,0.0,0.07132142513316367,0.06694696383927423,0.0,0.0,0.08931646564002425,0.1235556748550698,0.0,0.055829515336120704,0.0,0.0,0.07073346673497068,0.0,0.0,0.05706372804608825,0.05982575453410175,0.08440738800143696,0.06410100948693324,0.0635187864483686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06371670766983452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05046620828182277,0.1343979801271105,0.0,0.04688110906770016,0.04876361338261722,0.0,0.0,0.2373324172819828,0.061947832801809835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128530258923446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0438327896812884,0.11041261137100852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724839150984968,0.06324288214331178,0.07196477081900693,0.08100809751345225,0.0,0.0,0.20364245376186133,0.0,0.0,0.24056875224940746,0.10055934374101247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511673710952293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052301012246170134,0.0710684171789747,0.06327143324803444,0.0,0.05357099173794298,0.048674288487856834,0.0,0.0,0.134254581274726,0.13478052173976687,0.0,0.052859576748437664,0.07242490861092621,0.06609730504860785,0.07237838270883225,0.0,0.07174785720505239,0.0,0.0,0.09507582452757528,0.05081848086635342,0.1105242236476678,0.0,0.14460836172901595,0.0,0.0420043937431999,0.12153756593392155,0.06211900032045661,0.050194200859695885,0.11060236891885733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12877844753368264,0.0,0.0,0.13164051758882833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491687946244937,0.10037135035013746,0.0,0.0,0.05684756245390394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06856565308419918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044913774642395037,0.0,0.0,0.04071532445591952

I have a good job that pays well and I never mix work with alcohol.

I’m not a violent drunk and the only issue I have is sometimes I can’t get it up to perform with my girlfriend or I’m hung over the next day and it keeps me from going to the gym.

I know what I’m doing is bad but in my head I keep telling myself it’s ok because it doesn’t interfere with anything. 

I need some motivation from this community to show me that I need to cut down my drinking. Some facts of personal stories or health facts.

alcoholism,enla_92,2020/02/10,Does it sound like I have a problem? Confused and worried Hi friends. I’ve never considered myself to be an alcoholic. I can go weeks without drinking. When I DO drink it’s usually in a party setting. I drink until I black out. This past weekend I blacked out in the middle of a nightclub. My sister found me trying to get inside the house. I was screaming crying and laughing. I finally fell asleep and wouldn’t wake up. I woke up in my own vomit and pee. Should I just quit alcohol all together? This isn’t the first time it happens.,1.3536211901306243,3.9235604433962266,3.063584905660377,87.62111030478957,86.07547169811322,5.525689404934689,26.078374455732945,7.010146845296331,1.4713419448476055,421,19,79,6,13,139,78,106,0.127,0.764,0.11,-0.1926,0,0,5,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,2,2,6,0,1,7,0,8,9,3,0,2,15,13,6,0,3,2,1,0,1,1,2,3,2,0,0,5,6,5,0,1,4,0,2,4,3,0,1,3,4,14,3,12,7,2,21,0,0,2,0,3,8,0,1,11,56,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3901066560993092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2004844649981454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15972035161653844,0.0,0.0,0.5363864707910062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19993656813855806,0.0,0.15524740406588275,0.0,0.20011858411542496,0.1410108527026709,0.0,0.09535670084306692,0.0,0.10372763978105004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16139765947927018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21059812833372696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891677466831367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14076703576929106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17423148694687313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1746424738858543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1941274666997662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10642612761013497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391589461080753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010147955313728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464027485921397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17593821700100798,0.0,0.0,0.18535312650472405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,jackieat_home,2020/02/10,What do I do? My husband is an alcoholic. He wasn't drinking when we met or married but he's had several relapses since we've been married. To be clear this is a great wonderful man when he's not drinking so imagine my shock when the cops have been called twice recently and I'm so beat up I can't go to work.  My son called the police tonight and I'm very honestly thankful he did so.  I didn't press charges but when do I give up? I don't think it's okay to live waiting on the other shoe to drop all the time. Why don't you guys come with a warning label?  I LOVE this man and can't resolve the difference between drunk  Chad and sober Chad. I don't know what to do.

alcoholism,astrologicalowl47,2020/02/10,"alcoholic step dad nailed my mom in a room hi everyone. i’m not sure if this is the correct sub but i really am looking for some advice on how to help my mother. my step dad is an alcoholic and has been abusive to my mom for many years. they broke up a few years ago when he pushed her down a flight of stairs. it was the first time he had ever gotten physical with her so she ended up getting back together with him because she wanted to see the best in him. sadly the best never came out and last month he was drunk and screaming at her so she locked herself in a room and tied it shut with a rope because he kept unlocking it. he nailed her into the bedroom and didn’t let her out for a while and when he finally did he said it was funny and he saw nothing wrong with it. she finally understand that she is not safe around him and is getting a divorce. she is so scared because her life is going to completely change and he has the money to fuck her over in court if she wants to. what can i do to help her :( i have no idea. she lives in a different state and i flew up this weekend to surprise her and she is so happy. she keeps telling me how much better is it that i’m here. but sadly i am in college and have a job so i can only stay for the weekend and i feel so damn awful. every day she has been breaking down so scared of what her future will be and i just want to help her somehow.

alcoholism,iCl00d,2020/02/10,"Alcohol Abuse I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist for depression issues. Only did I found out today that I wasn’t getting life insurance (I believe that’s what it was) and it list the diagnosis’s from the doctor’s notes. The thing that got to me was alcohol abuse in the diagnosis list. I ripped up the mail and threw it away so no one else can see it.

I never considered to have a problem. I have alcoholics in my family and I wasn’t like them with the drinking from when you wake up till bedtime. The rage and all of that.

However, looking back, it was going to grow into a bigger problem. I wouldn’t drink for relaxation or for the taste. I would drink to get drunk.

I haven’t been drinking due to paranoia of mixing with my medicines (thank you OCD for making me paranoid enough for that). I haven’t been counting days or anything. I know it’s been awhile. Probably a couple months or more.

I haven’t been craving it honestly. I’ve been honestly avoiding situations. Every weekend a group of people I hang around tend to drink. It’s really not fun hanging around drunk people while sober. Also, they will try to entice me to drink with them. So I haven’t been going.

I don’t understand why people get weirded out when you don’t drink.",2.5898497267759564,4.928864487704921,3.850409836065573,85.5650136612022,78.30327868852459,7.017486338797814,24.101092896174865,8.07648339933343,1.5133092896174858,981,34,190,18,24,320,126,244,0.158,0.7929999999999999,0.049,-0.9757,1,1,10,0,2,0,28.0,0,3,3,0,8,12,1,1,13,0,25,16,1,1,2,27,41,14,0,4,4,0,0,1,0,3,5,0,0,0,15,12,13,1,3,11,0,6,12,6,0,1,16,4,27,6,32,22,3,28,0,1,3,0,8,11,0,3,12,133,42,1,0.0,0.22962603441158785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106762850097577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749248948888422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07974208437083162,0.17252663792177933,0.0,0.0,0.09104261306034966,0.07451165188365631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10917536387446393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10722021311284216,0.0,0.06249376954483341,0.0,0.08346154532917917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09918329681598896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6644894411343061,0.0,0.0,0.08094918168692072,0.0,0.0,0.10012566320444743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816441091850133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09135057576494228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10624803465468316,0.0,0.0,0.15188187694582286,0.0,0.11014327244838842,0.0,0.07750137666421661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10114050567289956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05325480162541032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844474400348012,0.04734141949657976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08137326946082186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0646828333651829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07734624700885624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473679149171956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06566329889027832,0.07369833290994708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20153892435370369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10447673885119976,0.18544424246876934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062077898591103374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15443668634343802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10892190114535152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892143367629185,0.0,0.0,0.06437737893395486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918517597369307,0.0,0.0,0.06579009302445056,0.0,0.0,0.1008783930520354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08743897732756531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0688363961919058,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,jarlbronson,2020/02/11,"what am i in for greetings. i’m looking to quit drinking and im looking for some advice on the quitting process. i’m currently in my sophomore year in college and am 19 years old. i have never been a drinker. one time when i was on spring break during my junior year in high school, i got hammered for like 5 days in a row and couldn’t imagine how one could become dependent on this stuff. i felt so awful. fast forward to last year. it’s the very beginning of spring semester of my freshman year. i’m about a year into my substance abuse problem, smoking weed every night, prescribed adderall and taking that stuff every day. i had no idea at the time but i was suffering from depression, anxiety, and panic disorder for several years. i then first xanax, and man, i felt like a color blind person putting on those corrective glasses for the first time. then i woke up three months later. i had become dependent for several months and quit, with no recollection of what had happened. i managed to stay sober for a long time and was medicated with antidepressants (SSRI). then, in an effort to curb my consumption of weed, i started drinking beer every night. i’m studying pharmacology and what i can tell you is that the receptor action of alcohol has similar effects to that of xanax, which explains why i began to depend on it. i started in september and since then 2 a night turned into a six pack, and a six pack turned into 10 6 point 12 ouncers. i’ve recently started buying low point beer and have been trying to make sure i’m waiting until 4pm to start and wait at least an hour im between beers. these couple months are my only experience with alcoholism, and i’m wondering what quitting is going to be like for me and how i should go about doing it. i can’t stand the shakes, it’s making my depression harder to manage, and i’m trying to keep myself together so i can keep going to class. sleep schedule is also FUBAR.

alcoholism,hashtagvain,2020/02/11,"Does anyone have some advice on how to help my relapsing girlfriend? I don’t think I saw anything against this in the rules, but I’ll of course delete if I missed something. 

My girlfriend messaged me saying she’s been drinking. They’ve been sober since before we met and seems to be in quite a self hating place. They doesn’t want me to go to theirs, because of past trauma of people around them when they’re drunk, and has refused a phone call I think out of embarrassment but they are speaking to me via text. I’m worried, and trying my best, but obviously I don’t fully understand what she’s going though and could use some advice.",6.6400114285714285,6.438022784000001,6.100685714285718,83.12920000000003,65.16,8.422857142857143,29.857142857142854,7.447530270364453,1.670314285714286,508,15,100,4,7,156,87,125,0.18100000000000002,0.75,0.069,-0.9415,0,0,2,0,0,0,11.0,1,0,4,2,4,5,1,1,3,0,10,2,0,2,1,23,23,11,0,3,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,1,2,7,2,1,4,2,0,2,3,4,0,0,4,3,18,1,15,17,3,10,0,1,1,0,18,6,0,4,2,62,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3705658622823985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13257845671515608,0.0,0.15603138665549027,0.16879149048047498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558339418912975,0.0,0.16134260640361214,0.0,0.19898209999644392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1936111638765484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15138671304840193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1659274068900364,0.0,0.0,0.18574384392985135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21551741049274345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871988352600497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1270903745764422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810024742313201,0.13145044669147093,0.0,0.19810020498005265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2016716519192083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15078404488820474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1726121771479573,0.1978026966521116,0.0,0.0,0.15684585608544993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14596964990456965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2429865472548753,0.18628908631013769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12873151641059444,0.0,0.0,0.19738881514920828,0.0,0.16376060014034374,0.0,0.0,0.1118358244386878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1925563231524038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,gh0ul3,2020/02/11,"Any fellow Canadians, how can I get pharmaceutical help in a new province? So I just moved from the east coast to Quebec. Though my drinking problem has followed me. I’m tired of feeling like shit all the time and tired of drinking all the time so I don’t feel like shit. I’ve tried tapering off but then I end up just drinking more, or being good one day and then going on a bender the next. 
Because the problem is Im better at quitting things cold turkey, but I’ve gotten to the point where I have severe withdrawals. If I was back home I could go to the doctor and get some sort of meds to help with the first week of withdrawals, but since I’ve just moved I’m on a 3 month probation wait for my health card. I’ve already had to go back to my home town to get my adhd medication refilled but I can’t afford to wait/go back again just to get something to help. I’m not sure how the drug system works here. I mean I’m still a Canadian...shouldn’t I be able to go to a walk in doctor or SOMETHING to get some medical help? Obviously I’d have to pay, but I’m under the impression that I can’t get any help like that at all without my Quebec health card. I only have my NS one. 

TLDR: I live a new province, but with health insurance from my home province. Need pharmaceutical help for alcohol withdrawals. Need help within my new city.",2.26567575757576,4.045992287272732,3.6823863636363647,89.07024621212122,77.03636363636362,6.328787878787879,23.458333333333336,7.1686216300943375,0.7899242424242421,1049,33,223,12,24,345,135,275,0.076,0.773,0.15,0.9706,2,0,7,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,4,16,11,2,0,16,0,14,16,2,2,5,39,37,19,0,6,15,0,2,3,1,0,11,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,3,3,1,8,5,4,0,3,3,3,22,7,35,31,6,41,0,0,0,0,8,14,2,6,21,130,25,4,0.08191911873051858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09845086141668394,0.0,0.0,0.08754662472807535,0.0,0.0,0.09039978456705812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11141561972606157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18897223721502626,0.0,0.04993713443235374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245080343057192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06540575048696037,0.0,0.0,0.05283105458158016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16769537846192492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2407486482650668,0.09500017012849113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07255602431260659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08284153564852571,0.11704606957859268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0696803605437779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2567961506985456,0.0,0.23278261500692835,0.06870987016489583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2612285774995505,0.0,0.0,0.3843606095290805,0.0,0.2465146660901564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08848670562031202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12006463055164178,0.0,0.0723360826668767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08923393571011022,0.09099367356623536,0.16504978758521074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06538705901671912,0.1741341178085791,0.0,0.1214839770905902,0.0,0.23735398602082175,0.08712191212204606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1110210298705115,0.06230318121142645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07744004579951731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15677106641292873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08713106639354504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09254528681538493,0.16817759633501825,0.06776434154270004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261306796095739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06542071403743169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07720779993056567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054423422447558566,0.0,0.0804851182266508,0.0,0.09553539381573492,0.18830795238309356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055617704305842085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06571057576055296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0789671071656509,0.0,0.05963809408781275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's been hard to say i'm an alcoholic, but considering that last night was the first night in god knows how long i was sober i think i'm on the right path regardless. Depression had me stoned all day every day, and nights were a constant barrage of either 5+ beers, a bunch of whiskey, or tequila. It was getting to a point where my roommates thought i had the flu from how much i vomited every night/morning. Last night as i was about to have my usual tequila/seltzer, out of nowhere i decided to put it down. cracked open a fresh seltzer and drank just water all night. I didn't overheat for the first time in forever, i didn't vomit, i didn't wake up with a major headache or feel sore. I'm going to try and keep going with this sober thing, at least with the booze. Not sure where this puts me in terms of how to describe myself, but i thought you guys would be proud of me.",4.5446923076923085,4.661567943589748,4.72596153846154,90.12278846153849,69.56410256410257,8.14102564102564,29.07051282051281,7.793537801064563,1.481435897435897,739,25,168,8,12,231,113,195,0.091,0.846,0.063,-0.6217,0,0,6,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,4,8,5,0,0,11,0,15,12,1,4,4,33,29,12,0,2,8,0,2,0,0,1,5,1,0,1,7,8,7,1,6,4,0,4,6,1,0,3,15,3,18,4,27,12,8,37,0,1,0,0,3,14,0,2,19,103,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595242415281505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11724886371584207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399457458996564,0.0,0.093450021498948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10628770465472782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18283015797299246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054860349606990336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27686755757822473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0566862443851953,0.0,0.12332495327842752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10743105874338976,0.0,0.0,0.09719378407947124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09643888794923347,0.0,0.0,0.05962820766364245,0.1768823167861658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19203638458777167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07975924204269559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.712732668371384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10256661595863284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2181429060711484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926575450252986,0.0,0.08628275204520558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2045180289534035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07208190816137107,0.0695217720902017,0.0,0.17227215794241746,0.06326663386358887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07366369246224877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11949630937089975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707456983539371,0.0,0.0,0.0

I started because it helps me to socialize ad I have terrible social anxiety. I drink to work, be there for her school functions, everything. I have tried anti depressants and going to recovery groups but am too anxious to speak and feel like a weirdo without my liquid courage.
I am starting to feel like there is no hope for me and I need to get the strength to do this.
I hated my father who is an alcoholic and abused me because my mother who I hated left us for drugs. 
My father has kidney disease and liver and I don't want to get there but feel like I'm killing myself. My daughter doesn't deserve this shit but I just feel helpless. Sorry, not trying to be negative just honestly in my feels. 😞",3.8216110304789552,5.669316163522017,4.9133333333333375,81.62076923076926,72.89937106918241,7.911175616835995,29.84083212385099,8.617729084823388,2.4875946782776963,646,28,118,12,13,212,93,159,0.322,0.561,0.11699999999999999,-0.9911,0,0,5,0,1,1,13.0,1,0,0,2,6,15,4,0,4,0,12,8,3,0,0,26,30,11,1,4,7,5,5,3,0,0,3,1,0,0,5,8,4,1,6,2,0,1,6,8,0,0,0,6,23,7,16,28,0,8,0,3,0,0,15,2,1,1,8,80,28,2,0.0,0.14869143626218226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2682326688206964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920071567519347,0.14177399383683376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15300156783488836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10808893755847246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24587527937139256,0.14553473221345958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11278710406500632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3172710293690356,0.2689616508536615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13113225297320366,0.0,0.07132188393591514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2478012995948707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08411686948343497,0.0,0.0,0.12464517176094372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13884198089767275,0.0,0.06896894737420295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363510353168147,0.0,0.0,0.1839320269848729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861063832853361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12700796645621532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288191453437186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38378003250708026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404817393184277,0.17765247066748618,0.0,0.0,0.10491970909262427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17040617277906486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15095542138642673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0740203928049891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12097301277966778,0.0,0.09136208957364728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08081487329830249

alcoholism,jdubz524,2020/02/11,"Yep, so I’ve finally turned to Reddit for help. Long story short I got fucked by a company I worked at for 15 years. Hurt my back, they screwed me, lost my job but got a settlement. I’ve spent the past year?  Maybe more or less drinking, and I’ll admit, it got way out of hand. For the past month I’ve had friends and family trying to stop this shit. I’ve been puking blood weekly and if I go an hour or two without a shot I get sick. 

Look I know I’m fucked up, I just can’t see myself overcoming this, so I need to be locked up in treatment or does anyone have tips/tricks to get through this initial stage?

One person she replied to didn't answer her question fast enough so she replied to them again demanding they give her a response. Really ugly behavior from a mod in my favorite sub.

I was caught in her wake of anger when I made a comment that I think she should step away from her computer for a minute and she banned me from the sub.

I reached out to a few other mods there and I really hope that someone fixes this very harsh very rash decision.

alcoholism,Pasupureddit,2020/02/11,"When did you know you're an alcoholic? So, I'm originally from India and I arrived in the states literally 3 years ago and I started drinking (January 1st, 2017).  I'm at a point I could do 8 shots of whiskey in a row to get drunk. Frat parties are no joke and I used to drink at least 5 days a week. I don't know if it's nothing or if it's too much. I honestly don't know if I should stop drinking or not. I don't have the temptation, but when I drink, I drink till I pass out and I don't remember anything from the night. Please help! I do not have a problem taking a break, but I keep giving myself excuses that if I don't have a problem why stop?


I'm 26 now and since I started drinking when I was 23, I keep telling myself my ""drinking age"" is low and that's why I'm blacking out. People here in the states start drinking when they are 16-18 and everyone needs 5-6 years to know their limits and I'm just testing mine. I need a reality check. 

Weekdays when I go to work, I have the whiskey in front me and not for one second I think about it. But, on the weekends, I don't like what I'm doing or going through on Mondays. 

Not just alcohol, but in everything else, I'm a 0 or a 100 kind of person and this has always been a problem to me in everything else as well, Eg. I wouldn't present until I convince myself that I achieved the prefect 100 I literally could, which everyone hates! 

PLEASE HELP! WITH MY FATHER'S FINANCIAL HELP, I WAS ABLE TO GET A MASTER'S DEGREE IN 'IT' ABROAD AND NOW IS MY CHANCE TO CLEAR THE HUGE EDUCATION LOAN MY DAD TOOK FOR ME.

alcoholism,blazdncnfsd,2020/02/12,"Does anyone else feel like the way they feel when buzzed (not shitfaced) is the way they were supposed to feel naturally? Sometimes when I drink I notice this side of me comes out that is basically the ideal version of myself that I aspire to be without alcohol. When I *don’t* go overboard and when I’m able to maintain that healthy balance while slightly buzzed I sincerely think that “this is the way I was meant to be”. I’m extremely anxious and neurotic normally, but when I’m slightly buzzed I’m as cool as a cucumber, I have the perfect responses to everything, I’m entertaining, not afraid of being judged by others, and overall more out of my shell. I want to be that way without alcohol. I can’t tell you how many times I thought I had it under control and ended up embarrassing myself, hurting myself, blacking out, agreeing to do things I would never agree to do sober, etc. and it ruins the whole experience for me. Does anyone else feel this way?

alcoholism,00squirrel,2020/02/12,"Typical click-bait over at r/stopdrinking And the predictable circle-jerking in the comment section of these posts. These karma whore posts are upvoted to the Moon while real people needing support are largely ignored or banned by sanctimonious mods like u/sfgirlmary.

Strongly considering unsubscribing from that sub. It’s no longer a supportive community; it’s now just a giant circle-jerk.

alcoholism,CharmingFlea,2020/02/12,"Giving up on an alcoholic parent as an alcoholic myself On mobile. Came to the conclusion recently that some people are just beyond help. Almost as young as I could remember, my parent was an abusive alcoholic which made me give up half my childhood and early adulthood to raise my younger siblings. It became one of the main reasons that drove me to alcoholism to begin with as i balanced that ontop of my own life issues. It then went on to become my addiction for over an decade. I took responsibility for my past decisions though and they're constant reminders of why to stay sober which was going well until she returned into my life. I've finally got myself under control the last couple years and without support which sucked. My parent however has not learned a single thing or has taken responsibility for anything in her life even now in her fifties. Not even a month out of rehab recently(one of the best here and post graduation professional help offered) and shes as bad as ever and has tried dragging me down along several times already which she succeeded in twice. It's gotten to the point where our family gatherings are done in secret cause no one wants to deal with her causing a drunk scene which also means we can't invite the one sibling who still supports her either cause of the same drama. Chances are she'll be around at my siblings for a few more months and I really want a drink more each night just thinking about it.",7.98,8.034812555555561,7.687777777777778,72.00500000000002,62.33333333333333,10.311111111111114,34.2962962962963,9.888512548439397,3.3673407407407403,1170,44,197,21,15,372,173,270,0.057,0.853,0.09,0.8059,4,0,5,0,0,0,14.0,2,0,0,4,15,7,1,0,16,0,14,11,0,6,1,43,33,18,0,3,7,3,0,0,0,1,9,0,0,0,14,16,6,1,8,3,0,5,5,2,1,5,11,0,28,5,47,19,11,46,0,0,0,0,22,19,1,3,20,157,42,4,0.0,0.1136676555353192,0.0,0.1045836490754964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41010268471775935,0.09606535568186357,0.0,0.10586700076675998,0.07671943318072064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07894658635862972,0.08540276585018583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08010197708276122,0.0,0.10595301324013018,0.0,0.0,0.1006781896765128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10972443780278712,0.0,0.295655971575385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10367198905346507,0.1075996083189455,0.07659653914127555,0.1061505963970001,0.0,0.0,0.0989050926644272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817513071382307,0.0,0.09398008137791472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12672873565230636,0.08677898078627637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09043927275589912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10509244341886416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18405978318601893,0.05452224781165508,0.0,0.07672823169859734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12860683285476204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10013153943066123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07820008240783156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2032858409420341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09077631045450224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10450167758127303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15314929919825707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09002879010838961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1950247477477548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3195744275381315,0.0,0.09158110921989784,0.0665094649483685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906898774958245,0.0,0.09187950853092987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06145861649783323,0.0986374772415562,0.09472454543905863,0.0,0.10867600537404637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837959401304376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10225427643954547,0.07661406292428903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2177325070385398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0637351574849321,0.061471473297860624,0.09425595551826764,0.0,0.055940651068922494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658765993107096,0.06513377849948596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11317026351283475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08625736554573267,0.08893299400805843,0.08656669598200158,0.0,0.0,0.09247821590385942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061779194626948815
alcoholism,doodlezook,2020/02/12,"Halp! Have been having anxiety and panic attacks for months. I have a heart condition, so have ended up in the ER three times in the last six months mistaking panic and anxiety for heart. 

Today, though, I realized all of this anxiety is actually alcohol withdrawal. I’ve been drinking heavily every night for years. At least four. Maybe more. 3-6 beers a night, and a couple glasses of whiskey on top of that. 

Today was fucking rough. Anxiety. Shakes. Racing heart. Sweats. And the realization of what was happening fucking crumpled me. 

I’m a wreck. I’m scared of what tomorrow will be like. 

I’m 45 years old. Tough bastard. Been through so much, and survived. But- I feel so vulnerable. So scared. 

I called my therapist in the midst of all this today, asking if it was possible to get an earlier appointment, but didn’t hear back. 

I’m so anxious. I feel like shit. So I’m up. Drinking. Cuz that’s how I do it. 

How the fuck do we get here? 

Embarrassed. Ashamed. Afraid. 

Thanks. I just needed to dump it all. I just don’t know who to talk to. Who to burden with this.",0.36256742179072177,2.6621792427184485,2.2222491909385127,89.32209007551243,101.23300970873787,6.172384034519958,21.741639697950372,7.3871296695380915,1.4506875943905064,828,33,163,20,36,272,122,206,0.235,0.7040000000000001,0.061,-0.9871,0,0,5,0,0,0,44.0,1,0,0,2,13,21,7,8,10,0,17,13,5,3,3,24,35,18,0,3,5,0,3,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,12,7,5,0,4,4,0,1,2,18,1,3,7,4,11,3,23,26,6,24,0,0,0,3,7,8,5,1,17,104,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.10583004402722587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11589841254152942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3318510718623518,0.1225158806912172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138466195998963,0.12337576882253558,0.0,0.08339016448157535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11073799345047616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11999614800099008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2124763899016219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960531381338222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09137249707630384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10966959039241676,0.07747559486456125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3007765355312947,0.11331967891463565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09590060681663344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1222292857566041,0.3855358087922088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059600432344605214,0.08839996176003555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10596487015950784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1089510452123876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17312503741487525,0.0,0.07972208951907117,0.08041315206476303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20354304900545425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11379840603935293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25448178079558464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12225933350949812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21715163631509954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132077621964567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08716675673574882,0.0,0.09984476291561402,0.0,0.12591700995142766,0.0,0.0,0.10655005221114726,0.0,0.06323716373512407,0.0,0.3083893522188118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13967449328521764

alcoholism,Leon_Depisa,2020/02/12,"I’m going into treatment This isn’t for karma. 

I’m an alcoholic. I drink 6 IPAs a day, most days, at least. I can’t relate anymore to the idea of someone not drinking every day. 

I don’t drive drunk often; I keep most of my drinking to at home, but I talked myself out of a DUI once and puked in the same bar that got me that drunk in the past week. 

I can’t stop drinking, and after going on to SSRIs and a strong anti-anxiety antihistamines, I almost immediately started getting into trouble with them. 

I thought I was high-functioning. I thought I was managing. I thought every alcoholic I knew was a worse kind.

alcoholism,GlittahBunni,2020/02/13,"102 days sober but now struggling with food addiction Just turned 30 and decided back in August that I wanted to begin a sober lifestyle. I was sober until Halloween, when I had a triggering experience and was surrounded by friends who couldn’t relate to my sober choice so I succumbed to peer pressure and had a shot. I then had a drink the following night and then the night after that, so on November 3rd, I took responsibility and decided that this time around, it would be for good. 
Sobriety has been the hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life. I have really bad social anxiety so I used drinking to cope with that since I was 18. Learning who I am without my vices has been extremely jarring for me, it’s like I’m completely rewiring my brain completely and I’ve lost some friends along the way.... 
Unfortunately, I have replaced my alcohol addiction with food. I have a crippling sweet tooth &amp; cant seem to find motivation to hit the gym anymore. 

I could really use some advice, anything to help me overcome this struggle. it feels like I’m being overwhelmed and I just needed to get that off my chest. Thank you in advance .",4.831413398692806,6.723826569444448,5.3717755991285445,79.18019607843138,70.3425925925926,8.786056644880174,30.76143790849673,9.325443323948027,2.8698401960784317,913,39,166,20,17,293,132,216,0.10400000000000001,0.7490000000000001,0.147,0.8699,1,0,3,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,0,3,10,13,0,4,10,0,22,11,3,4,1,34,38,15,0,5,4,0,1,2,2,1,4,0,0,0,13,12,5,0,7,3,0,3,3,6,0,0,11,2,24,7,24,21,2,25,0,2,0,0,7,7,0,3,16,114,37,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2775749407538048,0.0,0.12440655659545567,0.0,0.136056435948384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13794110577673932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09739234799066822,0.0,0.1262580191968105,0.0,0.0,0.10476587031015187,0.11333352718436825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978940808912907,0.10629912868578373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1421208613631551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26696572355532777,0.0,0.0,0.10164724601805608,0.0,0.0,0.08210487858430499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13028306208609475,0.0,0.2494320646784969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151598297791174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453430761652183,0.0,0.0,0.06437212241955724,0.09095079974866777,0.0,0.0,0.1163596864611604,0.0,0.30788924220490416,0.0,0.19671988415274752,0.0,0.06651459367666462,0.0,0.0,0.1067821869563634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533368821455424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992332254990643,0.12439516860914593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1389746837047015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09439928152067437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23894496225154174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16311700714212146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158988928616276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10531273847879244,0.0,0.0,0.12977724063375887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26618560145541864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11721060101269408,0.0,0.0,0.08457958160382957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423590132610665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14144688797909633,0.0,0.1384774989891255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2199111622855299,0.0,0.0,0.07509115781328096,0.10105331920187953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12272298551182252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09043787873066134,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,alcthrowaway20,2020/02/13,"Too young to have a possible problem Hi, I am 20 years old, in college in the US. I've struggled with drug abuse in high school, never was an addict but I just liked pills a lot, I was taking them all the time. I snapped out of it around senior year and went completely sober for half a year, never picked them back up, but drank or smoked weed occasionally with friends. I got a job working in a winery two years ago and I would have my coworker give me wine all the time since they could often take some home, and around the same time was cheated on and sorta fell into my old habits just with drinking instead of pills. Stopped that after some friends told me they were concerned and went sober for a bit again. Over the past 6 or 7 months, I've consistently been what my friends call a ""dad drinker"". probably three to four nights a week I have a beer or two, that's it. Some weekends I will actually get drunk, but i just have a beer or two a few nights a week. Obviously I am not 21 and technically shouldn't be drinking at all, but I like the taste and I get really worked up and a beer at the end of some days helps. I find that I am craving it at night more than I used to and I am worried that when I'm 21 in a few months it might get worse, but that could just be my anxiety. It doesn't affect any aspect of my life, I do well in school, my relationships are great, I just feel like I shouldn't want it(alcohol), you know? I can't imagine ever being in the places I used to be with substances again, but I just feel so guilty for my small habit, especially since about half of my friend group at college are straightedge punk people abstain from substances, although they don't mind at all if anyone uses (responsibly) of course. I really hope this is the right place for this, I just feel so guilty even though I feel like my consumption is pretty normal for most people who drink. Does anyone have any advice to offer? Does it seem like there is more of an issue than I think there is?",5.184611111111111,5.137745118518517,5.296929012345681,87.14243055555555,68.18518518518519,8.429012345679013,26.75154320987655,7.937092434478242,1.254154320987654,1563,40,345,17,24,491,206,405,0.085,0.787,0.127,0.9702,1,0,12,0,1,0,41.0,1,1,5,2,25,15,1,1,25,0,35,15,0,5,8,80,59,25,0,10,19,1,4,5,4,5,5,0,1,0,15,17,10,2,9,9,0,3,8,3,1,7,10,5,44,12,46,38,16,60,0,0,0,0,21,25,0,16,37,233,59,8,0.0,0.09407693016828224,0.07748369899758634,0.08655856060796847,0.0,0.07758951467198542,0.07038399290524812,0.08485527710217802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799049437635228,0.0,0.060741372642710775,0.0,0.0,0.11103773077349004,0.0,0.0,0.14136704062783467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06105429193988944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08668507753691965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08107706493919617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325019794603791,0.0,0.0,0.1267901098160121,0.0,0.0,0.05120692876561149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13896829990850984,0.0,0.0,0.23334758277614914,0.09207968652184942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07032551589055361,0.0,0.0,0.0524434605346998,0.07182254333528075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605896625908709,0.11344785362841295,0.0,0.0,0.07257086641553756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24537935548484455,0.0,0.12445087742662996,0.07616845481694598,0.0,0.0,0.06350405013149771,0.08753963056336861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05322066324259663,0.08389127418341351,0.07964544746224764,0.07886288151048187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08287377617051214,0.07879301368143649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043636587344963736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056083112862192204,0.19395603061559188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750369628043579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423167064916748,0.08017214430198596,0.0,0.12675387609731206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12247753931186052,0.0,0.0,0.22353673506172209,0.077795897401369,0.0,0.0,0.16663550546553554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0757970205001463,0.11009299452883113,0.0,0.16591381263403765,0.0,0.0,0.08951243934906064,0.0,0.08077912940847147,0.08560746075940749,0.07597581473524773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017323344143285,0.0,0.0,0.08524671336556129,0.0,0.06780782477102157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16071563892958174,0.0,0.07228348002104094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313622768921764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06638260005895001,0.0,0.08300692581965928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11939899679721673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050876808125837815,0.07801085456963175,0.0,0.1388976846419784,0.0,0.0,0.07587083953211625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2326890482533173,0.0,0.09550935140106946,0.20573031863792168,0.0,0.0,0.04683263206002728,0.0,0.1273810185606676,0.0,0.0713908289629887,0.1472106207795004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11560941419239495,0.0806353373643002,0.0809161692560247,0.056404029744941964,0.0,0.0,0.20452597359910385
alcoholism,Kinasin,2020/02/13,"My aunt just died of alcoholism  

Found her with my mom and grandmother laying dead and bloated in her house. She suffered with alcoholism and already almost died once before but we nursed her back to health. She had jaundice and swelling of the liver and light cirrhosis. She was only 50 and she messaged my other aunt telling her that her stomach was hurting. The thing is she wouldn’t let anyone into her house and when alcoholics are that far gone they often times don’t think clearly so she didn’t call 911 or get to a hospital. We went to her house as soon as we found out she was saying that her stomach hurt and I looked through her front window because she keeps her doors locked and I seen her with her eyes partially opened with her stomach bloated. I got a bad feeling and called 911 and the fire department came and said she had passed away.

alcoholism,zeus1820,2020/02/13,"Dull ache in the upper right abdomen  

Hello Reddit!

Last night I drank a bit much in a party and when I woke up this morning, I had a dull ache in my upper right abdomen. I'm really scared it's liver damage, I had hepatitis around 8 years back so I'm worried my liver was weak to being with. There are no other symptoms at the moment. I'm not running any fever currently. I'm a 22 year old male.

Should I be concerned? if I must visit the doctor what do I tell them, what kind of tests should I look forward to? or how long should I wait before I visit the doctor?",1.3150572956455306,3.1060418655462168,3.4038808250572963,89.9268143621085,79.92436974789916,5.335676088617267,19.22154316271964,6.1124844417494595,-0.016536134453781326,438,10,92,3,11,149,81,119,0.217,0.76,0.023,-0.9670000000000001,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,0,6,6,0,1,8,0,11,10,4,1,1,12,19,6,0,5,3,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,0,1,5,3,1,1,0,0,0,4,2,5,0,0,5,1,13,1,10,8,2,24,0,3,1,0,6,11,0,2,11,58,18,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14312097435715435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873552733829659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16183183161788744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17908715685264776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22976934832935025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4308323378656103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2191631695863934,0.0,0.17155413729563498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862517230999124,0.1767345765215709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15471335075885376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19750377420660892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22084384410362348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13482696703159933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35946578469939594,0.0,0.0,0.21070858453252228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21874998697461773,0.0,0.0,0.1839525469100498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21373377569653312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710604927951819
alcoholism,JimmyFett,2020/02/13,"I just need to vocalize my problem I come from a long line of alcoholics and am a functional alcoholic myself. On top of drinking 3-5 oz of scotch every day for six years I was diagnosed with epilepsy two years ago. I'm now afraid to quit drinking because because my first seizure was preceded by a four day period of sobriety. I continued having seizures until I started drinking again. I work in the hospital setting and have seen some pretty nasty detox. In fact, my hospital is the county's most popular inpatient detox destination. 

I want to quit drinking but am demoralized by the rate of relapse and being seen in that condition by my coworkers. My wife and children deserve better than a workaholic, alcoholic husband/dad.

alcoholism,myfightagaintalcohol,2020/02/13,"Withdrawals is hell, but I'm finally getting help 43 years old, and been drinking everyday since I was 20. Past few years I've been cutting down just drink two 42oz of 8%.Over time I do drinking binges for like 3 days then next I go through painful detox for 3 days. I've done them by myself. Then today came from binge drink a day that has changed my life. Instead of doing this by myself, I've gone for help. Went to the ER tonight. This detox is different, so I was worried I was going die. Got me to the ER, and they did an amazing job. I feel so much better now. This is the end of the road for me if I don't quit drinking. So, I'm going to treatment outpatient care, and also AA meetings. Just going to keep cleaning this up - including my room. Get healthy. Speaking of the liver it came with issues. Wish me luck everyone.",1.8272855029585773,3.8388848461538494,2.8429844674556186,93.49276072485209,79.23668639053255,5.645118343195268,25.355399408284025,6.6274283507984215,0.8071446745562132,645,25,139,6,16,205,110,169,0.08900000000000001,0.726,0.185,0.965,2,0,5,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,2,2,8,8,2,0,7,0,14,10,1,0,0,14,31,11,1,2,4,0,1,1,0,0,4,1,2,0,6,6,5,1,1,5,0,8,1,3,3,1,12,2,16,5,19,19,2,29,1,0,0,0,6,4,1,2,18,80,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09633462728606962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10654018729022044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2755563325137105,0.12282057929016997,0.0,0.1274344231508275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2330669992606172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12502210706015776,0.12585873103065953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12327599714923332,0.0,0.5900419057143813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10669491645743467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151080483793782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060909971356364084,0.0,0.0,0.13196188954486154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12587442648605168,0.0,0.2738487605538996,0.0,0.09634567535961737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16148830610258924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12573260946689555,0.11954144816020623,0.10707350472077448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08508694128624575,0.05885238727619752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855454227012204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281143119890954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12640619204384593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12818167042563372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499605324718094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12812777350717147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996486622329336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07024324278009611,0.0,0.11418532425772815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11767534751106605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11167088279992032,0.0,0.0,0.13852709412106087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12233654420666268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15514910477509256

I have ruined a relationship over things that I said while drunk, and have experienced more hangovers than I would like to think about. The thing is I get extremely excited to drink copious amounts and I like to get drunk not just feel a buzz.

I am tired. I have been drunk every day for probably 2 years. The trauma of everything I have lived through for the last four years has been so, so much. We have been through 2 counties, 3 courthouses, and countless hours of proving that HE is a loser (we got there!) He has ZERO rights and, in fact, is in county jail.   
Turns out, I turned myself to alcohol. Turns out, the preemptive alcoholic marker coupled with trauma, can trigger some shit.

alcoholism,putmeinthepicture,2020/02/13,"They said it couldn't be done... A while ago, I made a post saying my mom was a binge drinking alcoholic.

She was 125 pounds and drinking 14-16 beers a day, give or take, after getting off of hard alcohol.

Everybody said to take her to a hospital and get her help, rehabilitation, rather than help her taper off. 

Now, I'm not shitting on anyone for saying this AT ALL. *Rehabilitation and/or inpatient therapy is, and always will be, the best course of action for alcoholics to take.* 

However, in my case, I knew that wouldn't be possible, so I hated hearing that answer as it didn't work for me. And for awhile after that post, things continued on and didn't improve, until this past 30 days

In the past month, while it was rocky at first, my mother has gone down from 20 beers (at most) a day (for almost 10 years now), down to *only three.* She plans on fully stopping in two weeks.

I am beyond proud of her for doing this in the way she did. She jumped from her usual 16 down to 6 in one day, and stayed at that until her shakes went away, then jumped to 5, 4, and now we're here, at three.

She is doing amazing. She said she feels much better, she's drinking almost a gallon of water a day, eating three times a day, whereas before she would eat once every three days and only drank beer.

alcoholism,Zoe0176,2020/02/13,"Should I quit cold turkey or taper? Hi there. I’m a 19 year old female and this is my first time reaching out here. I’ve admitted to myself that I’m an alcoholic. I started binge drinking last year during my first year of college. I was miserable being so far away from home, and had no friends. Also was in an emotionally abusive relationship at the time so not to place blame, but I’m sure that didn’t help. Fast forward a year later and my drinking has just gotten worse and worse. I’m putting away a 1.75 L of vodka every WEEK, drinking by myself and often getting pretty shit faced. Sometimes when it’s bad it’s every 5-6 days. Because I drink so much, I’m worried about the effect it will have on my body if I go cold turkey. I am also a small female, 5’4 and 120 lbs and I fear that doing that might actually kill me. Someone please help. I’ve never tried to do this before and I do not want to check myself in. I haven’t even told my family and don’t plan to. It would shatter them. So how can I go from drinking this much to eventually not drinking at all? I have probably about 4-5 mixed drinks a night. Should I start off with 2 or 3 a night for a week or something? I don’t know where to start but I know cold turkey isn’t probably the best idea. What do you guys think? 

(I’m so happy by the way to have found this community. To not just read stuff on the internet from a hospital website, but to hear about real life people and their experiences. It makes me feel so much less alone, so thank you.)",1.1762499999999996,3.280187146496818,3.0056648089172,90.99059912420384,81.99363057324841,5.70843949044586,20.322054140127392,6.9077264865688965,0.3359047770700636,1180,33,255,14,32,393,173,314,0.13,0.75,0.12,-0.6482,0,1,10,0,0,1,36.0,0,2,2,6,21,10,2,2,15,0,25,12,3,3,3,45,49,28,1,5,13,0,1,0,1,5,2,1,1,1,15,12,8,0,8,9,1,4,11,5,0,2,7,5,28,5,32,36,6,41,0,1,0,0,13,15,1,6,23,164,43,2,0.0,0.09905489981392107,0.08158365741408496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08934529386751383,0.0,0.08658663423095518,0.0,0.13371324906293636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15709398002015793,0.0,0.06980431924510384,0.05096310639751462,0.0,0.07113928842706464,0.0,0.0877353187666933,0.0,0.0,0.09286316325856887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05391648292076552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5732880871947463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404118784343972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05521844430794808,0.0,0.14087686662258034,0.0,0.0,0.08177896350898545,0.0788126847509041,0.09407568317436167,0.042271768728623885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422239248838033,0.0,0.09166546341414808,0.06459082856572235,0.0,0.04367868287226338,0.0,0.0950260787763877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08277929145557475,0.0,0.08899606372517406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942257207468392,0.0,0.11207354355835908,0.0,0.08385979224551376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943766729737067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09249341356509053,0.0,0.0918911316503414,0.06814692615826175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059050684539558175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05580509714490297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08868869001558352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843716413267018,0.0,0.06447914682319318,0.0,0.0,0.1569099449189237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08772641321206552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05795921765177135,0.0,0.08734647303442275,0.09177007655823782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08505346163293083,0.18027455686912366,0.0,0.0,0.08404327115384011,0.0,0.08892119777434032,0.08362479316789377,0.09515757143194598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08975744251844886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08581642532282384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083584669232527,0.06436103430845745,0.08268468307395016,0.0,0.17752213704461056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09570448212871097,0.0,0.0,0.07879405511162367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696964512461531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05356889433724354,0.0,0.0,0.09749819438188123,0.0,0.0,0.07988545539494704,0.0,0.056760385119089374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049310725471485004,0.06635951057695512,0.13412123470814713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490206100257497,0.1703955055643193,0.05938858236012385,0.0,0.0,0.2153482239265739

alcoholism,ethicalharvest,2020/02/14,"How to become a better ally TL,DR: I have my alcoholic friend's attention and interest in social skills learning from me, how can I best meet him on his level and help him out of his addiction?  


Hello folks,

I joined this subreddit with the distinct aim of trying to understand my good friend better. I'll call him  Miles for now. 

I've known Miles for about 24 months. He was introduced to me by a mutual friend at a house party we were hosting. He was wildly drunk and out of control. We had a good laugh at his expense (not proud of this but that's the truth.) Whenever I'd hang out with my mutual friend, he'd bring Miles along. I didn't pay much attention to him to be fair, though did enjoy his company when he wasn't too disruptive.

Fast forward to 14 months ago. Our mutual friend's leukemia came back, he didn't last long. About  3 weeks in hospital till he died. A big shock for all of us and our community. I made it a resolution of mine to get to know Miles better. Our friend brought us together for a reason and I intend to honour it. 

I started playing DnD about 2 years ago. I started a campaign with Miles, his girlfriend and another friend. All 4 of us knew our friend who passed on and in a way this was our chance to become closer, honour our friend's memory and stay connected. It worked! After a year of playing, these 3 people have become really close friends of mine. They all have a place in my heart now, next to the love for our friend who has passed on. 

During our DnD sessions, Miles has been drinking (sometimes very drunk), caused problems and made other invited players uncomfortable. I tolerated it for a while, not really knowing how to navigate this behaviour. Now I am quite firm, if he gets too drunk and wants to continue drinking, we stop playing. I am very open with this to Miles. He loves DnD, it quickly became one of his favourite hobbies (and he doesn't have many.) Again, I'm not certain if this is the 'right' attitude to have. Once or twice, Miles has stayed and I've helped sober him up and continue playing. Other times we just finish early and go our own ways for the evening, normally we're all disgruntled and would have loved to continue playing though it's a line I'm not willing to cross anymore. 

I have a small side business growing herbs and teaching about their medicinal uses. Miles has come over to help me quite a few times and I've even paid him in cash/herbs for the work before. He's expressed an interested in learning some of my social skills (his main draw to drinking is because of social anxiety.) I can hold myself quite well in many awkward situations and have quite a calming presence when needed. 

He gave up drinking recently just before Christmas. He's expressed an interest in giving up multiple times. Tried AA, anti-psychotics etc. We asked him as friends if there was anything we could do to support him during the upcoming NY party to remain sober but he asked for 'no special treatment.' His sobriety lasted 3 weeks, with him drinking at NYs and not stopping afterwards. I've been away for 6 weeks now visiting family and he hasn't stopped since. 

When I come back (at the end of Feb) I want to try again and meet him on his level to help him quit drinking. A big motivation for him quitting in December was not to upset 'his new friends.' I was touched to be considered one of those people.

My questions to all of you out there:

\- How to navigate it when Miles doesn't want to talk about/draw attention to his addiction. How can I create space to discuss this with him? When he gave up recently, I asked him how many days he'd been sober. For me (having my own journey with addictions to video games), days of sobriety are something to celebrate and cheer about every damn day. Mile's response to my question was 'I don't want to think about it'. Knowing that counting the days can be a great tool for overcoming addictions, I'm at a bit of a loss when it comes to someone not wanting to engage in this positive behaviour. Can I celebrate this with him without the shame or guilt that could come with it?

\- What was it that gave you the most support from your closest friends? I'm going to propose something to Miles when I come back: A regular time slot to come and help me work with my herbs. During this time I'd like to introduce him to meditation, maybe go running together, get lunch together. This is all something I'm willing to pay him for his time with me. 

\- I'm scared for Miles. He's drunk himself to the point of having seizures. I've said to his face I'm worried about him dying soon, that I can hear his clock ticking faster than those around me. Was this too direct? Too harsh?

I love this guy. He is a damn good role player too. Any advice would be appreciated. If you feel I've been on my high horse or too righteous in some of the things I've written - please let me know. 

I have a lot to share about navigating anxiety by using herbal remedies. If there's interest, let me know and I'll share with you all one day.

Peace and love to you all and your journeys

alcoholism,I_Want_2_Stop,2020/02/14,"I am ruining my life bit by bit, and I am determined to stop drinking.  

This feels silly writing, especially as you're all strangers and I've never actually looked to a community (or even any single person) for help with my problems. However, I think this may be a reason why I've been having the issues that I do.

I am ruining my relationship with my girlfriend of 13 years because of how combative, stupid and sensitive (yet simultaneously insensitive) I become when I drink. I have no off switch, so even when I intend just to have a few beers, I end up going out and drinking 12 or more pints by the end of the night, starting some stupid shit, embarrassing myself and waking up feeling like a moron and trying to reconstruct what the hell I did the night before.

I've reached my breaking point, and I can no longer justify drinking AT ALL because sooner or later it turns out the same way all over again. I'm quitting drinking entirely, and I don't have anyone to talk to about this in my personal life, because I've kept my drinking problem private (for the most part).

I don't really know what to say other than Hello, and that I hope I can look back on this post in a few months, and then again in a few years and finally point to the moment where I said ""Full Fucking Stop"" and got myself and my life back under my own control.

Thanks for reading. Any links, tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.",8.2578775968557,6.701091525547447,8.564306569343067,71.20104716451436,62.57664233576642,11.350477259966311,36.40539023020775,10.214889679676881,3.555302414373947,1114,42,209,20,13,370,157,274,0.14,0.785,0.075,-0.9601,1,0,7,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,0,2,14,16,6,1,14,0,18,13,2,4,4,48,34,23,0,4,5,0,2,1,1,2,3,2,0,2,10,17,7,4,7,8,0,1,5,11,0,0,5,6,28,5,33,25,16,42,1,2,2,1,10,16,3,8,23,151,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.09371774194512453,0.0,0.0,0.09384572765302668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306161865711221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715093325065903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14769223593321465,0.0,0.17562882342387945,0.10606473665118296,0.08171996311869692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20969390548459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10771306800170212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5644750787340432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17011961575541104,0.0,0.0,0.12686236627018593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711785028625618,0.06860847383465173,0.0,0.10520325939186548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878416962206173,0.0,0.0,0.054579739442308164,0.0,0.0768091386922473,0.1058805479506712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06437122192725228,0.0,0.0,0.09538588469657988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10023712431963278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05277913270878548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20350019810729286,0.046918568579176735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1612928959168717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07665539464631277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406924664025362,0.0,0.0,0.1802474440671082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10399813904836132,0.0,0.0,0.1677106837769528,0.0,0.0,0.1815710130248458,0.0,0.09197639196807822,0.0,0.0,0.18378786484239315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021466079189075,0.0960624595014791,0.0,0.061523422264689126,0.09874148669893794,0.0,0.1031072288522588,0.0,0.0,0.09135267573634773,0.07637205609736678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858005706016508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06797510823624653,0.0,0.0,0.16058157941491358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07719047732657823,0.0,0.08841747928490336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061536292621721764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06520245958448942,0.10446010252067732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07622928028698743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08665797726096584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06822155334202955,0.0,0.0,0.12368867686242788
alcoholism,sjcrutch330,2020/02/14,"What's the best way to help someone and when to know to stop. My ex bf is a wonderful man but he has a real problem drinking. He is what I've come to know as a high functioning alcoholic. I got wrapped up in the drama for a bit, then I realized how serious the problem was and how deep the denial was planted. He has created a whole life around drinking. His father was apparently an abusive alcoholic and it seems he was emotionally abandoned as a child. A few of our mutual friends have hinted towards a problem but he seems to push all his non-alcoholic/non-enabler friends away. Looking at the situation now I can see I may have been one of a few people in his life that was holding him accountable. Guess how that worked out!? He dumped me because I was concerned and didn't approve of his behavior when drinking. There's been some times he's mentioned it was a problem but nothing stuck long enough to want to change. Would getting some other concerned friends for an intervention help? I really feel bad but worry the denial is so deep it's just gonna isolate him more. It feels helpless, what do you fine folks think? What would you have wanted to someone to do/say, (if anything). Seems like doing nothing is no help but I don't want to turn my back on someone I care for! Advice greatly appreciated!

alcoholism,First-of-Few,2020/02/14,"Where to start? Thank you in advance. Hi everyone. A little background about me to start I suppose. I’m male, 23, married to a lovely wife. I never used to really drink before I was 21. I’d been to the occasional high school/college party but nothing crazy. 21st birthday I went way overboard (as most do) and pretty much swore off alcohol because of how sick I felt all night. I could’ve sworn I was dying. 

I didn’t drink much after my 21st. The occasional drink or 2 I’d buy at the convenience store to have while playing Xbox with friends. And then something changed. I don’t remember when it started, but I started getting drinks every night. And then getting drinks every night turned into getting drunk every night. And then getting drunk every night turned to passing out drunk on the couch every night. 

At the time of writing this, I haven’t drank in 2 days. It’s not much, but it’s a start. Before today the longest I think I’ve gone in a year is 3-4 days, and usually because I was out of town.

I just want to learn to control myself. I don’t know why but I always feel tempted to get drunk once evening comes around, even if the same morning I felt terrible and said I wouldn’t. 

So there’s my story so far. I welcome any advice that anyone has.

alcoholism,museumlady09,2020/02/14,"Today I am admitting I have a problem This is very hard for me.  I am 42 years old, have two amazing kids, an engaged to an amazing man and my drinking leaves me in a constant state of misery.  So bad that I hardly value my own life.  I don’t mean that I want to kill myself but I know the implications of the drinking and I continue regardless.  I average 5-7 drinks per night.  It’s caused me to gain 15 lbs in a little over a year.  My fiancé has to know there’s a major issue and some days I wish he would just say it or confront me about it but he doesn’t.  I need to change my life.  I can’t go to a local AA because of my high profile job in a small town.  I need this to end or I feel like it will kill me.  I don’t even know where to start.

alcoholism,dimlighters-95,2020/02/15,"Is binge-drinking the same thing as alcoholism? So i can go weeks, sometimes even a month or two without wanting or needing a drink. 

However i always feels like im missing something and not really having that much fun. 

So when i do drink, i really do feel like i drink to feel emotions the way i used to. This normally means im drinking past the point of safety. 

Im not a particularly violent drunk. Ive never been in a fight but i do know that i can get a little creepy and handsy. This last bit absolutely mortifies me as I grew up as the only guy in an all female household so im incredibly ashamed of myself for making girls uncomfortable. 

I don’t know if anyone else is like this or has a similar problem. But just wanted to know if there is someone I could talk to.",2.8784615384615364,4.557123509554142,4.8282802547770745,81.95654091131802,75.05095541401273,7.888094071533562,26.72660460558549,8.617729084823388,1.9822870161685449,609,23,122,12,13,209,98,157,0.09,0.8029999999999999,0.107,-0.3271,1,0,7,0,1,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,7,9,2,1,11,0,14,6,0,2,2,31,29,16,0,8,11,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,0,2,6,2,6,0,7,5,0,2,5,5,0,1,1,3,14,4,14,27,4,14,0,1,0,0,4,5,0,5,9,81,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11856752043959667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09231594978938136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07757601449582853,0.11367727578936157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121124284236212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08858134373332249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.543424153751136,0.0,0.0,0.09268113677165103,0.12479930368045095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327877877746743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16829287539804308,0.15851967212030904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057964699650675175,0.0,0.0630531617833247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985397111333386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4793628222610095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18291904069942988,0.0904357880578117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16260781704858965,0.11119702662389387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405730856035382,0.0,0.0,0.12085270596184583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855602920764251,0.0,0.08155806685577137,0.08226504437784915,0.08556838561887031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870351226531824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437942336078115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591049943293336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10487981965834754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616032701995944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1421496818107636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400417567603132,0.08541164196289368,0.10972841910341306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08917418266808358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07370758465545202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837810928216804,0.0,0.0,0.09582171195149083,0.0,0.0,0.13087763657482346,0.08806376123584067,0.08899417948763577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10694797340275453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,RenoTrailerTrash,2020/02/15,"One YEAR ANNIV no Booze..whOOp!! It does feel like a Bday oddly enough! 😋 53, drinking hard for 30+.yrs. No meetings, no therapy, no scripts..tapered off .. just did the:
Suck it Up Buttercup, Life is Hard, but being Drunk, bloated, unhealthy and fat is harder. 
Self imposed therapy. Oh and I am a Chef so Alcohol is everywhere...overcame it. First 120 days?? Fuckin miserable... 6 months in? Still a lil sketch. 
But Today?? All Good. 

The best comment on my drinking at a PRO-Level was my 21 days in Donegal Ireland, the was year 2000. 
""Fek man ewe can drink lad, and not just for a Yank!""
-Kenny Kelly
 😆..

Alcohol has had it's fun, but towards the end??
 It became a toxic, love killing, dick killing, relationship killing, job killing, fucked up way to live. Now? 
1 yr later about say 65-85% of ""Normal"" haa. Physically? Awesome. Lost 40+ lbs. Work out Daily and looking/feeling good. I see a lot of Jaws drop when people ain't seen me in over say 9 months.

alcoholism,BubblePie5,2020/02/15,"Feeling really stressed out from family members addictions I have two family members with severe addictions. One is to hard drugs and one is an alcoholic. They are somehow still alive but have almost died many times each. It's actually amazing they're alive.

I can't really talk about it to other people because everyone has their own issues and I don't want to stress with them with mine. I'm also having a hard time with my own life right now so dealing with them is really stressing me out. Their binges sometimes result in really crazy things happening that makes me feel like I'm in a suspense or horror film. We can't cut them out of the family because they will die but at the same time it feels like swimming with a bag of rocks tied to you.

I don't even know why I wrote this because there's really no solution. I guess I'm just venting and hoping someone has advice on how to not go crazy.",5.091273408239702,6.054280617977533,5.773651685393259,80.08815543071161,68.66292134831461,9.304119850187266,27.754681647940075,9.516144504307137,2.3948524344569293,722,23,137,15,12,235,114,178,0.18,0.6709999999999999,0.149,-0.7361,0,0,2,0,0,0,10.0,1,1,7,0,10,8,1,3,6,0,14,5,0,3,0,33,28,9,2,2,5,0,5,2,0,1,5,0,0,0,7,14,1,0,4,3,0,2,6,4,0,3,1,5,19,4,22,26,4,15,0,0,0,0,12,8,0,5,7,92,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.10977886336787243,0.2452722449039992,0.0,0.10992878295886148,0.0,0.12022291129045262,0.11264746283897055,0.0,0.0,0.08996218706431859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20572766916855145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11597737468851547,0.0,0.0,0.23350403690506785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13045845069881748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430186688372427,0.0,0.0,0.10749376493837004,0.0,0.0,0.3181507384626393,0.0,0.17064251115971935,0.16073285844600546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06393348403976278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1239258925236828,0.0,0.09947893067030054,0.0,0.20154679415705853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11173288841573743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11741552182847773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061824293650877826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07945852435794724,0.10991872024585307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07509126617855567,0.11405224304809625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15245900646603516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07798984793251135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36033579269728616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960700899300444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12708729596045176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09531662323147827,0.0,0.1112604020645918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08983862855603576,0.0,0.3865878250160787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041919585191333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.074736659572638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19679016543725625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098912397741746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06635244809667294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10150921317585876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,bigjohnr,2020/02/15,"Experience/advice on recently quitting and problems with bowel movements - help may sound a bit gross...I started tapering down from 1 liter/day last Friday and on Monday morning had a final malt liquor at 7AM. Unfortunately I have been having to make a dump every 1-2 hours since then and my butt is really sore now from all the wiping. This happens overnight as well. All the other withdrawal symptoms (aside from insomnia) seem to be gone. Has anybody come across similar problems during their first week sober? For example - I have been awake less than four hours this morning and already been there three times and each time there is a good deposit left to flush. 

I have no idea what I'm doing so yesterday went and bought bananas, mango, apples and avocado. I had been ordering fast food or restaurant food recently. I'm not deterred from keeping sober, just want a more comfortable way to make it through this.

alcoholism,blasphemurder,2020/02/15,"63 days sober Holy shit. I didn’t realize how much I relied on alcohol until I got sober. It’s seems like everyday I am just crawling out of my skin. Although, I have developed a sense of clarity while sobering up, the levels of anxiety I have now is astronomical. Any ideas on how to curb that? I have tried smoking weed but I don’t want to learn to not rely on substances, but instead figure out a healthy coping mechanism. Thanks.

alcoholism,justalotofcats,2020/02/15,"Ideas for helping recovering friend Hi everyone, my best friend is currently at a rehab facility that doesn’t allow electronics (this is not his first rodeo, but the first without electronics), and unfortunately we are now 5.5 hours away, I always work on the days designated as “family days,” and I work evenings/nights, so the times that he can call me, I usually can’t answer :(. I will end up visiting him, but it’s been so hard to make it work, and obviously it can’t be a weekly thing. He says he understands, but it still makes me sad because I feel I’m not being as supportive as I want to be this time around because I haven’t really been able to see/communicate with him aside from letters we’ve been sending back and forth by mail. This last relapse was also pretty bad so I want to be there as much as I can even if I can’t *be* there.

I was thinking to surprise him with a nice book, but I don’t know if I should pick something that’s similar to his current situation/what he’s been through/going through. If I went that route, I was thinking to send The Lost Weekend by Charles Jackson, however, I have never experienced addiction myself, and he’s mentioned that at rehab they’ve watched “triggering” movies recently, and I don’t want to end up making it hard for him by triggering him. I also don’t know if self-help books would help/be interesting—he’s doing stuff all day in the “self-help” category, so I wonder, is that really a good gift to give? (If it actually is, please let me know!)

Alternately, I could send him random books that I like that I think he will too, but I can’t think of anything with that overall *hopeful* theme I’m going for at the moment. 

I guess I’m asking for advice on what to send/what to avoid and suggestions for helpful gifts of all kinds if at all possible. Thank you in advance and good luck to all of you on your journeys!",6.0510328099068085,5.753318367292232,6.838483339716582,77.66993744414657,66.39946380697052,10.42915868760373,32.23911655815141,10.07000556051586,2.9506349802119245,1473,54,300,31,21,490,187,373,0.057999999999999996,0.7879999999999999,0.154,0.9853,3,1,1,0,0,0,51.0,1,3,0,8,14,17,0,1,10,0,36,3,0,7,6,63,64,30,0,13,14,0,3,1,2,4,3,1,0,0,21,13,0,1,12,4,0,8,13,4,0,2,9,6,41,13,47,44,6,43,0,2,1,0,35,13,0,11,23,198,62,6,0.09677687512594407,0.0,0.09444026989085208,0.10550107869056258,0.0,0.09456924231961086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15478486414739107,0.08052611273861196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07963912230448779,0.08615193675110709,0.09047331432490956,0.0,0.09092505988074573,0.0744154432918548,0.08080464835738875,0.1179885696525922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10156135978596084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098820009806893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772684599820664,0.0,0.0,0.1872392349153322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1714311729264288,0.0,0.0,0.06392021329623901,0.0,0.0,0.0924744514647112,0.0,0.0,0.09123262494742014,0.0,0.048933295883419145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16463672108727692,0.0,0.0,0.14953914731377194,0.0,0.0,0.0928371970252172,0.11000105671607296,0.16234370261580233,0.0,0.0,0.10661063867260327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17338614239468514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3243374971397239,0.0,0.0,0.09612127338489868,0.09530572778208653,0.0,0.0,0.1092493122954644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10077822301689103,0.15955811890585486,0.0788860698651039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09896091165017327,0.0,0.0472802927977547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10564339130692786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19379794689395635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07114213850753805,0.0,0.07464029220223384,0.0,0.0,0.09081854146038527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10623194733811807,0.0,0.10910138571181467,0.0,0.0984568739177224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12399548863838945,0.0,0.09555548893766176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696085543949488,0.0,0.0,0.07711863973111624,0.0,0.20191877401713415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07450356656228717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07728613748736485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11078636835469052,0.0,0.10982125103506496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08909914423273721,0.0,0.0,0.06429425559935507,0.2480428556070299,0.0,0.0,0.1128627482899039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10074814002591956,0.0,0.0,0.10658605541729464,0.0,0.17124452505496893,0.0,0.07762857173491307,0.0,0.0,0.0897131328077727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09328945413056768,0.1049503928489834,0.21136415309612144,0.0,0.0,0.06874751542527545,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,flabbergastmas,2020/02/15,"Panic Attack While Drinking I used to binge drink EVERY weekend for two years. I never drank during the weekdays, (I did for a week straight after my 21st) but it was usually to the point where I blacked out or near blacked. So it was a LOT. However, I drank one night and I was pretty hungover the day after. While I was hungover, I was pregaming for something, I barely drank anything and I had a panic attack. I had to have my friend grab me and help me outside because I was not feeling good. I was able to act normally shortly after but, ever since then, I’ve felt slightly anxious in certain social settings. I only drank one point after that (it was 4-5 months after) and, while I didn’t feel as anxious, I felt dizzy, my heart started beating out of my chest, and I needed to go outside. I just want to know, is there any symptom like this? Will I ever recover? I don’t mind if there aren’t any definitive answers, but I do want to know if there’s anything that has these symptoms and what I can do to recover from this.",3.321626213592232,4.764070616504856,4.439016990291265,86.1688167475728,73.41747572815535,6.315048543689321,28.894417475728154,6.6274283507984215,1.4268262135922334,801,33,157,6,16,262,115,206,0.136,0.759,0.106,-0.7423,2,0,3,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,1,8,8,2,2,6,0,21,10,2,1,4,34,37,18,0,6,8,0,5,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,9,8,6,0,7,3,0,2,5,4,0,3,18,7,28,4,23,18,1,32,0,0,2,0,3,9,0,4,21,117,37,0,0.12453350851451615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16937411245168246,0.0,0.0,0.281374835135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20496093312969066,0.0,0.0,0.2833496883525519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07591447091221283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0803138105917516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24399085588475344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2252953762585893,0.10492485200966004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259357674363981,0.0,0.23914339527193115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09621427975959064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07077526276462942,0.104452798489684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14757280719516724,0.08347218570358368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13688071889394016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084078182970326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587393557863392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257433430869692,0.0,0.09940145837731247,0.0,0.0,0.092340018605157,0.09604791901367132,0.0,0.0,0.11686626160964812,0.12201639737677165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16877425664393708,0.09471334492010472,0.0,0.2922264799968579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23544883666688976,0.0,0.0,0.1266953487637289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10301540513697606,0.0,0.0,0.12694622905601985,0.0,0.09587197901122456,0.0,0.0,0.08814545829702519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2588759967507229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12165114239216054,0.0,0.0,0.10755696701187384,0.1371560656671788,0.0,0.14690617974761913,0.0,0.0998932687849092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08019549649188895

Women have impossible standards. Its as if you must be perfect in every way under the sun or no shot. AA ""promises"" never happen. Nothing good does.

alcoholism,Send_Bobs_cloth_off,2020/02/15,"Is this due to quitting alcohol or something else? I really slowed down drinking about 4 weeks ago and then totally stopped 2 weeks ago.   
I've been feeling kinda sick since then, can't seem to go to bed before 2-3 am, and always wake up around 7-8am unable to fall back asleep.   
I'm a student so I always feel pretty stressed but now it's at a whole new level, like I feel sickly all the time and have a really hard time keeping focus.   


I didn't drink every day but when I did it would be around 4-8 pints 2-3x a week, this is what made me want to stop drinking, I felt I couldn't stop myself once I started. But at this level, there shouldn't be any withdrawal right? And definitely shouldn't last over a month?   


Part of my thinks I was overly dependent on it to de-stress and now my body doesn't know what to do.  
Another part of me thinks it could be due to social isolation, I study an extreme introverted field and don't have any friends outside of school setting. Hitting the neighborhood pub was my main social outlet. Now I only have about 15 min of social interaction per week.

I’m not even sure if I want to take medicine that causes me not to drink,2.1989201877934264,3.81041483098592,3.6503521126760567,89.96782863849769,76.74647887323944,6.986854460093897,30.143192488262912,7.793537801064563,1.8971953051643191,267,13,58,4,6,88,43,71,0.191,0.7909999999999999,0.018000000000000002,-0.8811,0,0,5,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,0,3,5,2,0,1,0,1,6,0,1,2,13,11,3,0,2,5,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,5,2,4,0,2,2,0,1,4,3,0,0,0,2,6,2,12,10,0,3,0,1,1,1,0,1,2,1,3,33,11,0,0.1983180846951956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4238834403166693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15171279197135634,0.0,0.19667825035860706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12089286370827887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20372730221260196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1708110757496358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3885524450358315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309872245587743,0.0,0.1670915397445588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1833418736456659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17765405024523406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14007792818275935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665372434580186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15267495054335353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3738248956541897,0.0,0.14911051870062225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2541484418787864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11697314459762435,0.0,0.1590788051800239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19117155664881266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,lizardlover11312,2020/02/15,Advice on my dad Tonight my mom called me crying saying that my dad laid hands on her. He's never touched her before. He had been consistently getting black out drunk and peeing himself every night for at least a week and has been an alcoholic all my life. It generally never got this bad and when it did it was a one off thing that everyone forgot with time. Something has to change. They have children and I don't want my siblings seeing their dad this way. He was falling all over the kitchen in front of his 9 year old. He needs help and I don't know where to start. Him touching mom was the last straw. What can I do for them?,1.7811237980769228,4.024596835937501,2.5390625,94.39584134615384,80.640625,5.18846153846154,20.783653846153847,6.297961479604792,0.061042548076923,497,14,107,4,13,155,93,128,0.09699999999999999,0.882,0.021,-0.8293,0,0,2,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,3,0,2,1,0,0,5,0,14,6,2,0,4,16,22,6,0,2,0,5,3,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,9,7,3,1,1,1,0,2,4,1,0,1,9,6,17,0,13,13,3,22,0,0,2,0,21,8,0,0,11,71,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867771824286681,0.0,0.20426767248579225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15959168305827326,0.0,0.0,0.1626437861499454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951725798640276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021979465718796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2099553770459389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16104144049689625,0.18263990561372676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09986136371986784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528699800032725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281153203427148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10504407547270776,0.15580243111686376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13500594566821528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4477154512810476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14172590503454413,0.2948337774785101,0.0,0.0,0.17936943207098482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200566470450338,0.0,0.1295195984943117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15200007300162155,0.0,0.0,0.15231170186421664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14714685136591238,0.0,0.0,0.13528798283275292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269831460276584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145371163861396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1127377468317727,0.15171591234510004,0.1533188333645145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12308617099815937
alcoholism,backonthagrind,2020/02/16,"My mum's an alcoholic and can't support me anymore My mum is an alcoholic and has recently lost her job because of this. I rely on her financial support whilst at university (my dad died when I was younger) and now she's not even able to support herself, let alone me too. 

I don't really know what to do. I do a very full time course (\~45hrs per week) and I do have a part-time job but it doesn't pay enough to support myself. I have sent out babysitting and dog walking flyers to try and make some more money but I don't know how I'm going to survive. She made me live in my overdraft until I maxed it out so I have literally no money to my name anymore. I don't know how to cope anymore.

alcoholism,AARando,2020/02/16,"Today has to be day one I am at a loss with myself. 

I(23F) come from a family of alcoholics. I have my own struggles with alcohol and it's starting to take a toll on me. I have to stop completely. I've tried to talk to my mom about this and told her that I don't want to be completely sober I just need to cut down. I told her that I have it under control. She said to try to only have a drink on the weekends which sounds easy, but it's just not. I don't know why it's so hard to just NOT drink. I drink excessively knowing I have problem and I can't keep doing this to my mind and body. I confide in my mom about a lot of things but this is a sensitive subject because her dad was an alcoholic, my dad is struggling, and I don't want her to worry about me. All of my close friends like to drink, and I can't admit my struggles with alcohol to my SO. I feel like I can't find the right person to talk to about this. 

For me, there is no ""only drink on the weekends"". It has to be no drinking at all. I have finally come to accept that the drinking needs to end. I need to for myself, my mom, and all of my relationships. I don't know what I would do if I ruined any of my relationships because of my excessive drinking. I honestly don't know if I can do this. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. ",1.0250714285714295,2.5989413642857144,3.275142857142857,91.52985714285715,80.0,6.622857142857143,22.628571428571423,7.554174236665415,0.7603899999999997,1002,32,236,15,25,344,120,280,0.134,0.777,0.08900000000000001,-0.75,0,0,12,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,2,10,13,1,3,11,0,31,13,1,1,3,46,50,13,0,10,9,5,2,2,1,2,4,2,0,1,16,13,12,3,8,10,0,2,12,7,0,1,4,4,45,6,44,40,5,20,0,2,0,0,20,10,0,3,10,174,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.334851491341419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10653662131429928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09550067743861372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08700897205040085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349518208382498,0.1642588056316866,0.0,0.08785577528746959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050517531288984216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6138827484621907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06937872540016167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07384425044422238,0.0,0.039606912092674786,0.05596025414426175,0.0,0.08580865895023111,0.07159384683265009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06051895498906117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08636108691956783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07016990758475809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06962490368150888,0.0,0.0,0.17219643666847625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07653792235936953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06659489587001167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909278892352584,0.2752237751334883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17424611326774053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05307965546625917,0.11914972855184493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06839630706175318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07495295442657879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16819807840613366,0.0,0.06689492988707532,0.0745114803644328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05544365177910192,0.0,0.0,0.06548889293618793,0.0,0.2456682175662769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05889576569008565,0.1259202686572665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05204016781650081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0742493880630741,0.1496987850034522,0.0,0.10636430181999268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240425123979457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068226649143218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07954974603035421,0.0,0.11128932768092267,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,B1NG0BONG0,2020/02/16,"Is depression after kicking normal? I am completely sober for 185 days now and the last month or two I have been completely riddled with depression. I’ve experienced depression many, many times in the past. There have been a few times in my life that I felt incapable of functioning through my depression and I’m starting to feel that way now. 
The really big difference in my depression now vs my depression when I was drinking is how emotional I’ve been. I can cry at the drop of a hat. My head is so foggy and I’ve been shaking. It can’t be withdrawal symptoms at this point can it? It’s starting to feel unbearable. 
I’m starting to feel like at least when I was depressed and drinking I wasn’t an emotional crybaby. I don’t want to quit, but I have completely lost sight of the good and my “why”. I’m lost.

alcoholism,ntkstudy44,2020/02/16,"Tips on getting good sleep during withdrawals, i keep waking up throughout the night. I’m waking up 3 or 4 times a night drenched in sweat and having insanely vivid and anxiety provoking dreams. It feels like I’m not getting to the deep sleep phase and I feel/look so tired all day, it’s really affecting me. Melatonin makes it worse I think, but I also have trazadone prescription I could pick up but not sure if it’ll help. I’m only 3 days in but I’ve gotten clean before and remember the sweating stopped but the terrible sleep continued for weeks. I just can’t afford it to take that long.

alcoholism,LEGALinSCCCA,2020/02/16,"Vomited blood yesterday for the first time I vomited blood after just two beers. 
Freaked me out. Looked up my symptoms on google, and it said to go to the hospital. It's either no big deal, or it's potentially fatal. And I'm about 45 minutes away from the hospital. Ambulance took 25 minutes to get here. 

So went to the hospital, and they took blood, monitored blood pressure and oxygen. My Blood pressure was 180/102, which is extremely high. They stuck a tube down my nose/throat and found no blood. Did a rectal exam and found nothing. And did a CT scan and found nothing. So they discharged me and told me to follow up with my PCP. 

That's definitely a wake up call for sure. I'm only 33 too. I've been abusing my body for a long time, and severely the last 12 months. 

I need to quit, and get healthy. But it's so freaking hard. 

The craziest part? Even after vomiting blood yesterday, I still wanted to drink today. That's insane to me. I just need to remove it from my acceptable things to use or be around. But my brain still craves it despite the negative consequences. 

Thanks for listening. I don't have any friends up here and it helps to vent.

Have a great sober day 👍",1.6877777777777787,4.260346493506496,2.815930735930735,90.11215007215007,84.06493506493507,6.712265512265513,23.274170274170274,7.921354282810032,1.3947529581529583,924,34,188,19,27,295,132,231,0.141,0.7659999999999999,0.09300000000000001,-0.8366,0,0,2,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,3,2,13,10,0,2,13,0,9,16,10,1,1,31,31,19,1,3,7,0,1,0,1,0,4,2,0,0,11,15,2,0,4,2,0,6,4,5,0,2,13,5,19,5,30,17,2,31,0,0,2,0,10,11,0,2,14,116,30,1,0.0,0.15606424367565386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08957272946118865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11725691004576748,0.0,0.0,0.12375335911651016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14630895964260554,0.0,0.147040804874773,0.13449876390039264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08494718731216183,0.13579543283135725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290334550470543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08699847018223943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11203922931258342,0.0,0.4332658327588401,0.10176496899627972,0.0,0.13763439506806727,0.0,0.07485835199247674,0.0,0.0,0.14521951567807756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11799341993141535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08828777195445524,0.13916725634012456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10736771739397664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11656624949517552,0.11060991221104743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10513601884489368,0.0,0.0,0.19533439639001204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527738697506322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001774438618883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14263771463536953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14009826372501502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12529394287333576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14880380254050776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21038026567694784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12414261828777433,0.13690539413195735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126820051226155,0.0,0.0,0.08750755966233438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536116032072523,0.0,0.124853224507879,0.1258621552322791,0.2926869997267015,0.0,0.0,0.12866930735056725,0.0,0.0,0.11376202618412445,0.0,0.0,0.07769066538113409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12210386835476235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I suppose I just wanted to see what people here have to say to me",-0.6246926713948007,0.8199209042553193,1.9152482269503568,99.93388888888893,84.63829787234044,4.6033096926713934,13.635933806146571,5.033348758259628,-1.3614548463356977,311,3,82,1,9,107,65,94,0.042,0.882,0.076,0.2263,0,0,3,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,7,3,0,0,3,0,5,4,1,0,0,9,14,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,4,3,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,9,2,12,12,0,14,0,0,2,0,2,5,0,0,8,43,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14907031671767235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18303119320722724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507178412623524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14137231491183094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294846908594955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1846938790613223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864599136243525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18386294726528885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12047208290985585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2117143835386872,0.0,0.2057137348746892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23002401942514256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1519726125673116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20722430449785134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17432459007850667,0.0,0.0,0.17468198841822946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21936831037899435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14563338320182614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12782311357128226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18087120714797866,0.12929573726332078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19709611564812576,0.0,0.1978029286495965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2823281052418732
alcoholism,stigstig76,2020/02/16,"An interesting turn of events I just wanted to post this because I think it's going to be interesting for some. I'll also give the following disclaimer: I am not endorsing consuming alcohol to anyone.
My back story is similar to many; lots of alcohol missuse; bouts of depression; punctuated with months of abstinence here and there. 
So, I'm a teacher and my school has arranged for very expensive life coaching/ therapy sessions where everything is open for discussion. The guy with whom I spoke was just amazing and the conversation inevitably came around to my drinking problem. Instead of addressing the alcohol directly, he took me back to the roots of my problems - being bullied as a child; staying in toxic relationships far too long to name just two examples. By using EFT (google it - it's been a game changer for me) it became possible to separate my problem drinking from the root causes. My drinking has been a symptom, not the cause of my problems - it has massively exacerbated my problems- but it's never been the root cause. So anyway, I've spent the last six months hiding away and living a super restrictive life but last night I met up with a friend and had a few beers. Today, where I would have usually binge drunk myself into oblivion for a few months before getting sober again, I feel totally 'normal'. I don't want to drink. I know I don't have to drink. Drink doesn't feel important anymore. Who knows when and if I drink again. It feels totally different, like i can just live my life without constantly thinking and reading about alcohol. For context I'm 43 and have been dealing with the booze for many years.
Again, I am NOT advising anyone to start drinking, I just would urge anyone to try and address the root causes that may have led to their alcohol misuse. Much love",6.284745829502167,7.758826519637463,6.599647970576644,73.37888348876922,66.2809667673716,10.106974911335877,34.63299619072639,10.276239652853533,3.890108262183108,1442,67,240,36,23,465,190,331,0.07200000000000001,0.852,0.076,0.8201,1,0,14,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,1,1,23,13,0,0,20,0,26,21,0,10,3,64,50,17,0,11,12,0,3,1,1,3,9,1,2,2,11,17,16,1,7,13,2,5,8,6,0,2,11,4,27,7,41,34,7,36,0,1,0,1,18,9,0,4,21,171,38,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3755086939856518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056198245425949686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969311457165622,0.14741204562566956,0.0,0.0,0.06255892928715946,0.0,0.0,0.06602491604969306,0.1080730307483876,0.0,0.042838494779949055,0.0,0.05979816089234152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08037495363580137,0.0,0.288763809696072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07594143547566122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244960554307847,0.0605270580281337,0.0,0.0,0.07342157285205363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.550735630800151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06315791187118289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10659822793545493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054293665907308615,0.0,0.03671536451533411,0.06741340778788728,0.03993844240840701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06958249792011224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07724171546416443,0.11456569062841268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14891021879645353,0.03433242020264764,0.0,0.12410679687376297,0.062190447936857386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059744604449167286,0.0634252013727728,0.0,0.0,0.14249400009838514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16827656722023387,0.0,0.0516596164876489,0.0,0.05419978862857616,0.0,0.0,0.06594756806915537,0.06885378689047969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07922359184558687,0.06730324972388352,0.0,0.0,0.3362145518819645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.070293208535103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544818211818552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07112123339700671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049740434330365055,0.07490293769071489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07304179231048198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0803646622548204,0.0,0.0,0.0900577285275359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06661171644565421,0.0,0.07807721230257042,0.04771156300139879,0.07643814043685973,0.06864767370068077,0.0,0.0,0.060694338174516076,0.07739709349902814,0.057983567564934814,0.08289907758875267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06774181271225913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984153852704757,0.0,0.0,0.045254275193670944
alcoholism,Snarly-Creature,2020/02/16,"Am I an alcoholic? What constitutes crossing the line? I haven’t lost my job, I take care of my responsibilities and don’t drink in the morning or during any work obligations. When I drink though, I binge drink. Some days I can stick to only two drinks but it takes a lot of effort. I can go for days without a drink but I’m always looking forward to that opportunity in the next week where I can have a couple of beers.

I have a partner who I supported through several rehabs, who is now a couple of months sober. I’ve seen the torment of how alcohol can control a person but I feel like I’m not there. The deal is, when I want a couple of drinks I sleep out. I thought I could completely stop drinking but alas, a party led me to having a couple of beers over this weekend. Even though I wasn’t black out drunk, stable and had a taxi on stand by, I wasn’t allowed to go home, which has led me to question my behaviour.

I don’t want to quit my couple of drinks with friends on occasions. My partner needs to put their recovery first and for me, I have accepted that this will lead to a break up. I’m actually okay with this because I feel suffocated by this lifestyle and still trying to get over the horrendous events during their active stage.

I do understand that I am no better than them now however I believe that I don’t escalate as badly when I do drink. The more they want me to stop, the more I feel like I want to rebel against them. It makes me angry that I am being portrayed as the villain when I meet friends, which really is not a daily occurrence. I am confused whether I should start taking more steps to completely stop my once a week or two week binge. I enjoy it and I crave beers, which is making me wary and reaching out for help to you now.",3.1976616121308865,4.648999480446932,4.36067438148444,86.57146648044693,73.74860335195531,7.572386272944933,25.914205905826016,8.192908349453996,1.4966261771747809,1386,47,291,22,28,454,176,358,0.11800000000000001,0.727,0.155,0.8733,3,0,14,0,0,0,31.0,0,1,5,9,14,16,2,1,23,1,30,17,1,8,0,49,57,22,0,7,10,0,3,2,4,2,3,0,1,3,18,11,15,4,7,14,0,9,10,5,0,3,6,6,51,11,44,47,5,45,0,1,3,0,17,12,0,6,25,204,69,3,0.0,0.0,0.0702804140282556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1539333842956878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05992579807211915,0.0,0.0,0.04897557004940141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06013307827824176,0.04390227566783501,0.0,0.0,0.08114104964134085,0.0,0.0636951875737651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07342844080511547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15102165888502656,0.0,0.08077572995565646,0.057501523080583074,0.3984397361270984,0.0,0.09289293622584212,0.07424870016830973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6349631577544306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04756804550035741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10924531341646312,0.10290115503998036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06125955027257422,0.0,0.0,0.11128381143754244,0.0,0.03762709363335765,0.0,0.08186041630848928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0482729954292008,0.0,0.07224119518722008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07146800805467309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07036995038332097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060478044335999924,0.0,0.07861753560192966,0.061228203924214165,0.0,0.0,0.09614683765216178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05748509045807688,0.0,0.0,0.05340137266667605,0.0,0.0,0.07659330568661712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669816708926683,0.0,0.05477389657254708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0628844445468379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07239925348040469,0.08067805951844106,0.07660135367245882,0.0,0.0,0.04613738550945202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08136127031941875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07207127675144732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050975606660008985,0.0,0.05751467829914395,0.18063399179847267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08172660879480384,0.0,0.0,0.16244857379088512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415171249896715,0.057175252017690935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048896353669529616,0.0,0.1407047147778641,0.07497459507243699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16991531451353165,0.0,0.1733085314640858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06942400173510456,0.0,0.05243088288324173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,HereForTheDough,2020/02/16,"My brother (24) is a very serious alcoholic. Looking for advice regarding interfacing with him. Alcohol abuse comes from 3 of our grandparents. He got it the worst, by far, out of 8 kids. He's the 5th. I'm the first. I am 10 years older than he is. I experienced similar drinking issues when I was his age, but they did not manifest in the outwardly malicious way that his are. He looks to me as a 'kindred spirit' because I drink too much, but without it having an overtly negative effect on my lifestyle or without it impeding my obligations. I am aware that some people will want to make this about my drinking, but it really isn't outside of my brother using me as a poor example to justify his own habits.

He married his high school sweetheart after impregnating her when he was a few years ago when he was 22. At that point he'd had no history of problematic drinking. By the time his daughter was born he had been hospitalized for drinking two or three times, arrested about the same number of times, and spent 30 days in VERY expensive in-patient rehab with daily psych visits. He got out and seemed to keep it together long enough to marry his wife and have his daughter. 

Since then he has been repeatedly hospitalized during drunk rampages, with levels as high as .40, which is supposedly fatal for amateur drinkers without serious tolerances. He is very talented as a drinker and has talked himself out of half a dozen circumstances where he was dead-to-rights drunk out of his mind and facing a DUI. He holds himself together in social situations the same way.

All of which is sort of fine. However, we've reached the point where he sends family group chat messages attacking my parents brutally on perceived flaws in their own lives. He attacks my mother for how he turned out and blames her, and he attacks my father for his lack of presence while he supported our large family. He says more brutally ridiculous things to them than I would ever tolerate without immediate violence from anyone else. I would rip out a stranger's throat for the things he says to my mother, which are all baseless, but which shred her emotionally. After a week or so he'll wrap up the bender and have a sick day where he seems to reflect on his texts from the week prior and apologize to everyone with a grand gesture.

We've been through this a dozen times over the past two years. I've tried being his friend and letting him relate his drinking to mine, even though that is without real merit. I've tried taking a hardline stance and ignoring him until he goes a month without an episode, but that month never comes and I break down and communicate with him again because I'm terrified of the remorse I will feel if he harms himself or someone else out of lonely desperation. He got wasted and tried and failed to hang himself with an appliance cord once already after nobody engaged his insanity.

What the fuck do I do? I don't drink with him or talk to him when I'm drinking. I have abandoned the idea of comparing my regular heavy drinking with his routine drunkenness and week-long benders. We tried to quit drinking together last year and I went 4 weeks before finding out he never quit at all. Is there anything I can do to help him? Do I just prepare myself for the upcoming tragedy? His wife is completely worthless and does nothing to fight his issues except to call us brothers or my father to deal with his violent rampages once he's gone too far. I'm at my wit's end and he's not even my brother having the worst problems with substance abuse.",6.920599850968702,7.356878628912074,6.990402011922505,74.8229800670641,64.49925484351715,10.286751117734724,35.55294336810729,10.125756701596842,3.639377615499255,2844,126,504,60,40,912,330,671,0.20600000000000002,0.7340000000000001,0.06,-0.9990000000000001,3,2,14,0,3,0,57.0,4,0,3,5,20,29,9,0,34,0,44,19,2,4,6,94,70,46,1,6,22,13,1,0,2,5,4,2,0,1,19,40,14,4,8,13,3,7,14,21,0,7,17,6,71,8,94,45,15,82,1,4,2,1,98,32,1,11,40,340,90,3,0.0,0.13635964981942922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05623099643773475,0.05100898067297165,0.12299334013435632,0.0,0.0,0.06350085731953467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04023586350536002,0.0589602776328226,0.04735352734955065,0.0,0.0,0.19639265413178694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015615941392085,0.0,0.04896541451528785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058758508402218725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09913753189879544,0.06033343041175879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422179765344203,0.059324984480254674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05035684273931231,0.0,0.0,0.5637087756557082,0.0,0.0,0.09614068453764868,0.06472886988439724,0.05096660096717148,0.059457980918768034,0.0,0.0760140865676516,0.052051532935975725,0.0,0.05498543102756083,0.0,0.0,0.10849407867910434,0.0,0.029095802387924693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05259386075743572,0.048946605946631486,0.0,0.0,0.044458087289544035,0.05319818440967011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380687596186997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03857030086938877,0.12159606770856075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06495978544217766,0.0,0.12012125690762357,0.0,0.05114744704296546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04690576137408356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058842288824407014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05081210410491672,0.10184865275713363,0.09664435965872148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03841083842956326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058102690546642265,0.0,0.0918615973489326,0.0,0.042301209556805774,0.0,0.08876243273157615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05521469164059917,0.0,0.0,0.12256423511577598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06389542217780643,0.0,0.05493193259106089,0.03989352691108825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087947127901747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05506150909427243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12240952656366405,0.0,0.06549728051061987,0.036863940689913874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0491419693662106,0.0,0.09152205266565497,0.0,0.05823725382445625,0.0,0.10477116978378996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047600708389555914,0.0646814823759248,0.0,0.05865851250513995,0.04875655453578461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06529986097244775,0.0,0.0,0.043265669285063424,0.09250282488353376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07645889866296264,0.0,0.05653635164434723,0.0,0.13421667851782054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15627346558311742,0.0625909756322953,0.11242358454186356,0.0,0.06921793519534675,0.0496992446439412,0.0,0.14243863248589572,0.03394074028778494,0.09135095428354173,0.18463220529735108,0.0,0.0,0.05334354730561036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328201961372607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817547270161461,0.0,0.0,0.14822491597602294
alcoholism,ercdsy,2020/02/16,"Children of alcoholics Children of alcoholics,  do you think it is better to be grow up in a two parent home with an alcoholic father or with a single mother? I have a 6 year old son and 15 year old step son that are the main reasons I am staying with my alcohol addicted husband.  We don't argue and fight alot, he just goes on binges and disappears on us. Tonight he took our older son to a dance at school and told me he was coming right back home. He promised our younger son they could camp out in the livingroom tonight.  I had a gut feeling he was going to go on a binge. I could tell yesterday he was edgy and I told him he was acting like he was craving alcohol,  but he denied it.  Our 6 year old was crying and heartbroken that his dad lied to him. He kept saying he heard Daddy outside and would watch for him to walk in the door. Him making my son cry has me furious. This is inexcusable.
We are 41 and 46, so not young kids. I quit working to stay home with our kids. I have some money put aside,  but have no idea how I will work and get my son back and forth to school and childcare.  I don't have any friends or family that can help me much either. His family is no help and he is their golden child that can do no wrong. 
I just want to do what is best for my son.",3.4154307116104867,3.9621988014981286,4.5141011235955055,89.11849250936329,72.22097378277155,8.030711610486893,24.94569288389513,8.167268648758528,1.1756951310861423,988,27,225,14,18,324,148,267,0.15,0.767,0.08199999999999999,-0.9776,1,0,5,0,1,0,22.0,7,1,2,5,6,9,3,0,11,0,32,7,1,3,0,41,45,18,0,4,8,12,1,1,1,2,6,2,4,5,8,20,5,1,4,1,1,11,6,4,0,1,12,4,33,5,25,28,7,36,0,0,1,0,55,10,0,4,14,142,41,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10762365074616413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5275292612694547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06713565457323582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15182520934129526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036046687917659,0.08731328918920916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0850419200088703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1576460421830314,0.0,0.21688719238781684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18613626108593045,0.0,0.04991778294004218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07627385977057426,0.0,0.05157917627535148,0.0,0.11221416365270434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323451321988166,0.0,0.2970844395167703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114472949156438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04823152315026625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658989867235186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0725734443960279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3107824572665493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10962123582671184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09924481263041464,0.0,0.10500504669591526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10150463762709906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08430969276471195,0.0,0.07850922786524216,0.0,0.19982776599004126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21045313740940774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862890621216814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06325830501750165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886698826382988,0.10968591350251704,0.0,0.0,0.09643892984424596,0.0,0.11875272654701564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0582299289746736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14374438678992452,0.0,0.0,0.07013064398609062,0.10793911434451238,0.0,0.1907249132541844

alcoholism,ladymo0n,2020/02/16,"“Sobriety is a joke.” My boyfriend and I have a friend (he’s actually my boyfriend’s cousin but a part of our big friend group) who we can call D. 

D is a heavy drinker, revolves his life around drinking games and partying. I’ve reset my sobriety four times in the past year and a half, it’s obviously been very difficult. When I’ve slipped into drinking again, he’s my biggest supporter. He finds out I’ve broken my sobriety and gets so excited, wants to get wasted with me every time I’m around. 

When I’m sober, he tells me how lame it is, and waves drinks in my face, constantly offers. I’ve gotten use to it in the past, but this time around is different, I’m settling into a permanent sober mindset, something I haven’t done before. It’s really f**king hard. 

Tonight we’re hanging out, playing board games, small gathering. He found a way to turn it into a drinking game. When my boyfriend said we aren’t drinking, D announced to everyone here that I Could participate, if I’d drop the sobriety act. Then yelled “Sobriety is a joke.” 

I’m not sure why but it got me shaking inside. Really got in my head, I’m doubting myself and the importance of all this. This is just a frustration rant. Sometimes people really suck. 

Thanks for listening.",3.751942148760332,5.63782382231405,4.732305785123966,82.68573140495869,73.17355371900827,8.641652892561982,29.45537190082645,9.255337874911486,2.670805950413224,983,42,190,23,20,320,138,242,0.155,0.73,0.11599999999999999,-0.9,2,0,7,0,0,0,37.0,3,0,0,0,11,15,2,2,14,0,13,8,2,2,3,33,32,16,0,3,6,1,1,0,2,0,1,3,0,0,11,17,5,0,2,11,0,3,3,6,0,2,7,4,19,9,20,24,2,33,0,1,0,0,23,15,1,2,13,101,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.11423699272275566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3126337371672688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996123320764676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11953482083670085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12650394888539174,0.0,0.09346560011816388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12230633831168553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11979650271042065,0.0,0.5733878321146824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863096419841252,0.11185909624383984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10699382768050457,0.0,0.0,0.12835397687334127,0.18088578636204405,0.0,0.12232159075910358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872525913602394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10486581365057562,0.0,0.12014082216054615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08268534206281647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12676825547722065,0.22350052440195198,0.08115702255779135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2249814366732919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11135410154683434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901211252470146,0.11577869683703912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13284216012720085,0.11033087000128723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10231857220332524,0.10777625162531312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20478183146815912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12733136462528402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10110519252065547,0.0,0.09658956564994144,0.06904702688491272,0.09291947881655624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10563151130472456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753849921335814
alcoholism,andrewjrivers,2020/02/16,"My Dad is 30 Years Sober. My dad celebrated 30 years of sobriety on Halloween, of all nights. So my brother and I went to an AA meeting with him ([photo of him with his candle](https://www.facebook.com/events/2480731532052307/)). It was a cool experience and really special that he shared it with us.  
I'm a comedian, so,  constant travel, performing in nightclubs and getting paid in free drinks made my relationship with alcohol difficult. One night my best friend drove me home in my car while I puked out the window of the backseat. The whole time I was trying to say ""I'm sorry about this. I love you."" in between gasps of air. I drove the car to get detailed in the morning, and told the guy my friend puked to save face. It was pretty humiliating. I could keep lying to everyone but I knew the truth. Even while I was puking, I realized how annoyed my friend must be. and the next morning looking through my texts, I realized I was straining other relationships even if they weren't present at the night out.

After that night, I started writing a joke about drinking in moderation. I called it ""2 drinks is the new midnight."" -It's my dad's favorite joke and I thought I'd share it in here. Hopefully you'll get a chuckle and maybe even find some inspiration.

alcoholism,ramblinallonmymind,2020/02/17,"Admitted that I have a problem but can’t accept it As of this morning, I’ve admitted that I have a problem, but I can’t seem to accept it. I’ve been hitting it pretty hard over the past year and a half and as of somewhere in the past five months, I’ve completely lost control. It all came to a head last night when I got incoherently drunk and tried to coerce my SO into doing something she didn’t want to do over the phone which made her inconsolable. I then preceded to go upstairs and lose most of my motor skills. I was laying on the floor on my back when I realised that I had a small amount of vomit in my mouth, I tried to get up and go to the toilet but I was unable to stand so I decided to just swallow it and ended up choking. My SO was aware of this and had to scream at me to sit up and thankfully I did and it came out. I woke up this morning still completely wrecked and ended up being an hour late for work. I’m so ashamed of what I’ve become and even more ashamed of how I made my SO feel. Despite all of this, I still have the strong urge to drink and I can’t accept the reason why. I know why, but I can’t accept it. I’m in a grey area at the moment and I’m not entirely sure what to do moving forward.

alcoholism,myheadhurts000,2020/02/17,"Today I realized I might have a problem So I’m not sure if this is alright for me to post here. I wouldn’t call myself an alcoholic (maybe that’s just me lying to myself) but almost every time I drink I lose control. This happens maybe once a month. 


This weekend I almost died twice because of my level of intoxication and I’m honestly grateful to be alive and getting away with a few scratches. 


I’m just at a point where it isn’t worth it, I have severe anxiety for days after I’ve been drunk cause I don’t know what I said to who and how I got home. 


I’m 26 years old and drink like a teenager still and I don’t know when to stop once I’ve started so I might as well never start. 


Can’t really tell anyone in my life about this, just wanted to get it out somehow I guess.

alcoholism,KatIsWhereItsAt,2020/02/17,"My boyfriend needs help. How do I help him? I'm 23 and he's 26. He has an obvious alcohol problem. He gets drunk every other day (alone at home) when he's at his worst. He can barely manage a week without alcohol when he's at his best. 

I've tried for months to get him to book a doctor's appointment, but he's too proud and wants to manage on his own. He keeps telling me ""I'll stop drinking on weekdays and only drink on weekends"" or ""from next week, I quit drinking completely"". But then a couple days later, he falls right back into his old routine. 

He usually only drinks when I am not there, but we don't live together, so I can't be there for him every single day. When I ask him why he got drunk he will usually say something like ""I was bored"" or something. 

His drinking is a problem, especially because he has no money because he's studying. And the only money he has goes to alcohol. It is also a problem because I don't like him when he's drunk. And he sometimes misses school because he's hungover. 

How do I go about helping him? He wants to manage on his own, but he obviously can't do that. How can I help him at this point?",2.4430263157894743,3.866610470338984,4.204210526315791,87.04373327386264,75.65254237288136,6.832827832292596,26.404103479036568,7.475848149327749,1.3401050847457627,885,33,186,11,19,299,120,236,0.126,0.778,0.096,-0.7383,0,1,10,0,0,0,33.0,1,0,0,3,15,10,0,0,7,0,18,12,0,3,2,28,29,22,0,6,8,0,0,2,0,1,4,1,1,0,4,7,11,2,0,10,2,2,7,6,0,0,2,1,25,4,19,25,5,33,0,1,0,0,41,11,0,2,22,106,29,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3138823708455601,0.0,0.10139693937041837,0.0,0.078292188677136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09152514794504267,0.0,0.0,0.0752805897242093,0.0,0.2387205857076524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10274210190341744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026483773197328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10832669346927493,0.0,0.18941605936087733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10020683861307184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.479533408817032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1649733036801368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229950149500723,0.0,0.055639958949075856,0.0,0.07830116756544529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2624865697147567,0.0,0.09820368172821677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08701978997673772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565993741887294,0.0,0.08644925373834697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07814443701869166,0.0,0.0,0.07259308752599213,0.0,0.0,0.10411988055661636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027316730885008,0.0,0.0,0.2233766326298096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09254902839654618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28103695692734343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10413082087727553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360776735735567,0.0,0.07785559457654867,0.0,0.09908204396534286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15073947501377746,0.09682757472878266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08185045016629076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08557065735594248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06646902700029357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2156504282779553,0.0,0.11549026441210253,0.0,0.1570621473484387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08834132127923883,0.0,0.0,0.09437402790782548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Papadoodledoo,2020/02/17,"How can I support my spouse? My husband struggles with alcohol. Drinks a 6-pack a day (sometimes more) as a way of coping with his job, life, stress and anxiety and depression. He’s told me he wants to stop drinking and that he is always “so disappointed” in himself. He’s been drinking like this for years. 

He’s tried to give up alcohol before with varying levels of success. 

If you are now sober, what did you wish your partner had done when you were in the midst of giving up alcohol? What, if anything, can I do to support him?  Is there anything I should absolutely avoid? 

I know that this is all ultimately up to him, but is there anything I can do to make his fight a little easier?",4.180298507462688,5.598353000000002,5.1345074626865665,82.11758208955227,71.23880597014927,8.046567164179105,29.817910447761196,8.548686976883017,2.2565994029850747,538,22,104,9,10,176,86,134,0.126,0.769,0.105,-0.4482,1,1,6,0,1,0,19.0,0,4,0,1,6,10,1,3,5,0,16,7,0,2,1,18,25,10,0,5,3,2,0,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,6,6,6,2,1,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,17,4,18,18,2,13,0,2,0,0,21,7,0,2,6,76,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4547991625909072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11803461999917007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851859132368184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3502034266371696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12070805076731647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09148465920160816,0.0,0.12217939622607996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14516678838334862,0.0,0.4168913192101325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2721602446706776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407690751598972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07795972963440317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10019629356503376,0.06930312670062047,0.14217585165438684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09468923077784462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1402980988824838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11859702758404972,0.16249428036814856,0.14829751564957025,0.0,0.0,0.32195046284760714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355484123975985,0.0,0.09631014872396272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08366968077966784,0.11259779720498238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16312610583298232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09134988879257228
alcoholism,rremedyy,2020/02/18,"Girlfriend was finally honest - need advice I’m going to try not to type a super long post but I wanted to give a little background. Over the last 2 years now, my girlfriend has been drinking in secret. It was more apparent at certain times, and may not have even been everyday of the week, but it was enough to draw some real concern from me. We got into this fucking terrible cycle of me noticing her acting different, accusing her of drinking, her denying it, me finding the alcohol, fighting, and then repeating the same scenario about every 4-8 weeks. I’ve become a detective that specializes in alcohol, and I hate it. I hate feeling like I’m invading her privacy, finding the alcohol, and above all, being blamed for her having to hide her drinking. 

She would tell me things like “if I wasn’t so judgmental, that she wouldn’t have to hide it” and plenty of other things along those lines. Never did she come to me and admit her secret drinking was unhealthy and abnormal - until yesterday. 

She broke down, confided some things in me about how she’s been feeling and some past trauma she dealt with, and finally said, “I know my drinking isn’t normal, I was scared to acknowledge it bc then I would know I had a problem”. She then asked me for help. 

I feel like this is a huge step, and it took a ton for her to say that. I need advice on where to go from here though. I obviously can’t do it all. How do I help her? I really need some advice besides “go to AA”

TL;DR Girlfriend admitted her drinking is unhealthy and asked me for help, I need advice on how to help her",6.579313725490199,6.2862294150326825,7.047647058823529,76.59441176470588,65.30718954248366,10.20653594771242,33.35947712418301,9.773937934552695,3.112606535947713,1235,47,231,23,17,405,156,306,0.16699999999999998,0.718,0.115,-0.972,2,0,9,0,2,0,37.0,1,0,0,1,11,16,4,1,11,0,26,10,0,3,5,58,53,23,0,11,5,0,3,3,3,4,3,2,0,0,18,16,9,0,12,6,0,7,7,9,1,0,14,5,43,7,36,34,10,38,0,1,0,1,37,12,1,6,21,173,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33604080367654804,0.0,0.2756316588087999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16074319996280084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09494859339197477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405669916117773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08982175486965761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5053151162472044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08883137841533761,0.0,0.05678326092179721,0.0,0.07243456398973355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13040908178924293,0.12283588855349567,0.0,0.18835480697716475,0.1571524991287629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07947912083931281,0.0,0.08247154554225151,0.14657848549958705,0.0,0.06875913624772714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16975780408007868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304991147817867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944952030122569,0.07007811859897035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260037661303537,0.08616587069071266,0.0,0.07608193277301012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2549866445693013,0.06630639931935284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423366222876179,0.0,0.09787894327734263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08206937429895249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233678146355493,0.0,0.0,0.08226296411166821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09785420931402433,0.05507544344265889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08177843397928865,0.06836786221179092,0.08607231168808993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751427427059384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17134661963115094,0.0,0.08446640752909143,0.0,0.050130581188735014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551732483965084,0.058368898266390114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05070812526109891,0.0,0.13792205052198672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12214315018089544,0.0,0.0,0.055362725904015336
alcoholism,liftingaddict98,2020/02/18,"Is my father suicidal or helplessly by blood/genetics an alcoholic So long story short, successful business man with money to buy anything and a relatively easy life ( works from home ) but since I was about 7 years old ( my mother and him divorced when I was 6, with 15 years of marriage behind them. According to her he never drank for fun or had drinking binges ever ) 

He has a new partner since who loves him and tries to keep him away from alcohol. Well anyways, since I was around 7 he would get drunk for a few days in a row, not do anything but just sleep and drink/watch TV and he'd snap out of it. Many holidays were spent with him drunk for a week straight. 

Over the years it got worse where hed be drunk 2-3 weeks straight with a few months between Everytime and two of those binges over the past 3 years landed him in the hospital from alcohol withdrawal. Last binge was 1.5 years ago which was the 2nd hospitalization and he's been sober since.

 Despite the apologies and realising he's a moron who almost got himself killed, now suddenly after a business trip he's drinking again with the mindset that he's not gonna stop. He even asked my brother to go buy him a 6 pack the other day cause his fiancee and my brother threw all the alcohol out. I'm 21 btw and my brother a few years younger 


Is it possible he has some sort of long term depression that he deals with by binging every few months or does he just miss the drink that much? I know this wasn't too detailed but insight would be appreciated.",5.825823114083981,6.0750813277592,5.884988851727983,82.45632757339281,66.82608695652175,9.32002972872538,31.66127833519137,9.150863307647796,2.4802038647342988,1203,45,244,20,18,380,176,299,0.12300000000000001,0.7879999999999999,0.08900000000000001,-0.9257,0,0,8,0,1,0,23.0,0,0,1,2,14,9,2,0,20,0,20,14,1,1,3,42,34,18,2,2,10,5,0,0,2,3,5,0,1,2,12,19,11,2,2,8,4,3,4,5,1,1,14,0,21,4,34,13,8,44,0,3,0,1,39,13,0,6,28,144,33,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08626061229613229,0.41598482025569,0.09744322874555524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601578470952777,0.0866277045369215,0.09097294660312527,0.0,0.09142718689083816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09996552959083968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255154999538742,0.1003236963023042,0.0838140959107893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08515779046521504,0.0,0.0,0.3813121807433416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06427320801110646,0.08802365863367853,0.08198898272006097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050841147465939165,0.0,0.0553042647635351,0.0,0.1556575016993336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09761118659382907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0864947709423257,0.10766055589274663,0.0,0.053479755659181435,0.0793217124310946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06873386199442327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1722349090779172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08782726410637369,0.0,0.0,0.09865840320048942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1553459318197753,0.0,0.07153501577753625,0.0,0.07505248777081623,0.09398387765616464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10211185909190444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09289466437868983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10970389015532303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219877125353679,0.0,0.0973815954291624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135661946037911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064427880184766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06606799748294666,0.0,0.09505901814899156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15611453971843176,0.0,0.08749456182410871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07084379873743679,0.0,0.09916854694615823,0.13825433712798532,0.0,0.0,0.3759917912771424
alcoholism,briannabanana1,2020/02/18,"72 hours without a drink I am 72 hours without alcohol. I'm very proud of myself and really want to go a week or more.

10+ year daily heavy drinker but functional. Could get up, go to work etc. I have never gone more than a day without a drink in the last 10/12 years.
I also drink a ton of water on a daily basis.

As proud as I am I read online stuff about the benefits of quitting and it scares the shit out of me! At this point, I feel fine! Slightly ""foggy"" if you will, I also have had nothing to eat today.

Can I expect the crazy withdrawl symptoms that I read about?

alcoholism,funkshunning,2020/02/18,"I'm at the end of my rope - what can I do? Throwaway here, looking for advice, or commiseration, or something. I suppose I am a functioning 33 year old alcoholic - That is to say I have a job, I pay my bills, my kids are fed and my house is not a complete disaster. I keep trying to taper off of alcohol, or quit cold-turkey. I don't know that I've ever experienced any of the serious effects of withdrawal. The worst part for me is the anxiety and mood swings, the lack of sleep and feeling very tired all the time. Mind you, I haven't gone more than 2 full days without it in the past 6 years. Drinking has been problematic for much longer, back to my early 20s.

I also have this issue that I'm sure a lot of you experience. If you cut back on the alcohol, you just find another substance to abuse. Benzos, weed, sleeping pills. I just want to be clean and sober and able to function. I'm in my mid-30s with heightened liver enzymes, told I am developing a fatty liver years ago. I'm sure it's worse now. High blood-pressue. Unable to cope with life without something coursing through my veins.

It seems whenever I give in and get back to accepting my drinking, I get worse instead of better. I need it to alleviate my anxiety, for sure. I have always had an issue with anxiety and depression. In fact, I've never been able to hold down a full-time job for more than a few months at a time before developing a drinking problem. Not since a traumatic event in my early 20s made any issue I had many times worse. Booze helps me get to work and function. Prescription medication never helped as much as the alcohol has. 

I also enjoy drinking. I like the taste and I like the way I feel before I have too much. I like that it numbs my anxiety and feelings of the world being utter shit. I think it used to amplify my mood swings, but I've been able to learn better ways to cope with those so I don't fly off the handle.

I suppose my interest in any hobbies I've had has largely diminished. My brain feels fuzzy at most times. I used to do stand-up, I used to be in a band, I used to make art, I used to play sports. Alcohol has added a good 50 lbs to me and made me sluggish, physically and mentally. I'm still not sure that it isn't a fair trade though, to use it as a medication in place of the plethora of prescribed ones that haven't ever helped.

What can I do?",2.8135517370590466,4.388970052192072,4.3749478079331965,85.57205824099357,74.99164926931107,7.668561640169157,26.0607569187945,8.384062270229773,1.6636320432525022,1841,66,386,33,39,616,228,479,0.08800000000000001,0.813,0.099,0.8056,2,0,11,0,1,0,62.0,0,4,0,5,16,23,2,0,29,0,33,25,7,10,10,67,65,24,0,5,12,0,4,3,0,0,11,1,1,1,18,16,12,2,11,8,3,1,12,7,0,1,11,8,52,14,62,51,13,47,0,1,1,0,12,19,1,7,28,246,70,6,0.19518953496839547,0.07708922710286381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0635789848441106,0.05767458189561904,0.3476637532551877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10406200039612616,0.054137776467113166,0.0,0.0,0.13273557711286596,0.06822441543447774,0.19909261332476186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15008870405973904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11072794524636713,0.0,0.0,0.11508618784682285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.072632024693223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06821750459268483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0419603674757585,0.0,0.05603882015141722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2549485797826294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05762666421954246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11770673946045555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06364427304478475,0.0,0.0,0.13159159155911432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05946656626817861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1019784758700244,0.062414529268275565,0.0,0.05457190707557615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13083143087050245,0.06874282011440619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07507417223497187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2037271626737594,0.1291303301445347,0.057831142365768334,0.0,0.0,0.03575702125709874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045956046996171014,0.09535974738131728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0546366832109632,0.0,0.0,0.055314387528768515,0.0,0.1231287049817402,0.04343017675432757,0.06596385074967477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310886143333954,0.06556838072652177,0.0,0.06569526267878871,0.0,0.0519328081983288,0.0,0.14348676699751076,0.04824352231381604,0.1003614682805114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06827286084513469,0.0,0.04408849347981812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07045708176314856,0.06211016576119315,0.0,0.0,0.06797717335572398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0622566746807525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06920269893121846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051740850847049116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059231073942993324,0.0,0.0,0.06678641756535683,0.053820933452952,0.0,0.1302203323441305,0.0,0.0,0.10017762674436816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051959538254120564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2452851023126012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04168985753325363,0.06392424235834979,0.0,0.1517554500169754,0.07478055230187597,0.0,0.062170655108686364,0.0,0.04417362722198774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3371621762541374,0.0,0.05368393608357113,0.03837594830360975,0.10328824502193568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254371642364898,0.0,0.04736676871771118,0.0,0.19891481164128688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12569566097936427
alcoholism,Grandsouls,2020/02/18,"I think I have a drinking problem. Every week or two I find my self drinking in massive excess to the point of not remembering things and even how I got to bed or that I made food. I almost always have a few drinks every night wether it be beer cocktail or wine or all of the  above. I used the excuse for all my life “to go to sleep” but lately once I start I find myself drinking many drinks far past the time I should even be going to bed or until I don’t have an option but to go to bed. &amp; It’s not a nice have fun drink either it’s a dark depressing self loathing drunk. It’s been happening almost weekly now and accelerating. 

And I’m sick of drinking away all my money. I’m quite depressed last few months / year, as depression got worse so did the drinking. I know it’s shit for depression and I know it’s shit for my health. 

When I stopped drinking for 7 days I lost my appetite completely, smell of food made me want to vomit only time I could eat was if I got super high and I could eat some yogurt maybe if lucky. I lost about 13 pounds in one week. I had extremely bad diarrhea body cramps etc when I went to doctor he even recommended not quitting cold turkey as it can have some pretty serious side effects apparently. 
And I broke down and started drinking again because I was too weak to the withdrawal and I am addicted. But this is getting stupid and I’m being very stupid. 
If I’m going to do this not cold turkey thing I need to get control of this because I think I do have a problem. I need to quit cold turkey and deal with withdrawal or get my head out of my ass and limit myself and eventually quit. Any advice on the topic I’d appreciate on limiting myself or how to make withdrawal a little better. Either one or maybe your own story. Regardless I need to fix this now, I’m tired of it now, I’m done with this game.

alcoholism,BluStargazer,2020/02/18,"Bored at Work after Quitting Drinking? I quit drinking 3 weeks ago from being a borderline alcoholic and I am now starting to see several benefits in my life. My skin is not as dry, I am just now able to get good sleep at night again, my mood swings are beginning to die down, and I have more desire to chase my hobbies like art and music. 

But.

9am to 6pm, Monday through Friday, I am now IRREVOCABLY bored at my job. Bored to tears is hardly even an understatement. I work a dead end position with no opportunity for growth and hardly anything to learn. I build spreadsheets all day. I never drank during working hours so I don't understand why it feels like I'm so bored now. Maybe I just looked forward to alcohol after work? I don't really want to quit my job, it's a great seat for me at this point in my life, I'm just so bored!

What can I do? I've tried a few things that I found online. Here's what didn't work for me: I find it impossible to find challenging situations to put myself in at work, setting objectives just makes me get done with my work too fast and I have hours of the day on my hands that I feel guilty for, there's no promotion for me to shoot for, and I typically work quick and efficiently.",2.878373493975907,4.397557269076309,4.382769076305223,85.81511746987951,74.70281124497994,8.032208835341365,24.096586345381517,8.697196308434329,1.4752745381526102,956,29,207,19,20,319,141,249,0.128,0.764,0.10800000000000001,-0.4901,2,0,4,1,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,14,17,13,0,0,6,0,15,10,3,1,2,27,30,12,2,2,6,0,6,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,9,9,5,0,7,3,0,3,7,5,0,0,4,8,31,7,36,25,3,36,0,0,2,0,0,12,0,0,24,129,40,13,0.10129187264735602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08978913350000751,0.2165004140689916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833545805618891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13064975637999168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10512497188367237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10365675350527463,0.0,0.19845494595149094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08971453414492182,0.0,0.0,0.06690232657717582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102432428581483,0.07236293405834428,0.0,0.0,0.18515787308537449,0.0,0.0,0.11106131014811607,0.0,0.0,0.10584164558074816,0.0,0.0,0.084958817016255,0.0,0.11167464718543353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18147524428127126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995041817273704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010331080203009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14309089041476886,0.09897218505076533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08505966201376895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761311153639159,0.0,0.10176130062730222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0781225366315149,0.0,0.0,0.09505556077991033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09575356007837353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018263090135451,0.0,0.323209124470549,0.0,0.0,0.06489016734453018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071650819698188,0.0,0.0,0.11443098450624245,0.0,0.0,0.11385630881872615,0.10136502442638974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07169490880620595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06729381933081817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06877053255440946,0.0,0.0,0.1054484116756491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059744570869337175,0.0,0.08125023040613752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09140016012129387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5899335173412478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,SabinaSanz,2020/02/18,"Need advice. I binge drink about once a week, I party too much. I don't drink daily. I need advice and support. I don't drink every day. I don't get the shakes. I can go days or weeks without drinking. But I like partying too much. I have trouble with setting limits. Maybe 5 years ago it was more innocent and acceptable. I'm 30 now. About once a week I go out and I drink way too much, I don't pass out or puke but I certainly put myself in sketchy situations (I'm an attractive woman so I do get a lot of attention). More than anything I put myself in danger, I don't go home at the time I'm supposed to and I just end in situations that I shouldn't be in. For example, a couple of weeks ago I lost my bank card, the other night I went out my friend left and I stayed by myself (it shouldn't be but it's stupid and dangerous) and I met a guy that was in sketchy business and I feel like he could have hurt me if I stayed longer. On top of that, the next day I'm absolutely hung over and useless. That night I have trouble sleeping because I get anxiety and end up sleeping late and the following day I'm exhausted. It takes me 2/3 days to recover, thus I waste 2/3 days of my week.
The trigger is strange, I can have a casual beer with lunch and not even think twice again about it. It's just when I go partying I tend to exceed myself.
What advice can you give me? Should I just stop drinking all together? Do you have any tricks to identify your emotions and analyze them instead of just ignoring them and drown them in booze?
It's quite conflicting because I'm a foodie and knowledgeable about wine and beer, it's something I love. I will absolutely not drink something I dislike (bacardi for example) also, I've been always super fun to hang out with, dance and party. It's kind off part of my personality -sigh-
I don't know what to do.",0.9794147869674176,3.2569834552631605,2.9059398496240623,90.3432456140351,84.18421052631578,6.461152882205512,22.205513784461154,7.7094869923839395,1.0429724310776929,1443,50,311,27,42,482,180,380,0.152,0.7120000000000001,0.13699999999999998,-0.7223,0,0,12,0,0,0,46.0,0,3,3,5,18,25,4,1,14,0,28,16,2,2,2,58,55,26,1,7,13,0,1,2,1,4,1,0,1,3,16,24,12,4,6,12,1,12,11,12,1,1,6,1,52,12,39,42,8,58,0,3,0,1,14,17,0,4,27,197,68,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22562638733255674,0.13644872946546274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06154846412837394,0.06404061002463841,0.0,0.0,0.05233848331053463,0.0,0.05887761393591034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06333520644118575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09383366115055797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06144987190649765,0.0851597294671891,0.0,0.2978143217578875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5277712046817732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08657467703663797,0.1363353639965735,0.0,0.0,0.05083431092326075,0.0,0.06484589098389526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03891555189137652,0.05498343745935198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05946256370044727,0.0,0.12063228729141555,0.07383133903124177,0.17496274278925508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07620693216911603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07720164532695634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08239206401459356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08014665876335213,0.042297663542934814,0.0,0.08681928193840817,0.0,0.08362212901800288,0.0,0.0,0.07520191127914416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08401581790403782,0.06543244572730933,0.06946344502286624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0773211614707654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16973323783561248,0.11413636836713552,0.0,0.0,0.08185259400419544,0.14445189513990295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16392931145471176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08334502802140044,0.0,0.0,0.06720241230652388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.154741113422758,0.0,0.08186119460592879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1730225927610856,0.15404011884372756,0.0,0.0,0.1185020284574677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16406778320655682,0.0,0.06434574867648843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08733837597232241,0.0,0.0,0.057867708053887225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04931572891420223,0.0,0.0,0.044878605235820365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061090819121443325,0.3086813035035205,0.0,0.0,0.07134684087980722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419100895606026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049562599549186015
alcoholism,DionRifkin,2020/02/18,"Even if you feel like you could quit drinking, how do you get past the notion that there is literally nothing else in life that can provide any sort of satisfaction? Title kind of says it all.  I drink on average 4-6 drinks daily, but can pretty often cut myself off at 2.  I’ve started to recognize that my health is far less than perfect, the regular hangovers are debilitating, and I don’t really enjoy it the way I used to.

But even in making several half-baked attempts at cutting back or stopping all together and in realizing through reading TNM that a life without alcohol is very possible, the biggest hurdle that remains is that I cannot for the life of me imagine even the rosiest of circumstances providing the sense of ease and contentment that pouring a drink does.  

I’m sorry if this post just sounds cynical, especially to those who are successfully making early strides, but I guess what I’m trying to get over is how one (especially someone who’s hardly ever known what it means to not be depressed) answers the question of “what’s the point?” when quitting would mean a life that’s invariably just as unfulfilling but experienced in a body that’s undeniably healthier but also more cognizant of its empty existence.",11.79127192982456,8.691153127192987,11.21368421052632,59.7874561403509,57.20175438596492,14.519298245614035,46.38596491228071,12.650343791298138,5.846522807017545,995,48,165,25,9,327,149,228,0.057,0.823,0.12,0.9586,0,0,5,0,0,1,18.0,0,3,0,5,13,9,3,0,13,0,15,11,1,5,4,38,27,16,0,4,12,0,2,1,0,1,6,2,0,0,20,3,5,1,8,5,0,0,4,4,0,1,0,5,11,5,26,24,4,21,0,1,0,0,7,12,0,7,8,115,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12729875281849135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09525700293884856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08100294831285808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09159283292193154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13231099651566589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09510441424793616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10259441555097903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10423919326995693,0.0,0.0,0.4667532340559016,0.0,0.0,0.09950611328539756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2360249361338201,0.10774721977307188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06022861647939715,0.0850964770254757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12446636221575505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13121967677250904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670451769702008,0.0,0.0,0.12661471233006935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12404095890087365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365405459905103,0.05819404907312769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15902167780644355,0.0,0.0,0.2595044357281688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11429499150812115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071606805538173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11370967730631082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11260309896703573,0.13428536538929992,0.11408017827157438,0.12118377051647145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13343715404561876,0.2533890054149959,0.11914821043358663,0.0,0.0763087443381014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947258050476485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13456714781889306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10092657988395268,0.0,0.0,0.1333405829173067,0.08431090087021376,0.0,0.0,0.09958628956190337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08087192869802126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287795830707012,0.0,0.09828315500020043,0.0,0.09454871732380522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11482355016078423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846165717168332,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,kwhit2491,2020/02/18,"My husband and went to in patient rehab tonight Today was a super emotional day to say the least ... my husband has really struggled with alcoholism &amp; binge drinking. (Something I will never understand) I have tried to be supportive during this entire thing. We have been married 5 years &amp; before we got married I had no idea about his substance abuse issues. (Previously was addicted to adderall) we just had a baby three months ago, he swore he would stop drinking when our son was born but that did not happen. 
Just like I can’t imagine being an addict, I don’t think the addict can imagine what it’s like to love an addict. It is so hard sometimes... especially when you bring a child into the mix. (unplanned but definitely not unloved) 
He was super drunk today and his aunt and uncle were over to talk us through some things... he just admitted he will never be able to truly change until he gets actual help. He has obviously wanted to stop, he has tried to stop on his own way too many times to count, but has never been successful. So we figured out insurance, time off work &amp; all within an hour and got him packed up and dropped off to a rehabilitation center 30 minutes away. I don’t even know if he will he paid for his time off. I think it’s supposed to be 30 days. I can’t speak to him for the first week and I think I can visit him on the weekends ... I’m just obviously used to seeing him everyday and him at least somewhat interacting and helping me with things. I know it’s not forever... but 30 days seems like a lot, especially with a newborn baby. 
It was hard with him living here and being drunk every night but his presence always comforted me, he has a good heart and despite all the bad times we have good memories too. I love him and I want to see him better... better for himself, our child and me. 
I guess I’m just trying to vent, see if there are any others out there who have been through something similar and can relate. How do you get through the loneliness ? The hopelessness ? The fear. I do believe in God and I’m really trying to press in but it’s only day one and I feel so sad. Have your loved ones who attended rehab stayed sober ? How have their ( or your) life changed? I understand the urge will always be there to drink as an addict but how do they stay sober after rehab?",4.123751460849242,5.562820165562918,4.974829892221791,83.12618718348267,71.40618101545255,7.801817945721336,26.347811972471103,8.313332769828598,1.682605817426309,1817,59,354,28,34,590,227,453,0.11,0.758,0.132,0.9338,0,0,6,0,1,1,64.0,8,4,2,7,21,21,0,2,21,0,46,19,1,4,7,80,78,35,0,5,18,4,4,3,0,5,10,2,0,3,15,27,6,3,14,6,1,4,11,6,0,4,16,9,50,15,48,51,8,56,0,2,3,3,59,17,0,8,34,244,65,2,0.07397592276768652,0.08764937184729918,0.07218982946611227,0.4032233753654453,0.0,0.0,0.06557519208178476,0.07905776392395453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12310778766066227,0.24045864423592286,0.0,0.05030616422450915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950281457870851,0.0,0.06176680553465996,0.0,0.0,0.06294806169113656,0.08334553256835919,0.0,0.1308513841968402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15651343486179764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19083340123904016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174047241531985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321295622665346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04886039930451306,0.0,0.06232790548716284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08324347964440114,0.03740444927912065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0629238821155765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729873280500213,0.0,0.0,0.12409498850730437,0.1183306065329449,0.0,0.08149281904788408,0.0,0.06541666419422848,0.0,0.1325357928956089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08766182465988963,0.09916900337130576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07285138261129623,0.0,0.0,0.08350981242445132,0.0,0.07721164382134613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08131046503121056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052251381978763035,0.10842269758830013,0.0,0.06532209510559983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06289168413305482,0.20029847553208224,0.0,0.0,0.07499997470623497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05904687578169648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17116437632825895,0.0,0.0,0.06942139225103296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10025599955862696,0.05626202274757413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09478174077348384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058828622960991915,0.0,0.0,0.17684769825251506,0.06734490174634833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11390055896631085,0.07316407917668924,0.0,0.0,0.1576969817212669,0.0,0.1855415515690086,0.0,0.0773356963716213,0.0,0.0,0.08394700050242428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0594590445625155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14743894800593946,0.14220235287807134,0.0,0.0,0.17254382185780104,0.0,0.14024105001231074,0.0,0.0,0.200899182608624,0.0,0.0,0.15402308900439998,0.08898392667439603,0.06389144560132208,0.0,0.0,0.08726583179690134,0.058718644197214113,0.05933902308536356,0.0,0.0,0.06857642153870129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05385535282386369,0.0,0.0,0.05255037306125153,0.0,0.0,0.04763806886649092
alcoholism,throwthatsaway78,2020/02/18,"How can I positively support my partner M29 who is still currently struggling with alcoholism without lecturing them or scaring them away? I knew that he struggled with alcoholism in the past when I got into a relationship with him, however when faced with me letting him know that maybe he is not sober enough to drive last night at a family dinner, he got very defensive and claimed it was not my place to lecture him and I did not need to worry. I was hurt by his defensiveness and the way he was ok with distancing himself from me over alcohol. I know that it is a internal struggle for him and he has since apologized to me for getting too aggressive in our argument. After some talking he agreed we should sit and then go home to avoid him going off the deep end  (there was an open bar at this event). I am so proud of him for eventually showing reason and responsibility. However before this situation presents itself again, I need help knowing how I can support him without lecturing him, and making him feel like a bad person or that I am better than him. He seems to turn defensive very quickly even when i bring it up gently and caringly. I know it is not my job to fix him, but I care about him deeply and I want to support his growth in the right direction.

I have been drinking a 750ML of brandy everyday for the last 3 months slowly throughout the day, I completely enjoy it and am fully functional throughout the day without causing any forms of problems or issues to my schooling or the people I an around, But I am wondering how this type of drinking will effect my body and health, so far no issues.

alcoholism,Bronz23714,2020/02/19,"My first speech in AA ""My name is ___ and i didnt think that i was an alcoholic. When i was stabbed in the face i was drunk. When i was jumped i was drunk. When i did harm to others i was drunk. When i neglected my children i was sadly drunk. When my family asked about my independence i was on my way to get drunk. When i lost countless jobs for being absent, i was drunk. Being a neglected child put much hardship on my soul. Seeing my mother cry because of my father having an affair with her sister made me realize that blood isn't thick at all. The rape i witnessed at 7 years was not easy either. My circumstances seem to burden what should be let go. But it burns in me. No matter what i do. Even the military didn't seem to soothe what discipline i so often needed. Like they say liquor is cheeper than therapy. But im here now. And today may not be the first day in my sobriety, but i hope its the first step.

alcoholism,galacticspacewitch,2020/02/19,"Alcoholic Brain and Medication Info Disclaimer: Not a doctor, but wanted to share some of what I have learned about the alcoholic brain and medications that are being used to assist in recovery

The Alcoholic Brain: 
PET scans have shown that alcoholic brains show a decreased metabolic rate compared to non-alcoholics of the same age--depending on length of use and other factors. This just means that the brain has adapted to the chronic presence of alcohol, and *in the absence of this addicted ingredient* the neurons of the brain become somewhat less efficient in terms of metabolism. The good news, is that with prolonged abstinence, the efficiency returns to the same as those of non-alcoholics of the same age. (Picture: https://www.medicalimages.com/imagePreview/01B0W88C?imageId=22449239&amp;imageCode=01B0W88C&amp;contributor=ISM&amp;siteName=www.medicalimages.com&amp;title=&amp;location=&amp;ds=800&amp;newStyle=1&amp;tc=FFFFFF&amp;tbc=333333&amp;qv=95&amp;icc=1&amp;cl=1)

Medical Management: 
Medication is not for everyone and obviously should be discussed with a doctor. But here are some of the options that are currently being used to treat folks like us. 

-Naltrexone 
Naltrexone is a mu-opioid blocker that blocks endorphins. Endorphins are actually thought to play a large role in the process of cravings in the rewards center of the brain (Nucleus Accumbens). Naltrexone can be taken as a once daily oral medication, or as a shot once a month by the name: Vivitrol. Folks who take this medication sometimes report dry mouth, insomnia, or other side effects. 

-Acamprosate 
This medication can help with cravings by a different mechanism; it works to help balance out the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate. During drinking days, GABA used to be increased. According to opponent process theory, ""what goes up must come down"" in a way, so early sobriety often entails an opposite shift of low GABA and high glutamate. 

-Disulfiram 
Most folks probably know this one. It blocks the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing a rapid build-up of acetaldehyde in the presence of alcohol. Should one drink while taking it, within 10 minutes a classic and terrible reaction occurs including face flushing, rapid heart rate, and vomiting. The concept is to recondition oneself to associate alcohol with the nasty consequence. However, this medication is falling out of favor because the reaction can be deadly. 

Final thoughts: 
I've heard of whisperings of a patch being developed that combines naltrexone and acamprosate. Idk, just am interested in these things. Hopefully you found it interesting, too. Certainly these do not replace 12-step recovery, exercise, meditation, or anything else that works for you!",12.17982807515066,15.117358332506207,10.051005848989721,48.637168114143954,53.76426799007445,13.300567174760722,43.92139312300603,12.540900571622839,6.900790925203829,2260,119,260,76,28,684,229,403,0.046,0.8290000000000001,0.125,0.9884,3,0,12,0,0,1,113.0,1,2,0,4,7,13,0,0,37,0,27,35,11,6,3,61,43,20,1,5,10,0,0,1,0,3,22,2,1,0,27,17,9,3,8,5,0,3,3,2,0,2,5,3,5,11,56,28,10,31,0,1,1,0,11,18,0,10,10,187,32,7,0.0,0.0,0.04621213265427018,0.05162448020586535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45547760823661404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6157159171854107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038969537980546656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0288674706180681,0.05230042442694266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37005076193482106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04864713871707072,0.0,0.0407925663711346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030540377079931562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04947641386389359,0.0,0.09694071286956013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927807146476113,0.0,0.0,0.03955944010157469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045250205480745334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05187563077997743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051922856726185816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03971954299546929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056116490367938233,0.06348278106319448,0.05003368116460755,0.0,0.047034692316043215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026025341962932463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023135503162239657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05158401751577577,0.0,0.3816454386335422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037798704840061766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10086411472885147,0.06417861886160277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05105723376644942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046835796087146164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07121087854816584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03146088709931516,0.0,0.0,0.07518994779173024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056962830553649965,0.16359977472934129,0.0,0.0,0.027931498280354745,0.03758858824004208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06895072968712873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,spicemastergrimm,2020/02/19,"I’m 23 and have been drinking for 5 years Howdy folks, I’ve been drunk most nights of my adult life. I’ve let my drinking ruin many good things in my life and I’ve tried to find help twice before but the environment I was in was more of a “getting help for anything but physical harm is for losers” kind of environment. I’m afraid of what will come when I stop drinking (if I can actually do it this time) and I was wondering what sort of insight you folks might have for a dude who lives on his own and has no one close by or in the loop about my drinking. I’ve gone two weeks sober before and that was one of the worst physical experiences I’ve had. 

Any help or words of encouragement would be much appreciated. I don’t want to drink forever and I know I’ve got to stop.",2.50688034188034,3.9287924135802506,3.765061728395065,90.26431623931627,75.48148148148148,7.453751187084521,22.95536562203229,8.139509932561175,0.8977667616334282,609,17,142,10,13,199,98,162,0.155,0.7290000000000001,0.11599999999999999,-0.8402,0,0,5,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,0,1,2,8,0,1,5,0,19,8,0,0,0,25,28,12,0,3,5,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,1,7,8,6,2,4,6,0,2,2,5,0,4,9,0,12,3,20,14,5,14,0,2,0,0,8,5,0,7,7,85,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.13055465137018402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909782414042834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11009347876606368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22768199646109374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11524374607252533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6552907839872291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308671909147252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12227686967819948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06989702834421684,0.0,0.0,0.1122123301937107,0.10699991395313524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2690193637584446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13931626611066378,0.07352461900384732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368040067515248,0.18899230011479615,0.0,0.0,0.11813441611307443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13563677353111836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14192451493923613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834721037239057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12554795779398448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18131206524445545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22370014131649912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888066642101343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07801098394095393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908310870797114,0.0,0.13068829515275668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07890973237526289,0.0,0.10731408466886004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14508389234167252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503687271633443,0.0,0.0,0.08615301516584227
alcoholism,Slim_Reeper,2020/02/19,"High functioning alcoholic? I grew up around drinking. Saw the bad sides, and the good sides. I never drank till I turned 21. No drugs or anything. Married at 20 as soon as I graduated boot camp and got to my 1st duty station. Wife was 18. We had already been together for 4 years at that point. This was 2006. Being in the Marine Corps was an experience. Drinking was a part of the culture. Didn't help watching my parents drinking while growing up. So I Drank. Nothing bad ever happened, I was always a happy drunk, and a lot of the time emotional. Went through the occasional funny parts of it like peeing on things. Got that under control. Fast forward 14 years, now have a drink every night for 3 years straight. Sometimes 3 or 4 beers on work nights, 15-20 beers on weekends. I have never missed work due to a hangover because I don't get hangovers. The drinking does not mess with my home life because I'm not a mean drunk. Just my wife is concerned of my health because at 34 I have just recently been diagnosed with gout.

alcoholism,WordTherapyQ,2020/02/19,"Turmoil I'm almost 24 and have been drinking heavily almost every night for the last four years. I tried quitting two months ago, and then had an awfully long, solo 13-hour shift and ended up drinking for the following three nights after three or four weeks of sobriety. But now it's been a solid month without alcohol and I'm having a really difficult time. I feel like the physical ache to drink is gone, but I'm dealing with a lot of mental and emotional turmoil, lately. I feel psychologically restless and weak. I've lost all control over my emotions, and will periodically cry for no reason at all. I can't control it. In the daytime, I'm usually fine. I can go about my business, no problem. But when the sun goes down and I'm able to think, I just feel despair. I realize I haven't developed any interesting hobbies or past times. I would literally just scroll through my phone and drink a dozen beers (which is excessive anyway, but especially for being a 5-foot nothing female). I've been writing and journaling, reading and getting into spirituality and whatnot. But, god I just feel this sadness deep in my guts. And the sadness is starting to creep into daytime hours. When changing into my uniform at work today, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and starting tearing up, for no reason at all. Thankfully, I was able to stop it then, without full-on crying. I know it will get better with time and I know that a large part of it has to do with seasonal depression issues. I try to remember that alcohol won't solve my problems and how guilty and sick I would feel with myself the next day. I'm just sad, is all.",4.932320234113711,6.4609245480769255,6.001075808249722,76.19899665551841,69.5448717948718,8.631215161649946,32.15496098104793,9.085049710711278,2.9440979375696767,1297,58,230,25,23,431,176,312,0.21,0.721,0.069,-0.9938,0,0,7,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,6,10,18,0,3,16,1,22,10,1,5,4,65,46,29,0,4,13,0,5,1,0,5,4,0,0,0,9,24,7,3,12,6,0,4,8,13,0,6,8,5,24,5,37,32,6,49,0,6,0,0,3,14,0,5,32,158,33,2,0.18959472624466706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403214266235677,0.20261910291742924,0.1898517314325697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06446545766328231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08384056405570242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10028304050164896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2126466070501916,0.0,0.0,0.20826090409728285,0.0611364568237241,0.09773191884087963,0.08164882994932895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714613045072897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21326854827275327,0.08396232637830632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798708670073118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23966197568356445,0.06772325515600386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09905541922909067,0.0,0.05387552606851258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867126144017164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09894381797156368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10419630321362364,0.07727250338021363,0.10693555468449152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046313203221804065,0.0,0.0,0.08389268326421635,0.0,0.0,0.10348252011820597,0.08059332814082246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09553344544955132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1513327016492951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008180711332385,0.1779218070816349,0.0,0.09096062661490084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265630632588893,0.09049480964548898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18141654768907195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10082866451867596,0.0948230166350993,0.0,0.06072961824138004,0.19493495553658324,0.0,0.0,0.10738693277608496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341961230746759,0.0,0.0,0.07925484031520355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08727667553563781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060742322539035325,0.0,0.0,0.1658313143304984,0.0,0.08985681587524268,0.0,0.0,0.12872237379544155,0.0,0.09260324917491668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10440590260866696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07604072660794009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827625503962754,0.0,0.06901360938420448,0.0,0.0,0.134682653785769,0.0,0.0,0.06104639379714629
alcoholism,Peeps385,2020/02/19,"I feel so lost I need to vent.

My fiancé has relapsed, again for the 3rd time in the last year. He started a bender about 2 weeks ago. His vomit is coffee grounds now. I tried taking him to the ER earlier today and he threw a tantrum and made a scene in the ER lobby so we left (I also just started working at said hospital as well). He’s up almost all night, throwing a pity party for himself, on YouTube looking up depressing fkn music, randomly yelling (pretty sure our neighbors hate us). I don’t wanna leave him because I worry something will go terribly wrong if I leave and I’m not there for him. But I’m starting to get depressed and I feel like I’m losing my mind. He says he doesn’t want me to leave and we most definitely love each other very much. When he’s sober, he’s incredibly fun/funny, adventurous and smart. What’s worse is that I moved with him to be closer to his family. But I’m starting to wonder if I l’ve made a mistake. My lease back home is almost done and I’m pretty sure my landlord will hate me if I ask him to take me back as a resident. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. Not trying to sound pathetic or annoying. But I need a little help here.",1.5754543834640058,3.5078678319672143,3.539194583036352,88.58356735566645,79.69672131147541,6.2106913756236635,23.3136136849608,7.255503002510835,0.9117247327156096,917,31,193,12,23,310,147,244,0.187,0.695,0.11800000000000001,-0.9512,0,0,1,0,1,0,27.0,4,0,0,3,13,19,4,0,11,0,12,2,0,2,3,40,42,20,0,8,10,0,2,1,1,2,1,4,3,0,4,11,0,0,4,0,0,4,5,12,3,0,6,7,32,7,24,33,4,30,0,5,1,1,25,10,0,9,17,115,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09806595486980292,0.0,0.221557974564898,0.0,0.0,0.0884699905842151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10971426497760374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10342320369032536,0.0,0.0,0.17013378158426493,0.0,0.06743842625510217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19056923266030024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11321190120626007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10429119816761533,0.0,0.11187471720589864,0.07903339690444301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0577990990349988,0.0,0.06287302382911139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2184465153544204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741523028782344,0.0,0.1109699312872551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060798818433109185,0.09017742008089116,0.0,0.35142048877848303,0.12019875835446273,0.0,0.0,0.05404775307556188,0.11087934541134084,0.0,0.0,0.0929005175919451,0.1237655801323414,0.12076464821920373,0.0,0.0998470134738434,0.20935971495675126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11170377752677407,0.0,0.0,0.11758114473147215,0.08132506183433445,0.16406003915379522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10381784487947768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2250989786742394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523353568764457,0.0879766402689318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08516762757861797,0.0,0.0,0.31321517058112336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085330919013536,0.0,0.1663585163060922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06450867359361724,0.0,0.10486337931155876,0.0,0.0,0.15021969093515009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13307309457066965,0.0,0.0,0.0912805308711699,0.06525186469905818,0.0,0.08873993007370656,0.0,0.0994687786557822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11997245749193935,0.08053924711246667,0.11234914400954897,0.11274042683513308,0.0,0.1209554709916898,0.0,0.07124146438975575
alcoholism,maqnificunt,2020/02/19,"My sister is an alcoholic &amp; refuses to get help Back in 2012 my sister was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and multiple personality disorder. She’s attempted suicide more than once, self harmed, been put in a psych ward. She would drink underage but was mainly addicted to Vicodin. In her doctor records it says she’s not allowed to be put on narcotics again. After going to therapy for depression she started to improve and go out with the family &amp; her friends. As of right now she’s 26 years old who’s jobless and drinks every single day. There’s not a single day that goes by where she’s not drunk. It could be 9 pm and she’s pouring herself shots of vodka until she’s blackout drunk and then goes to bed. When she drinks she gets very aggressive and instigates fights whether it’s a verbal fight or a physical fight. She’s also started to self harm again &amp; refuses to get help for her depression &amp; her drinking habits. She doesn’t think she has a problem but I’m very concerned about her and her health, and I often think about what will happen to her when my parents pass away, idk if she’ll end up on the streets and homeless but I’m worried. I would love to get some advice if anyone else has been in this situation or is dealing with a familiar situation. I’m willing to go more into detail in the messages, I appreciate any help ❤️",4.479339622641511,6.040300660377362,5.385047169811318,80.0541745283019,70.69811320754717,8.771698113207547,30.608490566037737,9.255337874911486,2.7662867924528305,1085,46,203,23,20,355,152,265,0.157,0.736,0.107,-0.9087,3,0,6,0,3,1,27.0,0,0,0,1,12,12,4,0,10,0,17,13,0,1,0,36,33,23,1,6,11,3,0,0,1,5,6,1,1,3,7,14,7,2,2,7,0,6,4,10,0,0,4,1,28,2,36,21,6,36,0,3,0,1,42,14,0,6,16,134,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10609848820024842,0.0,0.0951047493057643,0.0,0.1040107015772792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07783067380043797,0.0,0.4218058804253059,0.0,0.06618425787612757,0.0,0.07445326913172194,0.0,0.0,0.06805182113419385,0.0997208439917475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914399313504568,0.07483682754727493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07770599970549859,0.0,0.0,0.1255329961415518,0.1003376808876316,0.2514773374390405,0.0987827076076541,0.0,0.0,0.11154274779034787,0.09961614179454854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3813653336167357,0.0,0.0,0.08130245131937404,0.0,0.08620095881311819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08200041154462599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09174923803245837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519296320789515,0.0,0.2033929377971397,0.0,0.16593592164450255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08606407264733378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10345179954931133,0.0,0.0,0.19570445273327056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783950675605902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10212609293753654,0.1036478240915217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10806776498679194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08498033387027074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09312676905177028,0.0,0.19567677752613705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08311491833761438,0.0,0.07739665332406405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20306215754722826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21879449256778466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13777410628094633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645762557237856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11129948569798426,0.0,0.0,0.12472371048435794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16060644238007662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09883814298411134,0.0,0.13827360904125918,0.0,0.0,0.06267403375279547
alcoholism,gayoops,2020/02/19,"I think for the first time tonight I realized I am capable of pacing myself while drinking. I did well (IMO), and am perfectly coherent and happy after drinking. However, since I am not out of it, I am tempted to drink mouthwash to fulfill the “pit if it” feeling I am used to. Does anyone have a way to talk themselves down once they have found their limit or once they know they should stop for that night? I really want to make tonight a positive experience since I paced myself so it could potentially be a turning point into healthy drinking habits.

alcoholism,FNSCARZ,2020/02/19,"How does one help someone who wont help themselves My father has been an alcoholic for as long as I have been alive. He says it runs in the family but everyone else has told me that he is the only one. We have tried several times to get him to stop drinking, but he refuses to do it. He acknowledges that he has a problem, he even calls himself a drunk but he doesn't care who he affects or what repercussions his actions have. We aren't allowed to attend most family functions anymore because he makes everyone uncomfortable. Most of the bars he will go to will only be for a few months at a time, because he drinks to the point where they have to cut him off every night. Not only that but he may possibly be the most racist and inconsiderate person I know. He speaks his mind freely and causes problems wherever he goes.

I have been lurking in the shadows for a while, hoping to see a post about a similar situation and anyone who might be able to help. My question to you reddit, how can I help my father get the help he needs when he doesn't want it? I feel bad saying this but after everything he has put me and my family through I'm not even sure I want to help him. I almost want to slowly distance myself from him to avoid the pain. I have said for a long time, the only thing he ever taught me was the reasons why I shouldn't have a family because I never want anyone to have to go through what I have, especially my own family. Either way I know it is a tough situation and I know deep down I do want to help him, but thank you for sitting through my rant and giving me a medium to get this off my chest. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",4.48564935064935,5.081355357142861,5.608030303030303,82.05818181818184,69.83333333333333,8.728138528138528,27.475108225108233,8.841846274778883,1.9199988095238096,1304,41,268,22,22,434,166,336,0.162,0.726,0.113,-0.9365,1,1,3,0,0,0,22.0,2,2,1,0,8,12,1,1,22,0,36,7,1,7,3,55,61,19,0,11,10,2,1,0,0,7,2,4,0,1,15,8,5,3,7,4,0,6,8,7,0,2,7,6,39,5,37,43,6,31,0,0,1,0,53,9,0,9,13,181,54,1,0.08382806397007664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08191581392200571,0.0,0.08958670664184447,0.08394169712727924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0570059580864518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313491418558196,0.117229062854895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06999293191444275,0.15330242919659762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0855978258528733,0.0,0.0854682980650897,0.0861145132002319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07335850368756842,0.0,0.0,0.16423917802682592,0.0,0.0,0.07002759086477199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11073529130187018,0.0758272831081687,0.0706287593695423,0.16020261499233718,0.07533925863153683,0.0,0.3951281910217464,0.0,0.04238598789477015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13139011064585246,0.08041551745605198,0.09528284114537366,0.0,0.0,0.09242073646607243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39331728981574027,0.0,0.0,0.08326018218410529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382091349940621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14837039739636573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055955883635610784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889283286331492,0.08464244791494868,0.0,0.06691076089453445,0.0,0.0,0.0621574472522701,0.06465337076994232,0.0,0.0,0.07866695936712771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11360813126694283,0.2550200803459093,0.08919897038212378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07319543205951225,0.0,0.0,0.07924461607652976,0.09450354672820177,0.08028411306619095,0.0,0.0,0.16042427198407105,0.0,0.08427035775655649,0.09390661660018243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08618921130557758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07973968526903569,0.13332688216225067,0.0,0.0,0.0668001137281218,0.0,0.0,0.09470185157642587,0.0,0.0,0.1884525123211277,0.0,0.0,0.07102724656949633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07008401505121474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790069582274102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07717761864805943,0.0,0.0,0.05569164084164902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14664245468515424,0.0,0.0,0.08010130749616859,0.0,0.05691375281704551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24721982019898525,0.06653881530424564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756417891117256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05954905149968906,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Throwawayokay222,2020/02/19,"Second Chance So, this past weekend I met up with a girl I grew up with. Recently moved to her area for work and hit her up to see if she wanted to grab dinner. She then invited me to an event and to join along a Sunday Funday type deal. Things were going great and I felt like I was crushing it... then I slipped and got caught up in the moment and had a drink, then another and proceeded to keep drinking. Everyone was pretty banged up but of course I got pretty banged up. We were really hitting it off and flirting then I ended up getting kicked out of this bar. Incredibly embarrassing and she was super cool about it. Had to go pick up my car the next day and of course she was walking out to her car as I was picking it up. She had to go to work so it was a brief, but good interaction I thought. I like the girl but I have no idea how to ask her out again after this relapse... and would have to explain that I am a recovering alcoholic. In your mid 20s I feel like its such a big thing to put on someone you're trying to date.

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you ever been in this predicament before? Does anyone have advice on how to go about this?",2.2220886075949373,3.832451240506334,3.619685654008439,90.21737658227848,76.67932489451476,6.5965400843881845,22.39852320675105,7.365786028017652,0.6682609282700418,892,25,196,11,20,293,132,237,0.034,0.823,0.14300000000000002,0.9767,0,0,3,0,0,0,26.0,1,2,0,3,9,9,0,1,10,1,18,5,0,4,1,34,37,23,0,3,4,0,3,3,0,1,1,0,0,2,14,17,5,1,5,4,0,12,1,1,0,1,18,5,27,8,45,16,0,51,0,0,1,0,19,21,0,1,21,141,41,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13659167003964254,0.0,0.14938260743172332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15145187296220086,0.16984833765070542,0.09505538240335493,0.14657180929394628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977376205269613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306756911078503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11894272139090616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09014671566467868,0.1441073290281587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12232266336063898,0.0,0.0,0.2738629153338092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238038374450414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12643926414715334,0.0,0.13356604591242902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07067710855365654,0.09985905863072027,0.13421098748661972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07302942610852503,0.0,0.3177614132128466,0.11724106547120515,0.22359011519566427,0.15410825011412435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15779491990310088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12424313372427713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20486874996996926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485643143974141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14865791157171912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334360919502202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2844135895654824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14051778709988502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08954682545334802,0.0,0.13801616144219855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11138678426182448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184353760616022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18572761144878935,0.0,0.0,0.11096992723244938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490163343680433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244602962751772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20352341451809086,0.0,0.0,0.09929589909664722,0.0,0.16984833765070542,0.0
alcoholism,trincea18,2020/02/19,"My mother is dying My mother has been abusing alcohol for well over 10 years now, and within the last year it has physically caught up with her. She is repeatedly being admitted to the hospital, nearly weekly, for throwing up blood and she is rapidly losing weight, unable to hold down a job, and refusing to get a liver transplant/get clean. I’m an only child and my mother is single, so all of this is falling on me for the most part. And up until now,  I’ve compartmentalized it and been so angry and resentful that I wasn’t fully feeling it. 

But my reality is that my mother is drinking herself to death and it’s extremely likely that she won’t survive through the end of the year. And if anyone has gone through this before, I could use any advice you have. I feel like I’m suffocating under all of this, and I don’t know what to do.

alcoholism,ouestdelalune,2020/02/20,"Am I an alcoholic? So today at around 9pm when I had 2 crates of beer delivered to my house after already drinking 5 magnums my son called me an alcoholic. He’s 11. I drink a lot. 
I work in a professional job. I don’t drink days before I work generally but can have a lot of days off sometimes and will drink maybe 1-3 days a week depending on my shifts. He said I couldn’t go a week without drinking. That might be true. I can’t remember a time in the past 10 years that I’ve gone a week without drinking. It’s worse when I’m on holiday and it wouldn’t be abnormal to drink every day when I’m off. Not always to excess but an average would be around 15 units a night. I’d be functional the next day after that. I could drink a lot more sometimes. It is also usual to have days off. Sometimes up to 6 consecutive days off drinking. 
I have historically got up and started drinking early in the morning but usually only on party weekends etc when I’m going a bit mad and everyone else is. I also come from a culture where excessive drinking is pretty much the norm. Everyone does it, everyone talks about it, no one ever says, your drinking is out of control etc. It’s basically a running joke that we’d all drink vodka through the eye. We’d have a gin in work at 9am if it were acceptable. 
I often crave a drink, particularly after difficult shifts or hard days. I feel relaxed when I drink but the day after I’m usually tired, irritable and ineffective. 
I’ve put on a lot of weight in the past few years, my house is a riot, I feel like my brain doesn’t work like it should and I’m permanently tired. 
As a teenager I had pretty serious mental health problems and alcohol was always a coping mechanism. It probably has been since I was around 13. I’m early 30s now. 
My only abstinent phase was when pregnant and breastfeeding and in the first few years of my sons life I probably only drank a few times a year.
I have thought for a while that my drinking is starting to affect my life in negative ways. Specifically I am not as efficient as I used to be, I am not as cognitively efficient either. I am tired all the time and have no energy to do anything. The things I do do, I do in a fugue of sleepiness or hungoverness generally. 
My anxiety has also been pretty terrible in the past year. It’s difficult to tell whether my job caused the escalation in my anxiety or my drinking and which caused the exacerbation of the other. 
I did see my GP around October last year and was signed off for stress and anxiety. They offered antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication which I declined as I have tried a number before and feel that they have been ineffective. I have tried a number of antidepressants and also found that when I came off beta blockers I was getting horrendous migraines. At that time in October I had symptoms close to PTSD due to an extremely stressful work environment. I couldn’t leave the house, everything made my heart pound. I suppose I’m a little better now but often things like going to the supermarket are just such a huge and scary task. 
I find it difficult to pick apart everything that’s going on in my life. I think I probably do have a problem with alcohol, that being a psychological one that goes back  20 years. I don’t know how to start addressing that. 
I have considered AA but have actually attended AA meetings before with friends and personally would describe them as a scary cult. I know that they help so many people and do so much excellent work and fill the gaps in the health service but I just don’t know that AA will ever be for me. I don’t believe in a God, I don’t believe in a higher power, I can’t commit to all that mantra stuff. Maybe I should go via health services for help? I just don’t know. Maybe I don’t really have a problem and I’m just being melodramatic?
Any insight much appreciated.",4.364882640295484,5.608952756225432,5.873312522340047,77.66270082211369,70.58584534731324,9.37608959847492,29.862242344811147,9.710602052930415,2.836813577981652,3055,122,591,73,55,1038,307,763,0.134,0.757,0.109,-0.9579,3,0,23,0,0,0,64.0,2,1,4,13,33,23,1,2,54,0,77,39,3,9,7,105,113,55,0,12,22,2,5,3,1,8,16,2,1,1,32,31,24,2,14,23,0,12,21,13,3,3,21,9,72,10,80,71,18,113,0,0,2,0,23,41,0,12,62,401,104,12,0.0,0.0,0.03773808269111869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1653135049300905,0.0,0.0,0.042675275255109266,0.12370324670352575,0.06435604440428322,0.0,0.0,0.02629813921736312,0.0,0.11833523557692202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031823583164770214,0.13770434654076455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029736214812705594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872051956269924,0.08713971547686086,0.0,0.03420205029979851,0.04221957220029225,0.0,0.0,0.043170500446850966,0.039488215206709434,0.04423021859060987,0.0,0.07945314955818193,0.0,0.03331231766371585,0.0,0.0,0.043373694060431775,0.030876272755136106,0.0,0.0,0.2244609128634348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03384193876414504,0.0,0.0,0.6440216385492299,0.0,0.0,0.03230531325910648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08625852312093174,0.0,0.0699616852199509,0.03258264590225876,0.11085764050307373,0.06951141173771305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05866084780989145,0.02762713020123331,0.0,0.0,0.03534530995791768,0.032894199696628185,0.0,0.04240161507696282,0.029877724372286783,0.0,0.020204411009747732,0.0,0.1098903301329856,0.0,0.03092935838231032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0346423225322576,0.0,0.0,0.12331889398502298,0.0,0.04582625021191122,0.051841763269145344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13386613961427504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07675155688902055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08501200448025911,0.03152266539673478,0.0,0.04094783546843603,0.0,0.0,0.08194507405362826,0.05667924079391482,0.03875928698864298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13150947128977936,0.0,0.03659217704508221,0.0,0.039207119177700034,0.11655301454238667,0.0,0.0,0.038957753880327635,0.038972062549671935,0.04102465154984891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528463257009017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04112788098296625,0.03629084956533777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052410003314944505,0.08823490299894307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11074978083315476,0.02681014577899364,0.033766710129788616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802932119032293,0.12508417157068824,0.11101102358677556,0.04520524600594239,0.03887582411680606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024774135064254358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043807592633901535,0.0,0.03678572231298399,0.030753354791462937,0.0,0.0,0.030816404978120056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031989699330210127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11474214956909838,0.0,0.08211626322770145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08859679577812121,0.0,0.04426994051213552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040194790715294616,0.0,0.03108291510078232,0.03380084372509156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051383629826060234,0.02477931767522941,0.0,0.030701076798746424,0.09019931291246502,0.13334258050217015,0.03665632943861085,0.0,0.0,0.0525112056776736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03340000489251265,0.12777451963151307,0.0,0.0,0.03069586209876082,0.09306051738452384,0.047091814646560606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745564394989029,0.0,0.16892111589046482,0.0,0.03940985169703291,0.05494265158128922,0.0,0.0,0.17432352684541688
alcoholism,miguelo10392,2020/02/20,"Worried about my dad Hi,

I´ve been noticing for the last 3-4 years, that my dad drinks too much and I´m really starting to get worried with him.

I´m only 17 years old , and it´s very hard for me to cope with this situation because it happens way too often. He is not the kind of person that drinks every day till he passes out, but it seems like nowadays everything is an excuse to drink , for example , every time we go to a restaurant he has to drink a entire bootle of wine and sometimes even more and this leads to very unconfortable moments , every time he goes out on the weekend with his friends he shows at home wasted.

At least once a week (work days) he shows at home a little tipsy and then he drinks again at dinner.

I think my dad can be considered as a functional alchoolic , he never had any trouble at work (at least that im aware of), but he frequently drives above the legal limit and I have no idea how to talk with him about this situation, I mean it shouldn´t even be my job, but my mum avoids this topic and he is not a very open person, which makes things even harder.",6.126527777777778,5.720982300925924,6.23462962962963,82.42333333333333,66.26851851851852,8.866666666666667,28.64814814814815,8.07648339933343,1.7028870370370377,851,23,173,9,12,271,130,216,0.062,0.877,0.061,0.2,1,1,6,0,0,0,22.0,1,0,0,4,10,5,0,1,11,0,10,7,0,3,1,31,18,14,0,0,5,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,12,15,7,2,4,9,0,4,4,2,0,0,2,1,13,3,30,14,4,33,0,0,0,0,24,11,0,2,18,103,25,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07303597441495692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06547030446404317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13852878295601898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5260576616443039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21281091066194172,0.0,0.2714684798973677,0.0,0.09652458007126244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0829773047741236,0.0,0.056112291192181564,0.0,0.061038138658455685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497384437976636,0.0,0.09620968849652113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2154627737085095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12124201114619153,0.116010892972437,0.0,0.1065783532994903,0.0,0.0,0.11184101923920801,0.0,0.08754568391238507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052470424444205487,0.1076434446348765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716906201169182,0.0,0.0,0.11699055233895618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07895167272602524,0.0,0.08283383161867215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12227609988893745,0.11269868319511404,0.11437795136545326,0.0,0.0816828656541373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18755582337842602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0688034647527809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09777331658548004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24144516345899966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10622177017899434,0.0,0.07601857620139796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08632439631105741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07135207252317614,0.06881785805412621,0.0,0.0,0.1252521073006556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2658498046129679,0.0,0.08524946120180034,0.0861501455871224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563775824130851,0.21814069731567345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13832470960749088
alcoholism,owahy,2020/02/20,"Looking for hope for friend Hi all
First post, sorry if this is a mess or doesn’t make sense my 32yr old friend (and ex) has finally submitted to hospital after six years of me trying 


He is an alcoholic (1L vodka a day most likely)
 (I am in long term recovery 5 yrs hi 👋🏼 ) 
and has been living in another country for the last 8 years (this is why I can’t be there and my only information is from his messages &amp; he tends to try and skew the facts to make it not alcohol related- he is in severe denial) 

I have driven myself insane reading medical journals and I need to know if any of you can take these facts and make sense, I need to know where we’re at as he is not honest and I think I need to book a flight tomorrow (or maybe I am just overreacting like he says...) 

(My assumption is late stage liver cirrhosis and possible failure ) but he is reticent to let me speak this and just tells me the doctors have diagnosed it as ‘spleen and liver infection not alcohol related at all but the alcohol doesn’t help!”



The facts 

Huge ascites on stomach - they diagnosed this visibly and then x ray but it hurt him a lot to lay on his back 


He has been vomiting blood and the other end for over a year and excretes puss 
Nose bleeds, shaking, stomach pain and difficult breathing and walking (although he has maintained his desk job throughout this until hospital - but barely) 

Severe Vitamin K deficiency &amp; malnutrition (he has not been able to eat or keep down much food for at least a year but the last time I saw him in person five years ago he barely ate once in seven days) 

Severely swollen liver and spleen
Pushing on his lungs and other organs 

Blood isn’t clotting and his muscles are wasted and his is severely underweight apart from the huge belly 

And the newest news “the doctors have said that my veins have created their own route to bypass my liver” 



He is an unreliable narrator and it hard being emotionally invested as he squeezes the few facts he gives me in between masses of dialogue which I know in my heart is bull - 
He is telling me the doctors say he will need to “cut down” bit not damaged enough to have to stop ...? Really?! 

He did not want Valium substitute while in hospital and said he doesn’t need a drink but they have forced this upon him (I am very glad they are doing this so as not to cold turkey him) 

The doctors have now performed blood tests and CT and ultrasound too and hoping to drain the fluid which is way more than they thought 

(He doesn’t like to give me information that backs up a diagnosis of anything alcohol related and just deflects so I hope I’m not crazy in thinking his litre a day of vodka and these symptoms match up with the probable sad truth) 



Has anyone got experience of a close person or themselves having had these symptoms and possibly what they mean- 
I’m being gaslit out of all proportion by my in denial &amp; addicted friend whom I dearly love and hope anyone could shed some light on these things and what they might mean for him as I sadly cannot fly out to be there nor does he want anyone to 



Not seeking medical advice obviously, he is in a safe place and with good doctors, I just need to know to be honest if this situation has any hope (from any experience) I just need help with trusting these facts and navigating the bull- so I know if I need to fly out ASAP",4.706450386769808,5.892680980061352,5.592734062416646,80.21074819951987,69.72085889570553,9.166497732728727,28.59109095758869,9.488314112642756,2.5036205921579087,2637,94,509,57,46,865,311,652,0.094,0.792,0.114,0.9627,1,0,8,0,0,0,50.0,0,1,7,3,16,29,1,1,29,0,57,43,14,3,10,116,100,59,0,20,28,1,2,3,3,2,24,5,0,2,27,39,9,3,12,5,1,4,17,9,0,4,12,12,52,20,77,79,14,70,0,4,2,1,64,34,0,17,32,332,79,10,0.058818337786872614,0.0,0.0,0.0641206701004276,0.0,0.05747659894747214,0.05213890755263765,0.3142945764770628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19118893325410355,0.0,0.11999545998545715,0.06167615563488257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12338144812515997,0.0,0.04840248035142092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904553422375753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0642143910473382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04696165663111242,0.0,0.0,0.11379888585856185,0.0,0.0,0.11939874947478388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.301015305356194,0.051472323767075966,0.0,0.0,0.057619578656072125,0.0,0.06018584357009683,0.0,0.06616271327840056,0.0520955890715845,0.060775066066607174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11507124141939976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0644326140278813,0.0,0.05003084807415206,0.07112336752474188,0.0,0.13632870560682728,0.0,0.0,0.11284781838036027,0.0,0.04933403111849395,0.04704239788557578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05268967755810198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0697000134766989,0.0788493839623839,0.0,0.0,0.2920994048991384,0.0,0.0,0.06296624711064441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058368124435063236,0.05228044116434697,0.0,0.0,0.16162510107621478,0.0958895913505401,0.06634964697005574,0.0,0.0,0.06014573545138496,0.0,0.08620700644099602,0.0,0.051937669867711006,0.05205237803623337,0.049392589964064336,0.0,0.0,0.0500052474227352,0.05308584627388079,0.0,0.1177850916138467,0.0,0.05909092602884551,0.12814082607297386,0.0,0.11850657463459564,0.0,0.06239696140702609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04323824599803672,0.3489044174761129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617199511979291,0.06263961012013793,0.0,0.04473399634272676,0.06258685840639014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027158076528948,0.06145264414223588,0.0,0.0,0.13261767647409956,0.05633170870953583,0.0,0.06341611633712795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05883425486441126,0.0,0.03768053331588685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11189941699828007,0.0935494060066702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2657919188997536,0.0,0.0,0.06611427606419244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06584231362416303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04917476410064877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12226954819973193,0.04422406998327296,0.0,0.10281963949781436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03907629006079154,0.07537683174688284,0.0,0.046695190130690574,0.03429744576806818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798675808403856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04853128862882381,0.06938515911456299,0.04668725876695052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05307440124544716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1893854054989567
alcoholism,Hardcore_EHS,2020/02/20,"Night terrors from drinking? Also a question on Naltrexone Okay, I don't think i've posted here before. You know how it goes. 

For the past few years, on an infrequent basis, i've been having insane night terrors, that seems to be the only thing it could be. People around me hear me banging on things, screaming, etc, while asleep. I'm completely unaware of it and not in control of it at all. 

I drink a LOT. Probably close to a liter of liquor per evening on a long night. 

I had severe sleeping issues prior to starting to drink, which is why I started in the first place, but I never did anything crazy in my sleep, which kind of leaves the booze as the primary suspect here. 

Anyone else ever experience anything like this? 

Also, I just got my first order of Naltrexone from a sketchy Indian pharmacy, which i'm excited about, but also a bit nervous. If I don't drink, or drink significantly less than normal, I have crazy muscle spasms, insane dreams, fairly typical withdrawl/DT type symptoms. 

If the Naltrexone works and gets me drinking way less, am I in danger of major seizures? I've got a limited amount of anti-spasm medication, which works on the days when I have the issues, but not enough for if it were to start being an everyday thing, and no easy route to get more. 

I really want to start fighting this, I just don't want to accidentally put myself in even more danger.",5.8348195187165794,6.6374285113636375,6.244500891265599,77.952192513369,66.91666666666667,8.93903743315508,29.923351158645268,9.007467420416297,2.4428434046345817,1093,38,199,18,17,353,158,264,0.13699999999999998,0.763,0.099,-0.858,0,0,6,0,2,0,39.0,0,1,0,6,14,11,3,3,17,1,16,13,3,2,3,32,32,17,0,7,11,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,15,5,8,2,5,8,0,1,7,7,0,2,6,2,19,4,34,22,12,37,0,0,0,0,4,14,0,7,20,139,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2218941427593268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06467159101693402,0.09476756875882207,0.15222379674050626,0.08233625967561964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07870270414565582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097580061636696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09697465386117854,0.0,0.10373609336124777,0.07384623289663758,0.0,0.0,0.0596487974185716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5436335679040083,0.0,0.0,0.07726404367683838,0.0,0.0,0.09556753328181933,0.10315148849449013,0.12217836252909307,0.08366305968284879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09047357251801566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15734494581063962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09664506158483972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14794639369570428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10424364913985212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19307235193635205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631474639900788,0.050830425126482684,0.0,0.0,0.0979342104727431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04518624435085882,0.0,0.0,0.08185128692289187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863221641092727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09317456770095434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07133446690562391,0.0,0.0,0.2603885401199836,0.09062116857917413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07034328320806688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829276095505266,0.06412134926030005,0.0,0.09663301077916517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08858044582000492,0.0,0.09972053015968917,0.0,0.0,0.0929786177413798,0.10361066026891703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059251858612479676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419998543986006,0.0,0.1044880725742536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18511482837374024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618613434769034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09613316671778338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843399716006199,0.05926425377105698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10910672636172927,0.07341474793556796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08345839726242299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13466854375130874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05956092593392319
alcoholism,OldKingOfSwords,2020/02/20,"My grandfather, uncle and great grandfather all died in their 60s from drinking and I am going down the same path... I am 39, been drinking since 17. I drink at least a 12 pack a day, some days a lot more than that. I am scared that it will eventually kill me like it did my relatives. I don't know how to stop. Everyday I tell my self that I won't drink, but then 2pm rolls around and the withdraws kick in and I can't help it. 

I am sick of feeling like shit with no energy or anything until I have a beer. Once I have one, I get shit done and feel good. I need to stop! I don't know what the point of this post is, sorry.

alcoholism,redbumblebee,2020/02/20,"Starting to Heal, I'm trying to save myself Hello All.
I'm in my mid 20s, a wife and mother of a PreK student. I work as a manager at a local food chain. I earned my Bachelors degree online about a year ago. I have been unable to find work in my field so I have decided to pursue my Masters degree. 
About two years ago my mom's dad, my grandpa, died of cancer. It was a hard loss for the entire family, completely devastating. My grandparents were married 52 years and everyone very much still depended on him. I was happy he got to meet my child but unfortunately my child was too young to remember him. Then about a year later my dad died of alcoholism. He abandoned our family when my parents got divorced and found someone new. His new girlfriend drank with him and they were drinking constantly. Everyone warned me about how rough he looked and everyone tried to warn him about his alcoholism. It didn't work he met his death just 8 months after getting remarried. My dad was an amazing man when I was growing up. He coached my softball team year round for years, he was so smart and funny. He listened to me and encouraged me. I have a hard relationship with my mom so he was always my go to. His loss was also very hard for myself and my siblings. Not to mention his entire family as well. 
Lately I have been drinking. I don't know if it is a way to cope. I feel like I'm in denial about these losses still. Rather than feel miserable about it all I just push everything down. Lately I have been hiding how much I've actually been drinking from my family. I know I need to stop. I know I need to make a change. It just feels so hard. I don't even know why I compulsively buy alcohol and drink it, it's almost like I'm in autopilot mode. Drinking doesn't make me feel better, I feel crummy. I'm always tired and sometimes hungover. I'm angry and anxious a lot of the time, I'm unsure what to do. I'm unsure how to make myself quit. Everything right now feels like a blur and despite being happily married with a great little family I feel alone and empty inside.

alcoholism,medic63,2020/02/20,"My experience with AA. I am an alcoholic I was absolutely unable to stop drinking. I was a daily blackout drunk
 20 to 30 drinks a day. I was truly hopeless and was suicidal. Today I have a life beyond my wildest dreams. I had to work the 12 steps, get a sponsor and work with others. I truly believe that if you are the real deal alcoholic who is hopeless u can recover in AA. If you are willing to do the work and then pass it on. If any one wants to talk or more info on my recovery let me know.😁",0.6127272727272732,2.6590298571428583,3.528917748917753,86.76350649350651,83.76190476190476,6.4848484848484835,23.831168831168828,7.686295010490155,1.3101428571428575,385,15,82,7,11,137,71,105,0.142,0.779,0.079,-0.7823,0,0,4,0,0,2,10.0,0,2,0,3,1,2,0,0,8,0,14,6,0,0,0,13,16,8,1,4,4,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,4,5,5,1,1,4,0,2,0,2,2,1,5,0,13,0,11,9,1,10,0,2,0,0,5,4,0,4,4,60,17,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4274215458402591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359887847246496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22530156812627586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12896631416555654,0.20616381786038512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3917956468720689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19561237915931287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10447785969126143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990016328459527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044863731860035,0.14124714227394014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13550716648249592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22761353463204514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671867354809676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21873846728560747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16073106219865368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18955142231249128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179495057612106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4367490998965689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,wardquestion,2020/02/20,"ADHD medication “cured” my alcoholism? This is in a way a success story but not one born out of my own willpower. For nearly the past 2 years I struggled a lot with drinking. As a girl with not much weight I was drinking 0,35-0,6 liters of vodka a night mixed with cola and other things. 

Well, last month I finally got a long overdue diagnosis for ADHD and got a prescription for Methylphenidate. I lied about my alcohol use because it would have probably denied a medication based treatment (or so was my assumption)

Well it’s 1 month later and with the exception of 3 ciders spread over the month I pretty much lost the need to drink. I walk past the liquor section and the rising urge is as easily crushed as it comes up.

I assume the withdrawals were asked because I replaced it with a different chemical sensation? I just wanted to share this with people who might understand. 


I can’t offer any wise words because I feel like I cheated my way to this... but I want to say to everyone here that I believe in you with all my heart and wish you all the best. For your loved ones, your health and your mental wellbeing.

alcoholism,DefinitelyNotACad,2020/02/20,"Husbands (recovering) employee showed up dead drunk at work. I'll keep it short: My husband is sober since a couple of months and is slowly opening up. He does take his sobriety surprisingly well.

Recently one of his employees (known to have a drinking problem, but functional until now) showed up reeking af of alcohol. My Husband didn't send him home right away, only after he witnessed him slurring at a customer some time later. After consulting HR they chewed him out for not telling the employee a reason and not firing him immediately.  
He is really torn between his responsibilty as a boss and his empathy for his employees struggle.

There is no question to what he is supposed to do as this is already been settled with HR, but more about how he can cope with this situation.",7.289029733959314,8.327793943661971,7.598544600938965,68.68675273865415,63.78873239436618,10.81815336463224,38.312989045383404,10.746095033038511,4.540297965571205,628,32,101,16,9,205,100,142,0.126,0.836,0.038,-0.9214,6,0,2,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,1,5,5,0,1,6,0,11,4,0,3,0,19,13,9,1,1,4,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,7,4,1,3,4,0,1,4,3,1,1,2,2,12,2,24,11,2,19,0,0,0,0,22,10,0,2,8,72,16,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23290983914399066,0.0,0.0,0.24050041160996105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20476027350271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24114466208753715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19071933698849527,0.0,0.0,0.21349663342519812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21860995556759685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19371363767159325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17395632835629798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14768068037492618,0.16575195170783882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085375876801654,0.0,0.0,0.24414085288730705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13961690099516352,0.22407694281456164,0.2151878489299085,0.0,0.0,0.1861181779078436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802808724771688,0.2449718600912009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278365047021663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638625321116287,0.0,0.19048774214233652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12708161665451906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1959527687371026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15866172960968716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,-brena,2020/02/20,"What do I do to not lose my social contacts when trying to get better? I (19F) am a psychologically addicted alcoholic. Drink about 2-4 times a week (mostly on the weekends). I always lose control and end up with having a massive blackout. My friends and family have started to confront me but I'd always push them away or even shout at them when I'm drunk. Recently I also got confronted with my genetic predestined risk of alcoholism (my father and his side of the family). I got told that my dad had very similar habits and that he also struggled with other addictions like gambling and other drugs. 

I want to gain control about my drinking habits and get healthier, but I can't go out with my friends without drinking too much. Also, I love to socialize and meet new people or old friends while being out, so I think just staying home isn't quite an option.

alcoholism,alirres,2020/02/20,"My exes drunk words hurt...am I the problem? I’ve been in my head the past 72 hours just thinking about the encounter I had with my toxic-on-again-off-again-ex boyfriend since 2016 (we’re 25F &amp; 25M). We ended up seeing each other while walking to the same bar... it didn’t end nicely. We argued on the way there, he talked poorly about me to his friends that were there (who are also all my friends) as the night went on. Eventually I had enough and I left with a few of mine, and he follows us out. Walking directly behind us. He texts me off an app, and I immediately call an Uber home. He calls me in my Uber, berating me about how I’m an alcoholic - and he doesn’t care I got in a car accident a few days prior, as he said “I don’t give two f*cks” - I’m a b*tch, I’m a loser who is only friends with weirdos and nerds, I’m insane, that he can make all of the people there not want to be friends with me if he tells them all the shit that’s happened with our breakups... and goes on and on and on telling me all of these things while he’s drunk - when not a week and a half ago we were together and things were fine. 

Since then, I have cut contact with him as the encounter really effected my mental health. I did wreck my car mid last week because I fell asleep at the wheel. (No legal trouble to report currently.) I understand where I went wrong here, and I admit my faults. However the words that he said that say have stuck with me. What if I really am the problem? I don’t drink daily though? I don’t  drink from day in to day out when I do though? II’ll have a beer or two in social settings, maybe a shot if it’s a Friday or Saturday, but I don’t blackout every time I drink. I have my moments sure but who doesn’t? 

Thinking about this has actually gotten me kind of down. I had even asked my close friends their thoughts on the matter. All except one said we’ve all at some point have worried about your drinking, but we know you’re not an alcoholic, you just need to work on moderation when you do go out. Then there was one friend who told me she does not think I have a healthy relationship, and I may never with alcohol. She said I had made her uncomfortable too whenever she came in town and I was trying to get her to drink, and enticing others to encourage her to drink, whenever she was insistent on staying sober. I appreciated her honesty, apologized, and thanked her for being so blunt. However I have been sitting here wondering still.... am I really the problem? Was my drunk toxic ex just spouting cruel things to throw at me because he was angry I was there? 

It’s one thing to not acknowledge or make excuses for my actions. I know where I went wrong, and I’m from here on out actively working on moderation and being more responsible with drinking. However, His words cut deep, so deep that when we were on the phone that night I really lost all sense of myself and my place here - I didnt want to be here.",3.2070519262981563,4.444409370184252,4.2895276381909575,87.93817755443888,73.38860971524288,7.785728643216081,25.32696817420436,8.309216665352881,1.3789153098827471,2282,72,498,37,45,744,269,597,0.109,0.7979999999999999,0.09300000000000001,-0.556,4,0,11,0,0,0,83.0,8,3,2,5,33,28,5,0,30,0,45,19,3,5,9,94,87,44,0,9,18,1,0,0,6,1,4,5,1,0,23,39,15,0,11,12,1,13,15,15,0,6,34,6,83,13,68,48,14,82,0,2,1,0,69,37,1,9,28,335,106,4,0.0,0.0,0.06506475438847198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0591029761163387,0.2137644885819504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05331962297673678,0.0,0.0722418598460125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062331714871893526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0812883880357975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13616436450643168,0.07625793638487438,0.06797915937422477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12899872952217775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05834735833670233,0.0,0.0,0.4572098110022129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11810774337977822,0.06889264556564102,0.0,0.044037919241285285,0.0,0.05617619396058871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30907560628565817,0.0,0.0348347066456122,0.06396031512342218,0.03789268998264977,0.0,0.05332573790272737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058960094797129964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06842733601081495,0.07087194134253001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0668800217895188,0.0,0.06566101279806583,0.0,0.07137649739513252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06943129594905803,0.07328519094163566,0.05434866679623923,0.0,0.0,0.07244210647486304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278316036257229,0.0,0.0,0.06308908249167809,0.08901157546611946,0.0,0.0669835589909385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06719227626270813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04943834273895465,0.051423532410854976,0.0,0.0,0.12513911916746032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13554122586579054,0.05070900871414229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06364841361501881,0.046223746036782025,0.0,0.06966072611624344,0.0,0.06302901201698355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19139565311796472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17085372633643545,0.0,0.0,0.07158352710713377,0.0,0.0,0.25369110634336633,0.05302228765848194,0.0,0.0,0.05313099336413662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0684404795409699,0.11030777302160223,0.0,0.0,0.06796631922206317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07106621153824813,0.05324639117466312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0628399854285574,0.0,0.0,0.053590487181429634,0.11655301161411563,0.06138497848879644,0.0,0.0,0.17718246481067665,0.1281671009877898,0.13101483687210153,0.0529321544425509,0.038878473163924364,0.0,0.0,0.06371040106846329,0.0,0.045267650824036686,0.0,0.1302627173573718,0.06941057023087563,0.1604025768286159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865276804728369,0.052923163705619454,0.10696462344500876,0.0,0.0,0.18542396029694672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07230571811775599,0.09707975015051386,0.06771125396069695,0.0,0.0,0.14579633314443266,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,mydadlife,2020/02/20,"New Alcohol Belief System - Feeling Trapped I stopped drinking alcohol in April of last year. So I’m not an entire year yet but getting close.

I’ve started to think that I might reintroduce alcohol to my life but I’ve been struggling with establishing what my new values or belief system with alcohol is.

Brief background: 
I was drinking alcohol once a night. A can or two of beer. Maybe a glass of bourbon. It was every night.

I had convinced myself that I liked the taste and I drank it instead of pop. I had been into logging new craft beers on untappd and then start trading and selling bourbon. It became a full blown hobby.

Those around me and the culture led me to believe that everything about this was ok.

My problem was that but then also on occasion if I had drank to much and conflict was introduced - I would tend to get angry and would not be able to control the anger.

So I stopped cold - I tried to drink some on an anniversary trip soon after that ... but that was a bad decision. So I’ve been sober since.

However I do love beer and bourbon and that had become a part of me. The breweries, the bourbon trails, the tastings... it was fun and I want to say I could do that again someday.

Today:
I’m trying to define rules with alcohol and reasons when it’s ok and when too much is too much.

We’ve also been looking at was to better manage our budget so not buying alcohol has significantly helped with that.

I’m struggling because over the course of the year I’ve developed a ton of new beliefs..

1. There is no real reason to drink alcohol. Ever.
2. There is no real reason to spend money on material and luxury things. Like alcohol. Ever.
3. Everyone who does these things around me makes me judge them like I was once judged.
4. I shouldn’t spend money on myself unless I absolutely need something

As you can see I feel like I’m on a slippery slope to not having any luxuries in my life at all - because I am guilting myself out of having anything because there may not be a real reason to obtain these things. Ever.

As a Catholic I am starting to believe that I am actually on the better course, too. However culture suggests that I am not living or enjoying life. My wife suggests I am judging her now and that what she is doing is not wrong in her eyes but drinking wine to “relax” would be the wrong reason to drink alcohol per my new beliefs. Mind you she only drinks once every month or two... but I still wonder why she does at all. When I ask her about my new found beliefs she feels attacked by me... 

Should I just ignore the culture around me and continue to feel trapped in my own judgement?

alcoholism,lamscake,2020/02/20,"don't need alcohol to function, but need it to socialize I refuse to drink alone and let myself get to that point, like i often think about it but something in my brain just tells me its wrong. when i'm hanging out with guys i *need* alcohol to be even vaguely funny and not socially awkward. it works for the first 3 or 4 shots but then i cant get myself to stop and end up drinking half a handle and embarrassing myself but i don't drink constantly. maybe like once a week. if i really feel like i need a drink, since i refuse to drink alone ill hang out with random guys for the sole reason of getting drunk and not feeling lonely. for some reason this fucked up logic makes sense to me, like somehow its better than drinking alone because i'm actually with someone and doing things. Like ill enjoy their company but the deciding factor to if i actually want to go out is if i'm able to get drunk or not. Then there's my friends, i love hanging out with them sober but a lot of the time there's this thought that's like ""if i was drunk right now id be having so much more fun"" everything just feels so mundane and boring without alcohol and i'm not sure what to do.",3.4182612738261287,4.703008903765691,4.400048814504881,87.16558693630869,72.93305439330544,7.4868433286843326,25.4116689911669,7.984000788550335,1.3170109716410972,924,29,194,13,18,300,130,239,0.192,0.625,0.183,-0.0906,0,5,10,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,2,3,12,18,1,2,8,0,11,17,1,3,1,59,33,25,0,9,19,0,3,6,1,0,5,0,0,2,11,16,12,3,9,9,0,4,8,6,0,2,2,3,20,12,31,28,4,23,0,1,0,2,11,9,1,11,16,124,31,1,0.09060305837185413,0.0,0.1768310306452677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29048134574993645,0.0,0.281512332061517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05523078343629823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08013104235046359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10114297737342673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09790971877380353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5325390255590887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08024741730498776,0.0,0.0,0.05984246555681515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08142818674569358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137434885890341,0.06472684300419966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07706691516650531,0.0,0.0,0.06999969814749071,0.08376106750654695,0.1893454339838575,0.0,0.05149180602102425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17942254476136205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09264776573023373,0.0,0.2655844666994171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07702748023172215,0.0817727975601711,0.0,0.06047824500749099,0.0,0.09102295001327458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06660367282482167,0.2687240790221831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09648930020208243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564917565792654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05804263921691169,0.1863100678486581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737451680286306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.074947786151369,0.0,0.0,0.18471681619583769,0.07676767734043458,0.06975066079959229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07574821373526835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08539231027232018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791910665084505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06019264607854272,0.058054781413531126,0.0,0.07192870788742388,0.05283137194712295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05344003127201763,0.0,0.07267630833366799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08733811509278963,0.0,0.06596010557192701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09906022122323843,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,timeformakingcoffee,2020/02/20,"2 years sober today. If I can do it, you can do it. 2 years ago today, I was in the pit of utter demoralization. I found myself in the ER after a particularly bad day, and my SO was threatening to throw me out because of my foolishness. Drinking was ruining my life. 

Since then, I’ve repaired relationships, rebuilt my career, and regained my physical health. A decade or more of bad behavior has been virtually reversed since I decided to get my shit together with the help of the folks in a certain fellowship. I’m grateful for 2 years, and I’m grateful for everyone who has supported me along the way.",4.382289272030654,6.0819839913793095,6.221149425287358,73.41657088122608,71.15517241379311,9.983141762452108,32.71647509578544,10.25414643259724,3.7345049808429103,477,23,87,14,9,165,74,116,0.162,0.733,0.10400000000000001,-0.8504,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,1,0,0,1,6,1,0,8,0,10,4,1,0,1,11,15,7,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,6,1,0,2,1,0,1,0,4,1,0,5,0,14,2,15,10,1,15,0,1,0,0,4,4,1,2,9,58,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810370976474459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3410461441272745,0.12449638587972835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13171110902511154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20006712409601132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19515000524991893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2239270662984634,0.0,0.0,0.10670146586372094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217086370406054,0.0,0.0,0.13689070498291356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14425331045474632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21926601397083026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20963861030123945,0.3378814467223345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23175717591819436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3871713045627733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16210784270366654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39455123735036457
alcoholism,SuchOcelot,2020/02/20,"Giving it up Hello, I have always drank since being a teenager but in the past 5 years I can say I am an alcoholic.
I am away to turn 30 this year and know if I don’t quit soon my health will start to deteriorate.
The worst thing Is I am a high functioning alcoholic which makes it hard for me to come out and say to everyone that I have a problem that needs addressing.
My partner of 10 years knows I struggle with alcohol but not to the extent that I truly drink.
I was drunk last night and said today would be my last day drinking until I am 30 in May 23rd, but I know if I make it to my 30th then I should continue sobriety.
I bought l-glutamine and milk thistle for cravings and recovery, but would like to know if  anyone knows other supplements or techniques that will keep the cravings at bey?

alcoholism,LordeKimboat,2020/02/21,"Trying to taper vs cold turkey. Last night I tried to start tapering after realizing I was having withdrawal symptoms during the work day after drinking 10-12 stronger beers (in the 7-10% range) almost every night for the last 2 years. 

I ended up drinking more than I usually do. 

Today I am once again having withdrawals. And my anxiety is causing a panic attack. I’m sweating and feel nauseous and I can’t focus at work. 

I am considering trying to go cold turkey this weekend.  But I’m afraid.

alcoholism,Global-Volume,2020/02/21,"Weird thing with alcohol I'm a 30yo male. I never imbibed alcohol after a nasty event in my early 20's that just so happened to take place when I was drunk for the first time.

My life overall hasn't gone great. I'm lucky in some ways but not others. Bojack Horseman is a close enough parallel to my life of all things that if my life was made into a TV show critics would call it a copy.

I just want to get my strange experience with alcohol out there and see if any one else shares this mindset.

Last year on a whim I started drinking spirits. There's a spirit I like that when mixed with a fruit mix is barely tolerable as otherwise I completely hate the taste. When I have this drink(s) it's equivalent to 6 units of alcohol. I started having this in November 2019 once every 3 nights. In December it became once ever 2 nights. Towards Xmas and new years it was every night. I was getting real depressed because I worried about being addicted. I didn't even like the effect. I don't know why I did it. I'd imagine my evening ahead of me and I'd always put that drink in my plans. The thought of having it was better than having it.

So mid-January rolls round and all the celebrations are over. I just stopped putting drink into my evening plans. I find I'm okay that night. Huh? Night two comes around and I'm still fine. Day 3? Fine again. Day 4? Well I'm still fine so I guess I wasn't addicted after all. In that case let's have the drink again!

That's been my pattern ever since mid Jan. There's no urge to drink. No urge to buy any. I've had none now for days. I wrote this post because I thought I might get some more tonight? But then I realize that hey there's no point because it just makes me sway a bit and feel tired. If I wanted to feel tired I could just have a Phenergan! If I wanted to sway and feel woozy I could just have a Phenergan and \*fight it\*.

I genuinely don't understand any of this. After months of alcohol ... even just a bit ... I'm supposed to be hooked? At least mildly but theres no physical or mental symptoms.

But then I wonder is that thought where I go ""lets include alcohol in my evening plans"" the addiction for me? Because it sometimes appears. It always feels good to think that, but the reality is that it does little for me. In-case you're wondering evening plans are things like watching a TV show or film with friends or family, going for evening constitutionals around the city or beach, going to an art class. I'm never alone when I drink. I did a few times earlier having my drink with lunch on lazy lazy days.

alcoholism,clanurdnot73,2020/02/21,"[NY] How can my family help my cousin who is dealing with alcoholism? Hello,

My family is going through a very rough situation right now. I have a cousin, let's call him Rick, who is al alcoholic. He had managed to get sober for the last two years, but after his last relationship ended about two months ago, he started heavily drinking again. The situation is worse that it has ever been before, to the point where he isn't going to work or paying any of his bills, or his rent. My aunt, his mother, lives in the same building as him, and she along with my other cousin, Sergio (Rick's brother), have been the ones that have been helping Rick the most. It has gotten to the point where Rick has gone to my aunt's apartment and started taking money from her, and even shoved her at one point so he could get her purse. 

We want to know what we can do to get Rick help. An order of protection has been discussed by us, but my aunt is unwilling to go through that process because she wants to be able to help her son. Are there any city/state resources or legal resources we can use in this situation?

alcoholism,Avocado75,2020/02/21,"Hi, I’m new to this sub... I’m a 44 year old female. I haven’t drank any alcohol in about a year and a half. I finally admitted to myself that I just can’t handle it. If I start drinking, that part of my brain that tells me to quit just becomes nonexistent. I will drink till I pass out.
I’ve lied to myself over and over that I could be responsible till finally I realized that I just couldn’t even let myself have that first drink. It will always lead to too many embarrassing moments - moments I won’t even be able to remember.
My problem now is, I replaced my drinking with anything that might take the edge off the cravings- except for illegal drugs. But Kratom, yes (it’s legal in my state) and an overuse of Kava tinctures. - To the point that it just feels absolutely stupid and spending way too much.
I guess I’m wondering...is there anyone that had similar experiences?
Anyone been able to train their psychological thinking to finally be satisfied mentally after ridding their self of this stuff?",4.051353626943005,6.027407227979275,5.010748056994816,80.62265058290157,72.57512953367878,8.555569948186529,28.64281088082901,9.188382445141503,2.555528756476683,797,32,150,18,16,260,116,193,0.084,0.858,0.057999999999999996,-0.7816,0,0,6,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,2,3,11,3,1,1,7,1,16,8,1,1,0,24,26,8,0,4,7,0,1,0,0,4,2,0,0,1,16,6,6,0,5,4,1,2,4,3,0,2,3,1,22,0,25,13,2,26,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,3,15,106,38,2,0.2509016395608695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13406877431477476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043851317129623,0.0,0.0,0.08531085934260951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17543626013465288,0.0,0.10323533557671104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13855057427714726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14004460395204513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001622715685653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4915761750357226,0.1454831229459997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16571816662023475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12271497387025672,0.0,0.0,0.0634317038563671,0.0,0.0,0.4122757232455189,0.0,0.1067084032186568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13819822143862934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12828196277857762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12718744097260407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12642491999096692,0.1330834949583803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09222078709494616,0.0,0.0,0.12116118347748182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316395322602386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13585101272906774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11859157398094193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12003949202659095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13343238888312828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14211132363546142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13087256483816292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08879473593241755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14361117480292848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09432340392773102,0.0,0.10964954595680873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08038381983321542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09957702148669724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1615724297438186
alcoholism,FitnessViking89,2020/02/21,"Day 2 off sobriety. Hi! 

Yesterday i startet my journey to a life without alcohol.

I have been abusing alcohol for on and off periods for about 10 years.

2 days ago I went to the step of calling my parents late t nigjt and told me to come and gett me (a 2 hour drive).
The first thing they saw when opening the door was me on the couch and about 100 cans of beer around the room...

I have been throu this days before, and failed again, usualy after a long periode of not thouching anything.

Im extremely lucky to have a great supporting family, and a great boss thats realy wants to help.

Wish me good luck!",3.5314663023679422,4.716608303278691,4.3983060109289625,87.67283242258655,72.52459016393442,8.373041894353369,27.489981785063755,8.841846274778883,1.919111839708561,471,17,101,9,9,152,83,122,0.048,0.752,0.2,0.9627,1,0,3,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,2,5,7,0,0,10,0,7,4,0,1,0,16,14,7,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,3,9,3,0,0,1,0,5,2,1,0,1,6,1,11,6,19,8,0,27,0,1,1,0,6,7,0,2,15,60,14,2,0.0,0.2015837314868065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15081559210532533,0.363647992425056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14000770396265486,0.15145740569994526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14477348665621967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737282164629088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14655738436564972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.329171575648349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16038939124087412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14471787634248395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14270228248581346,0.0,0.37515181140317055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11403879643452065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675500148060749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837764331582175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19192119212827732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12017232220411048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15056529916932693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18891626143926665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19306869235623564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11303101847402593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16257255542418986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10035081617907476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577180834777378,0.0,0.0,0.19564838431213252,0.16400535187734192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10956221910709116

alcoholism,cocothunda69,2020/02/21,Big steps I guess I made a decision today to see a counselor about my drinking problems. A lot of my friends have been making subtle comments about my drinking and how it’s been a problem. I went to a counselor today to talk about everything and she gave me a recommendation of a few therapists to talk to. I want to live a life where I’m happy and I hope these steps can take me there!,2.4566546112115724,4.352657341772152,3.8975045207956636,87.22050632911396,76.84810126582278,6.53960216998192,26.475587703435806,7.447530270364453,1.3541233273056057,306,12,63,4,7,101,48,79,0.07200000000000001,0.777,0.151,0.7088,0,0,2,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,0,8,0,4,3,0,3,0,13,14,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,3,2,0,1,2,0,3,0,2,0,0,5,1,11,3,11,9,2,7,0,0,1,0,6,2,0,3,2,44,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38787381272591576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17792420690625393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15295245140931665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2180881571709459,0.0,0.0,0.21074456567304292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19663057682088791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13983327290086525,0.0,0.0,0.174812646200824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16830846759511225,0.0,0.1873256179657526,0.13214765314185298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3788643780114241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.157757820719362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488500874074175,0.3182443215804018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2298604130064547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37530806412442347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11676884333448576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18352175778783106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,mack9419,2020/02/21,"I’ve drank almost every night for the past 3 years I’m a 25 year old male. I turned to booze towards the end of college as my sleep issues worsened. It helped enough that it made me fall asleep once I finally felt tired, but also pushed me to stay up later and later since I felt so good at that point in the night. 

This cycle continued after I graduated almost 3 years ago. It’s become a part of my life. 3 hours before bed it’s time to crack open the vodka and enjoy my night. By the time I get to bed I can finally pass out. If I don’t drink I’m awake all night with fragmented sleep. 

As time passed however, the drinking became less affective at helping me sleep. In addition, I’ve gained about 90 pounds in the past 3 years as a result of drinking.

Fast forward to today, I developed a weird feeling in my chest. I work EMS, so at first I figured i pulled a muscle lifting a patient. But it didn’t feel muscular. I decided to go to an urgent care to ease my mind. A half hour later I’m in the ER because the EKG came back normal. Long story short, I was released 8 hours later and told to follow up with a cardiologist. My heart rate is higher than it should be which could be for a myriad of reasons. 

I’ve taken this as a wake up call. I’ve beat the crap out of my body these past 3 years with booze. I’m now terrified of the health consequences I’ve subjected myself to, and can only hope that whatever damage has been done can be reversed with a healthier lifestyle. 

I know that quitting this habit is going to be hard. While I’ve never felt that I couldn’t survive a night without booze, it’s certainly been hell on the rare nights that I’ve had to abstain from it over the years I started tonight, and I’m already feeling incredibly down and having some cravings even though I should be happy that I’m taking control of my health.",4.209920634920636,4.812904468253969,5.290926984126988,84.05962857142858,70.45502645502646,8.164402116402115,27.024761904761906,8.238735603445708,1.6256830476190474,1451,45,300,20,25,480,205,378,0.08,0.8190000000000001,0.10099999999999999,0.8254,1,0,4,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,7,9,10,2,0,26,0,23,21,10,5,3,47,50,18,0,7,4,0,7,0,0,2,4,0,2,1,20,15,7,2,10,4,0,10,5,4,1,2,14,7,29,6,52,27,5,73,1,1,0,0,5,21,2,5,43,175,49,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07091069067545418,0.0,0.1602067610712615,0.0,0.08827640920489199,0.06397192730858105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061511173655445686,0.0,0.048764174989821205,0.08834813006447016,0.06806980489866532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885634851077345,0.0,0.0,0.08168378114774964,0.09149290431487113,0.08156017614535094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897211310933035,0.06386945303013429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08186260071474814,0.0,0.23509377031763495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085177606533526,0.08265616049355554,0.0,0.05283590564310251,0.0,0.06739918993964854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12134354083520282,0.0,0.2304230715416411,0.17526110067148432,0.0,0.06804365796186237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04179405623931574,0.0,0.09092593959842077,0.06709596316119554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08515610471325807,0.07165975664795025,0.0,0.0,0.1700617681321731,0.0,0.0947943930495941,0.10723784863466834,0.0,0.0,0.07945302853296628,0.236336716384416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08349393753555898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04396312882556622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05650279423108665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0707930075850318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07569314960992073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08077208880489786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061697031855850674,0.0,0.0,0.4504190120586579,0.07837805996420685,0.0,0.0,0.08394123646495677,0.08519200393249211,0.0,0.06083975914020703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08662672821528196,0.22909267517868395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07562107813180417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08508446904217555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08224812491946751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06617264379746432,0.0,0.2401581442728472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05662083264631727,0.08526396596248566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06014624191785281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07859462570078947,0.0,0.1399370843373921,0.0919424196679048,0.0758258527479498,0.07643859649439919,0.0,0.0,0.08701152725618687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07711227077881534,0.0,0.05823727150577805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3090847247435877

alcoholism,EventuallyHere9,2020/02/21,"Still trying to understand what it means If anyone who has dealt with alcoholism wants to share their thoughts on this, I would appreciate it.  My alcoholic husband and I are separated and headed for divorce.  I keep trying to figure out how we got here, because I just don’t understand his behavior.  I guess maybe there’s no explanation for the way an alcoholic acts, but I thought I would ask and see if I could get some closure.  For the last five or so years of our marriage, when he would get drunk, he would get angrier and angrier at me. He would scream at me and curse at me and make fun of me and threaten to hurt me. Towards the end, he would threaten to kill me when he got drunk and we got separated when he actually pushed me down one time.  There was no particular reason, I never did anything to make him angry. When he was sober, he never acted like that, and he would say how much he loved me.  Now that we are separated, he talks about how much he loves me and wants to get back together, but I will never do that, because I honestly think he is one drinking binge away from actually killing me. But I just don’t understand how someone can act so differently when he’s drunk and when he’s sober. What does he actually think, does he love me or does he hate me? Why would he say all those horrible things when he was drunk if he didn’t mean them?

alcoholism,duanxiu,2020/02/21,"Just wanting to introduce myself and maybe meet people with similar experiences. Hi! This is gonna be long so I apologise.

I am 25 years old and I am concerned that I may be or might become an alcoholic.

My dad died 3 months ago, 3 days after my 25th birthday. He is my bio dad who has always been in my life but I have only seen a few times a year but had a close relationship with... I’ve always said “he’s not my father he’s my best friend.” I have a brilliant step dad who has been my dad since I was 3yo. I got a call on my birthday when I was in South Korea and I was told that my dad would probably die that night, they had given him 9 months last January so I was prepared. I was due to fly home 3 days later on a trip that had been planned for months. They managed to get him on the phone and we told each other “I love you”. He managed to hold on until I flew home, travelled a few hours to get to him, held his hand and he died that night like he was waiting for me.

My dad died from stomach cancer due to alcoholism and smoking. 

On top of that, my 15 year old cat who has slept by my side since she was 8 weeks old... I just had to put her to sleep.... so you can all imagine this has all been even harder for me on the drinking front.

I have been drinking heavily for a few years now, I only allow myself 3 nights a week but I will drink almost 70cl of spirit a night. I find it very difficult if I drink a glass but cant drink more in one night. I’m totally fine not drinking at all but when I drink I can’t stop. For 2 years I’ve been hiding alcohol from my parents so I can sneak into my room and drink it. I don’t have to drink to function, I never let myself drink 2 nights in a row (unless its a special event or christmas) and i never day drink or drink before 7pm. But when I drink I have to get very drunk, which means I will drink a dangerous amount in one night, 3 times a week. The worst part about all of this is that I live in the countryside and have only one friend here. So 2/3 nights that I drink that much... I’m drinking alone.

Now. I don’t want to stop drinking because it is fun. But I really need to find a way to control how much I drink when I drink alone.

I have aspergers with serious insomnia, I am 25 and right now I can’t achieve my dream because I got a D in GSCE physics (I wanna be second officer on a cruise ship). I live with my parents and I get government benefits. It is SO hard not to drink so much when I’m all alone every night and I’m so seriously depressed about how my life is going. I do not want to cut drinking out of my life but I do want to stop HAVING to binge when I drink.

Does anyone else have this same experience?",1.422968749999999,2.772431192708336,3.245902777777779,93.164375,78.21875,6.466666666666668,21.375,7.1686216300943375,0.3774937499999997,2061,54,489,24,48,691,244,576,0.122,0.763,0.114,-0.8259,2,3,25,0,0,0,57.0,1,2,2,5,25,16,2,0,23,0,57,36,4,4,8,73,85,42,4,8,19,9,2,1,2,6,8,1,3,0,23,21,26,7,4,26,0,8,11,7,0,4,27,4,79,9,58,48,19,84,1,1,1,1,40,23,0,7,53,315,102,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033141003022176964,0.11986485330592506,0.03743732223069235,0.116163860020846,0.0,0.0,0.062217363508857065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02614160989767829,0.03830703365247097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04558110082746784,0.0412906096045656,0.031813279328931236,0.0,0.03923497499977461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03817594233104081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041932298901519074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07233387497333893,0.0,0.032201060622485775,0.0,0.15520573036392038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032717303019841236,0.0,0.0,0.8057428864594348,0.0,0.0,0.031231742673351062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024693524938456703,0.0,0.031499858994538894,0.0,0.0,0.07314262109914609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0683414283255305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057769654903286276,0.0,0.07813191105276596,0.0,0.021247690653707213,0.0,0.05980302709343776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03349108842427692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07500370200941442,0.0,0.03681831214889255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030475103774808544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038230375240467934,0.07922187429865525,0.01826522517827057,0.0,0.06602618101704215,0.03308600234994832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033742904759202275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03755990775464827,0.04072501423108396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03966131980186259,0.0,0.0,0.08952498467518252,0.0,0.08245045256354283,0.02772172187908114,0.05766976741355787,0.0,0.0,0.3157634842721055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11769297738627275,0.0,0.07600247011598375,0.08530267956755612,0.0,0.0,0.08302688473914144,0.040486090802916486,0.0,0.02591919066961921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04030912425738312,0.0,0.0,0.03758390222971403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02395084068914044,0.0,0.0,0.04013926275938892,0.0,0.031927988636406404,0.035563258715920615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061853234461198774,0.0,0.03741364294219125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09377072222097192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043600904092782285,0.0,0.0,0.07144907864530889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06169579143921385,0.08820644220780695,0.029675776814667657,0.08996792907380555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026558398338618533,0.0,0.0,0.12037886082788887
alcoholism,emotional_logic,2020/02/21,I don't want to wait until it's too late. I'm new here. I'm also semi-new to the idea that I may have a problem. I'm seeing all the signs but I'm still kind of stuck in denial. My problem seems to have started within the past year. The hard part is accepting it for what it is. But I guess I should be glad that I've caught it as early as I have and can actually do something about it.

alcoholism,Stairway-To-Survival,2020/02/21,"My mom was an alcoholic :(  This  is my mom. She died when I was six from alcoholism. I get asked a lot  what it’s like losing a parent at such a young age and here it is:  
 

 A whole part of you is shattered! My mom wasn’t involved in my life.  Her addiction to alcohol was more important than loving her child.  Looking at her in her casket made me very numb and confused. I didn’t  cry at all. At six years old, you really don’t understand  death. I felt like more of a stranger than her daughter because of the  love I wanted from her but she didn’t give me back. For a long time, I  kept asking myself if it was my fault. I knew it wasn’t my fault at all.  But the question was always there.   
 

I wished I would have had  that Mom role model in my life. I used to get jealous watching other  kids from school going up and hugging their mom. It would kill my soul  every day.   
 

Now I’m a mother, and boy am I making up for the  hugs that I missed all those years. But as for losing my mom at the age  of six, I felt like I carried broken glass within my heart for years.  After starting therapy four years ago, I’m starting to heal and move on  with my life. I have forgiven her but I haven’t been able to love her  still. Will I ever, I don’t know. Losing a parent to addiction when you  are a young child, should be nothing to experience...ever. There is help  and there is hope. Your children need you! They suffer along with the  parent who’s an addict. Yes, children do suffer too. You might not think  so, but I have experienced this ugly pain to losing my mom to addiction  and it’s an baggage you’ll carry forever if you don’t get the help to  start healing.",1.2283971291866038,3.1616248859649123,2.9085433280170143,92.6685406698565,80.84210526315789,5.782881446039339,19.7203615098352,6.850034144686104,0.1767181286549704,1269,32,281,14,33,419,168,342,0.187,0.698,0.115,-0.9825,3,0,3,0,0,0,41.0,0,8,2,4,13,23,2,1,18,1,33,20,1,3,4,43,64,18,4,9,8,12,2,3,0,6,14,0,0,6,14,10,3,1,7,0,0,2,9,14,0,4,16,5,54,9,40,41,8,38,1,7,2,5,50,13,0,7,26,198,68,1,0.07061848466179911,0.0,0.0,0.30793828784477706,0.0,0.0,0.06259902577713893,0.2264090509526677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058760236367473836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320375007281664,0.0,0.0,0.05430125568600875,0.0,0.04304837279275561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07757108941240956,0.04554308048538711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07329083785808516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387846236114399,0.05949911907783456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356096394651316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11068573069596728,0.06774368531364344,0.04013411223691809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368324433897882,0.09466816339006882,0.0,0.0,0.07014008936918388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07812889027931619,0.0,0.03881007233720153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14963977246000146,0.10350187358493837,0.0,0.0,0.06249513669157635,0.059301741396069974,0.3160160833109956,0.0,0.06003731031855219,0.1912078186109857,0.06682091767052037,0.04713838687327116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0749150524795752,0.0,0.5789526101665002,0.0,0.07505627329813938,0.0,0.052362711573153975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06776034062405985,0.0,0.074102220344804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07514304665352659,0.0,0.2352404102481349,0.07647293716763548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791088646206673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04524000956399432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07146967661870231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499523807449017,0.0,0.05639601307252819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08075839167273187,0.0,0.0,0.04524947352184672,0.0,0.0,0.04117820630510528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07351633302755686,0.0,0.060991697060492615,0.0,0.05826764561199214,0.04165261191537647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07884301619342109,0.0812077722325788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10033069072086867,0.0,0.0,0.18190395521692665
alcoholism,joshmhudson,2020/02/21,"Day 1 - Introduction Good Afternoon Everyone,

Today is my day 1 in a step in the right direction. Went to the ER for chest pain yesterday. All tests came back normal except for the ultrasound of my liver. They said it was pretty fatty but there was still plenty of time to correct it.

My habit progressed to about 12 units a night for the last 4 years. I haven’t missed a single day and the lowest day was 6 units.

I’m too young for this. I am only 27. I’m not going to let this habit define me and ruin me. Look forward to meeting you and and hearing your stories!",1.4234927536231898,3.659778008695653,3.2309782608695663,88.9670471014493,81.95652173913044,5.920289855072465,20.018115942028984,7.1686216300943375,0.5311594202898551,441,12,90,6,12,147,80,115,0.12,0.8440000000000001,0.035,-0.8955,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,1,1,5,4,0,0,8,0,7,3,2,0,2,11,16,5,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,3,1,0,6,3,10,1,15,9,2,22,0,2,1,0,6,4,0,0,15,56,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15845144072294567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23568372448595734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5315800989648221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1969041561330244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11711161787580195,0.17283773658973095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322504883768358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16797066402028427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2107156570273689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17304289270805795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19337825728345465,0.20190017169829302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15672189158675476,0.21926793132392774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2096424187134837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17597857883333712,0.1960152203378633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645639573059565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12015829160856367,0.0,0.19532574161661911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910245308814344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326992507502489
alcoholism,LivingWithBacon,2020/02/22,"I think I just need an opinion today Before I start, I'm already subscribed to al-anon, but they don't give you opinions there, it's not allowed in the sub. 

I 36(f) have been invited with my 36(m) partner for almost 7 years now. He's always been a drinker, but for the last 3 years-ish it's gotten really really bad. I'm talking 750 of vodka  in 12 hours (when he has it, sometimes it's copious amounts of wine) bad.

7 days a week I watch him just get completely hammered. I don't even know when he blacks out anymore. I feel equal parts so afraid for him, angry, and hurt. All of these feelings are really starting to take their toll on me. I find myself getting angry and really short with him and I don't want to be that way. I'm generally a very laid back person. 

He's an incredibly smart, generous, and considerate person and I really want to be here to support him, but I'm really feeling lost.

alcoholism,Naviyr,2020/02/22,"When do you realize you have a problem? Is there a point where it's ok to have a drink? You can skip this and just answer the question if you want but this is just my thought process/spiel on the question

So in college for my senior year my bf pointed out I had a problem because I would drink every weekend and sometimes weekdays. But at what point is it just a college experience from an alcoholic problem. Did it become a problem when I started drinking whenever I started feeling sad about family? Or is it the quantity that I'm drinking? Now I don't drink too much but sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night because of a family related nightmare, then go to the kitchen and get a shot. When I don't drink I'll cry for hours and eventually fall asleep and wake up with a headache and feel like crap. But when I drink everything just feels numb that I won't cry and fall asleep within an hour or two and feel less like crap. I know it's supposed to give less sleep quality but I feel like it's better than the alternative.
Now I'm just thinking when does it become an actual problem. Like is this drinking ok or am I supposed to try to stop. 

&gt;! Also sorry for any grammar or English errors because tonight is one of those nights!&lt;",4.175807879592739,5.339120314741038,4.93916998671979,84.48776339088094,70.95219123505977,7.649490925188137,31.872731297034093,7.984000788550335,2.2175071270473663,993,45,197,13,18,321,128,251,0.146,0.738,0.115,-0.8802,0,0,9,0,0,0,20.0,0,4,0,1,18,16,2,0,19,2,17,18,7,0,0,45,33,26,0,8,15,0,5,4,1,2,2,0,1,0,14,10,10,1,12,9,0,3,3,9,0,2,3,5,18,7,23,28,3,34,0,1,0,0,8,13,2,7,22,132,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0787347917852772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08622539528901563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06452202044870341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05486708300913787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14755049104650073,0.17821566722939147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0713573959500057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17725257412035753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07060607779186766,0.0,0.0,0.6323075633942963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06797875403276646,0.0,0.07251251440971487,0.07892327787677879,0.15212116055071134,0.0,0.20397828528026915,0.11527964267939693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04215344237324032,0.0773983109764203,0.045853904836941864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15891264693629914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0443411667650612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15767019782050604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05931115475447125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571535914065232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05467276560182766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22881402616044574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3860128021303465,0.0,0.0,0.1807664427039609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0807410862213035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15959474022146886,0.0903178092129936,0.11421542778306297,0.0,0.0,0.06745444863144144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05169829198025408,0.0,0.06405314517745705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054778337300088964,0.0,0.07881538956776771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04758881650858729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05731475904314951,0.0,0.0,0.05195708953733665
alcoholism,mynameiszoya,2020/02/22,"My alcoholic dad died sober this week My dad was an alcoholic my entire life. Mom left him when I was just a couple months old - I’m 37 btw. He was a very low functioning alcoholic and also struggled with mental illness. He did it all, inpatient and outpatient treatment for addiction, medication, AA, sober living house and then...I don’t know how, he got sober. It happened around the time my older brother and him reconnected about 10 years ago. It was like I had to learn how to cope with sober dad like I had learned to cope with drunk dad when I was younger. He died at home, somewhat unexpectedly, and so I didn’t get the chance to tell him enough that I was proud of him for getting sober. When I spoke with the coroner and he was talking about how there was no indication that drugs or alcohol caused his death, I literally broke down crying. My dad, suffered from the lifelong disease of alcoholism and died a sober man. I can’t even articulate what that means to me as his daughter. To anyone reading this that struggles with alcoholism, addiction or mental illness, I’m rooting for you...every minute, every hour, every day you are sober, and I am so proud of you.",4.650065651260505,6.286866165178576,5.036323529411764,82.42338235294119,70.38392857142857,8.306302521008401,29.247899159663863,8.841846274778883,2.28261481092437,927,36,178,17,17,294,125,224,0.172,0.773,0.055,-0.9796,0,0,7,0,0,0,32.0,0,2,0,2,15,9,0,2,8,0,16,14,0,5,1,28,25,20,4,0,3,8,0,2,0,0,13,1,1,1,10,14,7,0,4,2,0,0,4,5,1,0,14,1,24,4,24,11,3,17,0,3,0,0,25,5,0,3,14,108,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21892714779681244,0.0,0.0,0.08900891320897568,0.6438574184115239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08029919990035299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07021019505560219,0.0,0.0,0.08938770116944046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10315047517509096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11110363575739254,0.11029753705138932,0.06475723939578681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3126344736968317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11644569294280348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10375212743633212,0.0,0.06632098058709845,0.0,0.2538035629275029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10492193741229487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08030840896142809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887937343503747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10072112177836724,0.0,0.09888529771922644,0.11586161981706344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05518364411283851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10909760542691092,0.0,0.07092375296127648,0.0981121688771561,0.0,0.08866537038322837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093777775736958,0.0,0.10115422351048188,0.20238275224612826,0.0,0.0,0.11760096900339426,0.08014766064519234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10536518767472276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043887244193353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20994422029941492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08070712061892167,0.0877642512839353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058550869532077374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08285016814212473,0.0,0.0,0.0805442086867735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06466184242193823

As someone who has beaten my addictions, I try to help as much as I can to let people see how great life can be. I recommend everyone check out the hydro homie subreddit. Alcohol has quite a bit of advertising and normalcy that we all fight sometimes. This is a sub for people that really enjoy drinking water.    

Water is pretty cool as is. You can have it cold. You can have it room temp. You can drink it when you’re super thirsty in the middle of the night. It makes you feel good to drink all day.     

It’s a pretty good community. Anyone trading booze (or soda) for that sweet sweet H2O is more than welcome.

alcoholism,Elvarania,2020/02/22,"What do you look forward to each day? One of the scariest(?) things that I encounter each time I try to stop is that there is nothing to look forward to. I absolutely loath the notion of having a 'quiet night'. Without drink, what is there to look forward to? A meal? Reading a book before bed?

What makes me so *frustrated* is that there are so many things to look forward to. A cosy bed, a good book. Not waking up feeling like shit. No anxiety. The biggest (no pun intended) side effect of my alcoholism is massive weight gain. Why can't I replace drinking 10 beers a night with going for a run? I have a bench press, exercise bike and rowing machine in my flat. All gone unused for 2 years.

I gave up smoking 2 years ago. I can give up an addiction. I have absolutely no desire to smoke. It smells awful. Why can't I give up drinking when all of my associated thoughts are negative?",1.3384695843655408,3.889167416184975,2.969677952105698,88.44443159922932,85.82080924855492,5.607376823561795,24.423066336361128,7.07126945348624,1.1683632810349571,685,28,135,10,21,225,104,173,0.12300000000000001,0.809,0.068,-0.8149,0,0,6,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,0,2,6,4,2,0,12,1,14,11,2,3,2,15,26,4,0,1,2,0,3,1,0,0,3,1,2,0,9,4,7,1,3,9,0,7,8,2,0,1,3,9,14,2,22,23,4,23,0,0,4,0,4,11,1,0,14,88,23,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15397473864544348,0.0,0.0,0.12520260083218912,0.1509448519328976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804982097594966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12018662532083707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108947073682076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4150904638332896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07141625031918848,0.10090338546314342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2709845875691897,0.08027114115229916,0.11846717346994202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06900375633093446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4744311697820291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09428019944877193,0.14319732199728305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2650922883269836,0.0,0.13552560561582408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09570930328435616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14128032352061656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14498298738568646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11808472117477507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876699522921484,0.0,0.0,0.11213045161741728,0.08235940516643718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09589411547697001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17199482866406024,0.0,0.0,0.2548980554236793,0.0,0.0,0.13615234551545088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18191056499747169
alcoholism,laceupcase19xx,2020/02/22,"Feeling alone So around 2 years ago I got sober and declared myself an alcoholic. I subscribed to the program of AA wholeheartedly and got a sponsor, worked the steps, sponsored someone the whole 9 yards. But the longer I spent in the rooms the less I could relate to. see I’m a binge drinker I was never physically addicted to alcohol and I could walk away at anytime. Every time I drank it was my choice and everyone around me was saying they lost the power of choice and they couldn’t put it down no matter how hard they tried. So I can’t relate to that and don’t even know if I’m an alcoholic. I now have 36 days sober after a recent relapse and just don’t know. I know we aren’t supposed to declare anyone alcoholic but does anyone else feel like me?

alcoholism,mw_mills,2020/02/22,"I Don't Know How I've been drinking every day for the past 20+ years. It started as a way to loosen up and have fun. For the most part it has remained that way. But things are taking a darker turn. People tell me more and more that I am picking fights. I find myself checking my texts in the morning making sure I apologize to who I need to. The moment liquor hits my lips, I'm blacking out. I remember what happens in the moment. But the following day everything is a blur.

I do not want to do this. I feel like I am not in control. When I wake in the morning I can feel my liver is inflamed. Everything is telling me to stop. But I don't. Sometimes the first thing I want to do is take a drink just to get this day behind me. It's like I am living on a treadmill of pain. The only progress made is the humiliations earned. I have been lately thinking that I could put a stop to it. But I don't want to hurt my family. It feels like my footprint has become a black ink that bleeds into the past and future, deleting everything but shame and the way forward cannot be seen as there is no compass, no guiding star, and no assurance other than the knowledge that I'll once more drink myself into oblivion and live again in this shadow. 

How do I stop?",2.1688732888732893,3.797862849420852,3.580514215514217,90.36058529308531,76.87644787644788,6.099052299052299,23.74183924183925,6.782984794422108,0.6794617760617756,974,31,209,9,22,320,137,259,0.115,0.815,0.069,-0.8571,0,0,3,0,1,0,26.0,0,0,0,4,6,10,1,1,20,0,27,10,3,6,2,43,48,16,0,5,8,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,18,9,4,4,8,4,1,3,9,4,0,1,4,6,28,6,26,41,5,33,0,1,3,0,5,11,0,2,21,147,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12490257351287785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12684366000573258,0.09029573174330084,0.0,0.0,0.21880730807446824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323648945154856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09528591346531354,0.0,0.3049226749522055,0.0,0.10661422047755838,0.0,0.17154998660890686,0.16158763444482413,0.0,0.0,0.10336515199403594,0.09619703308338044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0590865384250144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000079587927842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12106862844822218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062153074728173476,0.0,0.1275740754022235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16575490062316384,0.0,0.1997267661396749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701153693547713,0.07549060090495137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08385718782225557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12044058573874344,0.0,0.08601248813042509,0.12033915714922445,0.0,0.0,0.12246893376457152,0.21592054585186105,0.07840459729246642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136899202047288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12811256929101245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11185208395355467,0.0,0.08004796147701479,0.0,0.0,0.28365298157926805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658901914764636,0.0,0.17006404996202906,0.0,0.19769691386667804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15026821700813006,0.07246556730887657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12301294517102958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2001159295844803,0.26930439613097445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07282832420226297

alcoholism,whatsup-fuckers,2020/02/23,"how can i (20F) reconcile with girlfriend (21F) after drunken fuck up okay guys... so yesterday i fucked up, and i really fucked up. i’m in a new relationship and we happen to be gay so it was a big moment for me to meet her family, they made us dinner... i was excited too but at some point i started making shitty choices and got too drunk while we were out at the club before hand.

this eventually led to me going home alone last night and being unsure what i can do to possibly fix this. she sent me the most heartbreaking message last night that says 

“This fucking sucks. I’m home and I’m reminded of the wasted effort R. I sat down to eat what my mom made. She even brought out filipino foods that came from phol she thought you’d like. They made the table for us and even  cleaned my room. New sheets, blanket folded nicely”

I know i have really really hurt her and i don’t know where to start fixing things. i really need any sort of advice, i’m giving her some space at the moment like she requested but my heart is racing and i feel like we are in a sort of limbo. last night she got so cold to me that it really shocked me, i don’t ever want to see that side of her again.

another issue that makes this more complicated is her closeness to her stepdad. he is aware we are together and he is also aware of the truth of what happened last night, so only a few months into the relationship i have already fucked up my reputation with her parents who she adores. please help me.",2.854414715719064,4.5761353377926435,4.189450167224082,86.32837591973245,75.22073578595317,7.459585284280938,22.32789297658863,8.238735603445708,1.1389929364548492,1162,31,240,20,25,383,164,299,0.145,0.74,0.115,-0.9357,1,1,0,0,0,0,30.0,6,1,2,1,13,17,6,0,11,1,19,12,2,7,2,43,53,18,0,2,2,2,2,3,1,0,0,1,4,1,16,20,4,0,5,2,0,5,2,9,0,0,13,5,46,8,34,37,5,45,0,2,1,6,38,20,6,5,23,155,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693943914430062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214501211297883,0.09817946097853288,0.07114844608525736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06050194445529693,0.0932917131087332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07570603306205283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017567899499104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910374583783712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11752631950201615,0.08047751892616332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08387201853415117,0.0,0.044985379973847724,0.06355944361990007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10758162097075462,0.0,0.0,0.4112518547660041,0.0,0.08534713447130568,0.05056311091007131,0.0,0.14231321139626568,0.0,0.0,0.08809325921518266,0.15734991703469084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10542864732745126,0.0596340192712878,0.0,0.17848624423126538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09524311300715238,0.0,0.0,0.0928604805751682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977900286135494,0.2900863114538472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13039722126110473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525537466489167,0.1187749448411911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10419937201236344,0.07101417597373723,0.0,0.0,0.06596935736851793,0.0,0.17185355415195885,0.0,0.3339653724531099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06766490404684786,0.0,0.0,0.09878950258649516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09766120246125357,0.08410442559306791,0.10029913586062672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2849789734545014,0.0,0.0,0.19103873713422745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07075168885632259,0.0,0.0,0.07089674318353165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259453772404482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05910702449235019,0.0,0.0,0.07063141722092563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2140374115999719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05247619839050575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,jsnow1204,2020/02/23,"Turning to Reddit in search of honest answers. Hello, all, and thank you for taking the time to read this post. Basically, I know the answer can only come from me, probably, but it can't hurt to get the opinions from others. 

I don't know if I technically have a problem with alcohol or not. Thus, I do not know if meetings would be necessary or if I'd be welcome. Allow me to explain. 

From 21-24 I spent the weeks binge drinking. Probably 2-3 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. I enjoy it a lot. I don't care for the after effects. 

From 25 until now, the amount of times I get drunk is less but I can't recall the last time I went a week without anything. I mostly drink at least a tall can with dinner 2-3 times a week. Lately, though, (past month) I've not been doing that, but instead drinking 6-10 standard drinks on the weekend.

I have compulsive behavior. I know this. I guess I am seeking advice. I care about my family and I want to be healthy. I just enjoy alcohol a little too much sometimes. Do I have reason to be concerned? I know 6-10 isn't a lot on a Saturday or Sunday now, but I'm a very thin man and it takes a tall can to feel it. I want to be sober for a long time. Part of me doesn't. I just want to be able to drink moderately. As in, once or twice a month. A drink or two. Even a drink or two a year. That seems unrealistic for me. 

My dad and and his dad are also alcoholics. And from what I've heard this runs in families. 

Am I just overreacting lol

TL;DR: My drinking habits vary, can drink heavy amounts occasionally, rarely go more than a week without at least a standard drink or two. Is there reason for concern?",0.9270163398692794,3.0812790676470603,3.0168627450980385,90.25477124183008,83.32352941176471,5.777777777777778,21.79738562091504,7.054809383877858,0.6289346405228766,1273,42,275,17,36,430,168,340,0.043,0.848,0.109,0.9575,0,0,13,0,0,0,56.0,0,1,0,1,12,9,0,0,26,1,29,15,0,5,1,59,55,24,0,8,22,2,2,0,0,1,3,1,0,1,11,9,15,0,13,13,1,4,11,2,0,4,4,3,32,7,39,44,14,41,0,1,0,0,10,11,0,16,25,187,43,1,0.0679922494267024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644123922705049,0.0,0.2179891106211195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054373377301610785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05595182796307063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386452594728107,0.0,0.0,0.05856930243589833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6660651951846766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044908239496160365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281940832085173,0.0,0.03437892424865178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07104628809769277,0.0,0.038641562231197885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490112825749265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278710926043576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1868338106698864,0.055422758087407216,0.07669821888724856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0681460961303882,0.0,0.06017100115131905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11560915807346744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10854152961699308,0.0,0.04998212661711369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07240952661247012,0.0,0.051711169537108255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07362898033278112,0.0649062955611732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06511778015709124,0.0,0.1466142894173766,0.06505940014749535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06801064909501797,0.0,0.0,0.13981471300760215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06189759026777029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20173821972097436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224341965806903,0.0,0.0,0.06259812822530318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0668020398462291,0.0,0.2378809645193765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739560429103317,0.1992556440889224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05610072650143354,0.12031077099092327,0.0,0.27269640630419045,0.0,0.0,0.06302949640375108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13108420427652434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04829974319979161,0.0,0.0,0.043784779417333816
alcoholism,charlieoliver5599,2020/02/23,"Advice for a child of an alcoholic Little bit of background of my family: parent is an alcoholic, when I confronted them about it a few months ago (tipping point was they were put in charge of children and proceeded to drink and pass out) they told me they had been going to meetings and talking with friends for 2 years. I felt betrayed, lied to by others, and was made to feel like a crazy person when I asked if there was a problem. This drinking happened all throughout my childhood and when I asked for help I was told it was natural to have fights with parents, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand Alcoholism is a disease but it seems to me they are using all these steps to feel like they're a ""good person"" (their words, not mine I don't think alcoholics are bad people) while never actually stopping drinking. How do I try to keep them in my life while also saying they have to take actual steps to right wrongs and try to get sober?

alcoholism,bobbyfrosty,2020/02/23,"How do you deal with the shame/lack of memory after a blackout? I had an awful night Friday, and can't remember between about 1am-8am. I made a fool of myself, was sick down myself, and was denied my bus home at the bus station where I think I slept or annoyed the staff until I was in a better state to travel. I am super embarrassed and overwhelmed with shame.

I don't drink much but when I do I can't stop or control myself. I will be making positive changes about this, I already go to Al Anon due to my upbringing but I think I can't deny that I also have a problem after this weekend.

I was thinking that maybe taking chocolates or something to the bus station staff would help me out with how I'm feeling - or do you think I would feel better just forgetting about it and working on being and doing better?",6.119037940379402,5.59296930487805,6.698373983739837,79.49432249322494,66.3170731707317,8.75230352303523,31.636856368563684,7.793537801064563,2.167060433604336,642,22,123,6,9,211,97,164,0.10400000000000001,0.7240000000000001,0.17300000000000001,0.9252,0,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,0,2,0,6,9,10,1,3,9,1,20,3,1,5,0,33,32,16,0,3,7,0,2,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,5,9,1,2,7,3,0,2,4,6,0,0,7,2,24,4,21,20,1,17,0,1,0,0,4,6,0,4,8,97,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1919756828662221,0.13912045743533244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4615760710958219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18403284199257489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19511753552626668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17935119126527688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704203403107371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17592475968806118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09886882294988247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11660566739275653,0.0,0.1745019695413513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16461072913525765,0.1161235808183506,0.0,0.17477211666578554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12788494413345125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16325520070938368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664618597954877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19706943799059967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13392743945350208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14544327168295998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13080069712868325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4458812652735433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266492380726305,0.0,0.0,0.2471607504051449,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,wittylittlepieceof,2020/02/23,"So my mum got hospitalised. Again. For context: My mother has been drinking excessively for the past 20 or so years, tried to kill herself 5 years ago, was in inpatient therapy for a few months back then but didn't feel the need to quit.

Now, 5 years later, she looks like she's just been killing herself at a much slower rate with the help of her sister. When I got home on wednesday she just sat on the floor because her knees would give out under her so I called the ambulance even though she didn't want me to. She looks terrible. She's stick thin except for her huge bloated belly and ankles, she has a slightly yellow-ish tinge to her skin and she's pale as a ghost.

The day after her sister visited me because she wanted to ""talk"" and after I gently suggested that maybe an assisted living situation would be the best she started accusing me of not caring about her and wanting to get rid of her. So I snapped. And I told her that before she brings wine and hard liquor again for easter she should just take one of our kitchen knives. Because if she plans on killing my mother, she should at least quit dragging it out so much.",6.092528458088998,6.125616210762335,5.8632286995515726,83.57900310451882,66.26457399103138,8.834632631942046,29.70989996550535,8.384062270229773,1.9366656778199385,897,28,180,11,13,279,134,223,0.126,0.7929999999999999,0.081,-0.8757,1,0,2,0,0,0,21.0,1,0,0,4,16,7,3,0,12,0,12,6,2,0,0,26,29,18,4,9,8,5,4,1,0,4,0,0,2,0,3,9,4,0,1,3,0,2,3,4,0,1,9,6,37,3,30,15,5,32,0,0,2,0,38,12,0,2,19,126,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170839500918486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10156396895536382,0.0,0.24155041403741745,0.0,0.11239323102906944,0.0,0.13861336217417786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13487190244682165,0.0,0.13466781245990855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08518285542596223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12939143124297406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08723982914914702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06678532740167381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06900811638200299,0.12670641710205607,0.0,0.0,0.21127829579762647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832076787071688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08853270781809587,0.0,0.1324904031555366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4383920824628396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06452926942971357,0.0,0.11663204758440225,0.0,0.2218335523206447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326955120234862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10542769662773313,0.0,0.1941929692862196,0.09793815530503022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950311906132649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12608853517726792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809738738131875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14846725722520446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09348929873017152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09931026647523238,0.1061636204951409,0.0,0.0,0.15104886030928036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12977125374727308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12621133332352588,0.0,0.0896759472725021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2337186054008573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18765649208126994,0.0,0.0,0.2551721055127009
alcoholism,Ferriswheeloflife,2020/02/23,"To the sober alcoholics, would you consider me an alcoholic? How do I compare to how you were before you got sober? So I plan on starting my sober journey here within the next few days. It’s something I know I can’t keep putting off, as drinking the way I do will end up putting me in a bad situation eventually. I’m just curious, for those of you that began your sober journey, how much do I compare to the way you were before you stopped drinking? I drink after work almost every night, and will almost always continue drinking until I fall asleep with a beer by my side. I roll the dice and drive regardless of my drinking, and while I’m not exactly a liability to others because I ride a motorcycle, I’m very much a liability to myself. I wouldn’t really consider myself an alcoholic, because my drinking doesn’t really affect my life all that much. I don’t drink during the day, and rarely miss work due my drinking the night before. My hangovers aren’t all that bad, and I don’t really have any withdrawal systems between drinks. That being said, for reasons previously outlined I plan on starting my sober journey, and while I don’t really consider myself an alcoholic, I definitely have a drinking problem. I’m just curious about how I stack up to where you all were when you decided to get sober?",6.4897343957503315,6.840612501992034,7.437195219123505,71.54548738379816,65.41434262948206,10.677397078353255,35.45843293492696,10.504223727775694,3.868590225763613,1042,47,185,25,15,351,120,251,0.05,0.888,0.062,-0.5054,1,0,16,0,0,0,25.0,0,9,0,4,11,4,0,0,16,0,19,17,1,6,4,30,32,16,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,0,0,7,7,15,2,3,11,0,8,8,4,0,0,6,1,39,0,25,21,7,37,0,1,0,0,10,9,0,2,17,132,46,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3285900972223491,0.15394254043924402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395956245859041,0.0,0.0,0.05227224554856874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12836159049015405,0.09371490853644797,0.0,0.19622465287797344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914580610755144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7530046797471256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06808141135366033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476382428230644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04015987308974462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06147762024745707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06832298634285287,0.0,0.0,0.04224413309282896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054293486914577235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16951842936019776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08174900421146544,0.14426908185146609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735514077702583,0.0,0.15454527845794985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1969720611224232,0.0790321532737009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07311818883961961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08640181069630896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05917602820834358,0.0,0.0,0.10881381985473444,0.0,0.0,0.06426431493758808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06342338542562674,0.0,0.12202700941609172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11192028930491474,0.0,0.0,0.05460416326053996,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Turing45,2020/02/23,"Follow up To My Original Post "" Leaving An Alcoholic"" Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/c21zcs/leaving\_an\_alcoholic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/c21zcs/leaving_an_alcoholic/) 

Its been 8 months since I left and I had filed for divorce almost a month ago. After one scathing round of text messages, it had been radio silence. I was moving on with my life with my new love and things were/are going well

This morning I received terribly sad news: His best friends became worried when they hadnt heard from him and he missed a couple planned gatherings this last week. They couldnt reach him by phone or text so they drove out to his place. His car was in its space, the blinds were drawn. They knocked but the only sound from the inside was of his dogs. Police were called and after some convincing, they agreed to do a welfare check. He was found in bed and had been dead for a couple of days. 

I dont know cause of death yet, but the speculations are either suicide or stroke. He was 53 years old. My only hope is that he is finally at peace.",6.215051051051053,9.416586508108107,4.3642792792792795,82.07873123123125,70.4054054054054,6.057057057057057,22.16966966966967,7.1686216300943375,0.6404714714714714,884,22,152,9,18,250,122,185,0.127,0.743,0.131,-0.3043,0,0,5,0,1,1,48.0,0,0,5,2,4,9,0,0,9,0,20,5,0,3,0,23,29,11,3,2,5,0,2,0,1,0,4,2,1,0,7,8,1,0,2,1,1,6,3,3,1,1,17,5,20,6,22,11,3,33,0,2,2,1,24,9,0,5,16,95,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13985778364354634,0.16861321013637298,0.1579886073221801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1655748512230146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1611056454552801,0.0,0.0,0.16207811464787225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3491494883279141,0.0,0.10175165216887512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849108152329165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17283451102618422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17299185414082113,0.12189636944934296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966701823667328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15670591230377884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08670886859247214,0.12860746753499505,0.0,0.16706066426669286,0.17142271201539916,0.0,0.11144096180073657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14239785893502832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518685776049075,0.1676895750645312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15237982292651506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16555804458341633,0.0,0.10691224417421713,0.23998959225204436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648410181991601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30220916773201456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13051289179659298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17257995301491105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10481852377511444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12655737617881035,0.0,0.1418584354070456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16022790270370935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10160175696346528

alcoholism,Undercover500,2020/02/23,"What’s the cut off # of drinks for being alcoholic? I usually have 2-3 drinks a night, at home, on the weekends and 1-2 drinks maybe 2-3 nights during the week, but its usually early, around dinner and I never go to bed feeling drunk or anything. I don’t drink so much for the feeling of being drunk (I’d have to drink more if I wanted that), I just like that little bit of relaxation you get after about a drink or two. 

My usual drink is 1.5-2oz of vodka topped off with 7up or a rum and coke. I don’t drink straight liquor, but I do enjoy a glass of wine as well. 

Is my drinking anything to be worried about? I don’t feel the need to drink, I just enjoy to have one or two a couple times a week.",3.646637233259749,3.2683004039735124,5.019558498896249,88.95787343635028,71.4503311258278,7.770713760117734,24.72479764532745,6.937597516519254,0.7449464311994118,535,12,126,4,9,180,86,151,0.071,0.763,0.16699999999999998,0.9367,0,0,13,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,0,1,7,6,1,0,11,0,12,17,0,0,1,20,19,12,0,3,9,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,4,5,17,0,3,18,0,1,4,1,1,3,0,3,12,5,22,16,3,21,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,5,13,81,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920870003710782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14181724915662655,0.07670746692087284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09407274408752557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09534285313472772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8441148142863859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13070684131515206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045019034710778665,0.0,0.04897105472907893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643316715799676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04209715570609438,0.08636261089050855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656697465383678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06334312891900253,0.06389221216791036,0.06645779492581819,0.0,0.0,0.16172498326997625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05838942192596415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05024504298758757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16834652445596354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2847044406129401,0.0,0.05082390575069616,0.0,0.13823696420600615,0.0,0.0774750553850655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08750741963693069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,noporn2435,2020/02/24,"Coming up to 4 weeks since my last drink I'm not sure if I would be classed as an alcoholic but alcohol ruined a lot of the good in my life. It ruined my relationship and after she broke it off (completely understandable) I went through 2 months of being black out drunk 4+ times a week sneaking alcohol into the house so my friends / family didn't know how much I was drinking. Then one day I woke up and realised I'm not the person I went to be when I'm drink. I'm toxic and hurt the people I care about. It saddens me that I had to lose someone so important to me out of my life for me to realise this but with every day passing it gets easier not to use alcohol to solve my emotions. I'm so proud of myself for fixing this in me and I never want to drink again. Ive started being able to be around drinking and be fine with a soft drink.

alcoholism,kristine0711,2020/02/24,"Slowly realising I may have a problem Short backstory (possible TW): I (20F) have struggled with depression, anxiety, self harm and eating disorders since I was 14. A couple weeks before Christmas I met up with a guy u had been talking to online for a little while. During that night, he raped me while I was asleep.

Ever since that night, I’ve taken to alcohol to numb the pain. I can probably count on one hand the number of days I’ve avoided alcohol since then. 


For the past month some of my friends has expressed their concerns about my drinking. But I’ve always brushed it aside, saying I got it under control and that it’s not a big deal and all that. Because, you know, that’s what I’m convincing myself of. 

But here I am, visiting my mom during winter break from school (I’m a part time high school student), and for the second night in a row I’m quite wasted. And I’m slowly realising that maybe my friends are right, maybe I do have a problem. But I just don’t see the point of stopping, you know? Because as long as I drink, I can ignore all the pain. As long as I drink, I can feel some kind of happiness, it may be a fake kind of happiness, but at least it’s some form of it. 

And for the first time in my life, I’m actually scared of what I may end up doing to myself. I can’t stop all these destructive patterns. And alcohol is my only escape. 


I’m so sorry for the rant for the few of you who may end up reading this. I’m just so lost and don’t really know what to do anymore.",3.0253136949440598,4.180433358306189,4.529007222772979,86.36578388330267,73.72312703583061,7.684407307746778,25.39994335080017,8.18289091462,1.4235317660388045,1159,37,247,18,23,388,159,307,0.16699999999999998,0.782,0.052000000000000005,-0.9845,0,1,6,0,0,0,41.0,0,3,1,4,7,22,2,3,18,0,25,14,2,1,4,39,41,21,0,2,7,1,2,0,2,4,7,1,0,2,18,10,7,5,4,4,0,1,4,15,0,3,8,5,29,7,36,28,10,37,0,2,1,1,17,14,0,7,21,161,47,4,0.0,0.0,0.09214095146802476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3027209362909145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856555952595648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223155245786038,0.0,0.09363993090826588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511592547020268,0.0,0.08034503392215317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10590080773636484,0.0,0.10447467305659182,0.0,0.060893519530679424,0.09734356254676653,0.08132438285575028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10821426556916136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27748892448239737,0.0,0.09661591534721614,0.0,0.0,0.16725737233678414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08540889974770507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047741926684194684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08031417183098777,0.0,0.0,0.14589834750718697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07551683356484584,0.0,0.0,0.09349130595913648,0.0,0.20102511332449247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09976061962872282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966491914257563,0.15567338919536253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06669211004719817,0.0,0.0946343143764501,0.0,0.16711863958881867,0.0,0.0,0.10307131272050796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1897165036938391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058434500376378,0.07536567624520782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2658222016128121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06398188815535406,0.07181117265155268,0.2009404954704123,0.0,0.0,0.10224838204521487,0.0901352113757813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08925805056698102,0.10644511602502647,0.0,0.0,0.101801449713689,0.1806956546687883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10042800271895627,0.09444621941497118,0.0,0.0604882975985149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063473443070457,0.0,0.07508710483550891,0.09453156032782306,0.19111751346853584,0.07524104758443903,0.0,0.09850134894096688,0.0,0.0,0.2343172564637427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056962073143998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578798123859199,0.0,0.09870898295262603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589175621950542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11011490145831583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07573856437540268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Cheap-Design,2020/02/24,"Husband hates me when I'm sober I'm a happy drunk, red wine has been my medication every day for the past 7 years. 

When I'm sober, I'm incredibly irritable, angry, and want nothing more than to be alone and depressed. The longest I've been sober was two months (last September-October) and every day was torture. 

My husband is easily able to go sober, but I have a hard time. We're trying to get pregnant so I need to stop drinking. Whenever I stop drinking, I'm not the happy, bubbly girl my husband expects. I isolate myself, and he starts saying thing like ""I should've married an extrovert"" and ""other women don't act like this."" His words spiral me into drinking again, sometimes in secret. There are times where I've snapped at him (and I apologize) but he'll tell me things like ""If you snap at me again I'm leaving. Just go drink so you chill out."" 

This has been the hardest part of quitting for me. I'm on anti-anxiety meds to help with this while I try to go sober, but they only work some days. I've told my husband that when I go sober I'll need alone time and I'm not going to be happy 24/7. He disappointingly says he knows that, but then will talk and talk and expect me to listen to everything when I just want to explode. Then I get the ""Are you even listening?

alcoholism,guarpati,2020/02/24,"Can't get over drinking  They say ""old habits die hard"" and I guess that's true!

Hi there! I am 27 y.o. male struggling to give up smoking and drinking and generally destructing myself. I need someone to tell me that this is doable because I am tired of trying and failing.

I can't make a shortcut of my situation so you'll have to stick with me here. I've been smoking and drinking for almost 8 years straight no attempts to give up at all. I never gave it any thought, never thought why I am doing this to myself. I guess I was just young and stupid. I had quite a rough childhood...well it was good, not complaining here, but I had a few traumatic incidents and problems with parent support - grown up without father (died when I was 12, seen him a couple of times before he passed away) and my mother never cared about my teen issues. So I grew up learning to deal with my problems on my own, friends were never there to truly understand and not just ""listen"". Fifteen years old me was having quintessential issues - all I thought about at the time was what's my purpose of living and why on Earth I was born in such a shitty place to live (living in a shithole in some CIS country btw).

I guess all that stuff eventually determined my behavior in some way. I started having this tendency of self-destruction. As years passed I kept on smoking and drinking. Been in a deep depression couple of times, but made it through eventually. Traveled around the world for some time and after coming back home I began working as an ESL teacher (had to make a living somehow) then I found that I am doing pretty well at teaching and it became my profession. My job was incompatible with smoking so I quit. I still don't really understand how I gave it up so easily. I quitted cold turkey, but the other self-destructive habits remained. For some time I was really happy with myself - life took a new turn and it seemed to be brighter than it ever was. But all good things must come to an end, right!?

After three years of not smoking I started all over. Came back from 0 to 15 cigarettes a day. It was awful, I hated every single cigarette I smoked, but this time I couldn't quit. So last half a year I was trying to give up smoking because it affects my mind. I can't think clearly when I smoke, my decision making became worse and critical thinking in general has blunted. I've been failing to quit over and over again. Every time I returned to smoking I analyzed what I did wrong to start it again and couldn't see the reason behind it. Then I've made some research into why I am doing what I am doing and found out that this self-destructive behavior comes from my adolescence - I tend to smoke and drink whenever I feel bad or stressed and I perceive it as a support of some kind, which makes sense since nobody ever was there to support me when I needed it.

Now I work on myself. I've put a lot of effort to quit smoking. I go to the gym and work my ass off, also I work on my mindset and always try to keep myself in a good state, but however long I hold on to good things in my life there's always a moment when I break - something happens and I start feeling this urge to smoke or drink. It feels like some part of me just can't stand me being a ""good guy"". So I am wondering is it even possible to overcome this dark part of my nature that always wants me to destroy myself and hate life?! I look at it as a battle and I always lose it. Neither cigarettes nor alcohol give no pleasure or consolation any more, but still can't get rid of that shit.

TL;DR - struggling to overcome bad habits, fail to keep self-improvement consistent.

Sorry if there were any mistakes in my post, English is not my mother tongue.  
Any advice/help/words of consolation will be greatly appreciated.",4.223783983269776,5.635917138024357,5.0748096936892635,82.6103520728257,71.12449255751015,7.647887809078607,28.050707344076773,8.121257012390899,1.8622771853856563,2971,108,566,42,55,966,329,739,0.161,0.7390000000000001,0.1,-0.9942,3,0,15,0,0,0,88.0,0,1,1,16,38,39,7,3,24,1,53,13,2,9,14,124,114,55,2,10,19,4,5,1,1,3,5,2,1,2,39,37,7,4,18,8,0,12,21,22,1,2,35,11,85,17,96,71,20,105,0,5,3,1,23,39,2,19,50,402,124,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05344897574154038,0.05008106561385819,0.0,0.0,0.03999559403814351,0.16646018884618885,0.0,0.0,0.13604295481324766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044522413827439766,0.0,0.0,0.04698911360507843,0.07691423516023882,0.08351798297331214,0.06097525050605325,0.0,0.04255760921271262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057201857319334526,0.05099186208747174,0.0,0.0,0.12924601116808185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11067746421953832,0.0,0.03225442172672728,0.051561485408699134,0.04307635626109018,0.0,0.10381175659553216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2939637867455471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04429691259294742,0.0,0.0,0.033033293221661666,0.09047973225756208,0.08427667424565204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07586463629562497,0.03572949016013071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10967393845332238,0.03864012842416266,0.0,0.05225973882236901,0.1919091437945261,0.028423693960111338,0.20974379052618009,0.0,0.05513980685928136,0.1652857667182381,0.04952100048461157,0.04422656958743537,0.053240056025703836,0.044802066411701265,0.09875549990983412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0335228407206418,0.0,0.05016738775371387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10440172027990127,0.049630453410585376,0.08890818489049368,0.0,0.05208112457082259,0.0,0.04076749032237337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10597755524168014,0.024433957508182242,0.0,0.17665053517294865,0.04426017022204593,0.04199855072894953,0.0559520563547075,0.0,0.04251949375656112,0.0,0.09464753089784624,0.13353698463290853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05049914563102799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741684121423187,0.1542932685183622,0.04830312792522175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10496102768696423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05553381778633537,0.10831899554435538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05225322248364644,0.0,0.0,0.05638244741777225,0.04789888782117169,0.05088147579763571,0.0,0.0957118901123426,0.0,0.050277150219040376,0.0,0.3191716141063054,0.0,0.0,0.06407956299163567,0.0514219713720628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04271105940658023,0.0,0.039772559777617865,0.0,0.0,0.03985410103823201,0.045530202741622665,0.20869899285704954,0.0,0.05133790305851906,0.04137149385835445,0.05621701107817904,0.0,0.0,0.04237608146550854,0.03850265875843735,0.0,0.055985761242074994,0.14159860000466187,0.0,0.07988132423018675,0.0,0.057290031934481914,0.1045694579294688,0.057253228706588825,0.0,0.17026339871230387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043713802500770116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06645318869131257,0.06409296807906156,0.0,0.11911484979398175,0.2041419799828522,0.057482896742879236,0.0,0.0,0.055566583319727886,0.10186718234346047,0.05440007620827924,0.0,0.104131155995659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02949912251037402,0.039698205887683684,0.0,0.0,0.04496793618170037,0.0,0.13538759162481348,0.0,0.0,0.048211007658904674,0.05423725801166936,0.14564102518273214,0.0,0.05096779499589461,0.0,0.054681659651258194,0.0,0.16103453100875031
alcoholism,hailey363,2020/02/24,"Always wanting more            As a 21 year old finishing an undergrad I’m growing out of the stage where partying is considered a lifestyle. What I’ve realized about myself is I’m all or nothing- I don’t just have one drink. If I have one, what’s wrong with a bunch more? And why not add weed to the mix? 
           Something I struggle with is figuring out what any substances really give me. Why do I chase being drunk so consistently? I feel like a kid, so powerless to my own lack of self control. I’m not at the stage where I can actively say I’m an alcoholic but I can say I’m on the road to it. 
           I’m on here because I wanted to ask what people’s opinions were in regards to going off substances cold turkey vs. setting strict rules for yourself in terms of amounts consumed. What worked best for you?

alcoholism,KittyWhereAre,2020/02/24,"So I'm 20 and I think im an alcoholic I'm 20 years old and a mother to a 2 year old child. I have been drinking heavily since the age of 13 and the only time I didn't drink was during my pregnancy and the 9 months in which I breast fed my daughter. I've put down dropping drinking to my morals, I couldn't have given alcohol to an unwilling victim or have exposed her to it whilst I was feeding her. Even during that time I was constantly craving and pumping my milk in large amounts just so I could have a drink. I know I have a real problem here and am so scared and worried aboit it. The main concern is that I do not know who I am without it and that I don't know how I will he able to enjoy life without it (not that I really enjoy my life with it anyway.) I am intelligent enough to know how these things pan out but I am just in so deep that I do not know what to do. I have a lot of shame around my drinking and i tend to excuse myself a great deal since drinking and being intoxicated does not turn me into a violent or nasty person. I need help, someone please convince me that life can be good without it.

alcoholism,anothathrowaway1337,2020/02/24,"I relapsed last night... Hello Reddit, I'm George from Turkey (not my real name). I felt like writing my thoughts down so I decided to do it here.   

&amp;nbsp;

I don't see myself as an alcoholic, rather a fellow who likes drinking more than people around me. I'm in my early 20s and studying computer science in a fairly prestigious school. I didn't start consuming alcohol before my last year of high school. Well, I did drink beer before but I stopped quite soon and never had 2 drinks in a day. Most of my friends had started consuming alcohol at that point, I started drinking late relative to my friend circles. I guess that's because of my religious parents who don't drink or smoke. According to them they never did so.

&amp;nbsp;

I relapsed last night with my friends from school, after a break of 27 days. This was a big deal for me since I had never truly stopped drinking since I started drinking in high school, which was 4 years ago. I think it is fair to say I did not have a week without alcohol in these 4 years. I always fancied a drink, I don't really recall any point where I thought it was a bad idea to drink. I had some problems because of my drinking attitude, I guess some of them were a big deal, but I think I always found a way to find a place for alcohol in my life. I like to blame my parents for this, I always thoughts drugs (including alcohol) in a way that demonizing them past the point they deserve. I realize blaming my parents will not get me anywhere though.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like this break taught me a lot of things, gained me a lot of perspectives, I learned how to see circumstances under a sober view. I also improved my self-trust, I know for a fact I can control alcohol now. I think this break had a lot of positive impacts on me, I might just take some breaks from time to time. I'm going to try being sober on weekdays and stick to drinking in Fridays and Saturdays.

I think I'm going to stop here, I might add some stuff later. Be safe fellas.",4.8403237833595005,5.621181788265307,5.4915306122448975,82.54467817896389,69.12755102040815,8.785871271585558,31.658555729984304,8.950670267944501,2.568336028257457,1559,65,307,27,26,505,191,392,0.069,0.813,0.11699999999999999,0.9586,3,0,21,0,0,0,54.0,0,0,5,3,14,11,0,0,19,0,25,21,0,2,4,58,53,13,0,2,9,3,2,4,4,3,9,1,0,0,16,7,19,5,16,12,0,2,11,2,1,0,19,6,58,9,47,29,9,63,1,0,3,0,20,23,0,13,36,200,74,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757187570975453,0.4014701596624562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042916865508555814,0.13396380980916714,0.17444201646654278,0.0,0.0364948773453553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047774323454884006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04480906121050661,0.0654288725608901,0.0,0.09133201968225806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060191241352365935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06922055854362548,0.11065505528414543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5782972293116377,0.062235790011338776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02713525886251152,0.038339166119878296,0.05152799770915792,0.0,0.049049962850455625,0.0,0.0,0.05884225224790966,0.12438719074142958,0.0,0.028038390683895062,0.0,0.06099951158515515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11823880757065545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340263897670153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06058264247623059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02949355704168464,0.13123542290318696,0.06053784605784102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03790604602509568,0.10487443864145184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13687533131538768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11386278048594176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12417211720051385,0.0,0.0,0.10072424460901014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17876999552799452,0.0,0.051230489910637236,0.0372054073380776,0.0,0.05606978907678182,0.0,0.15219580414420142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051351335244622695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057080642531464214,0.0,0.06108391986411785,0.03437996175449118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04267754086310485,0.0,0.2172523633339298,0.08553007576739524,0.0,0.055985583059943424,0.0,0.0,0.08878652164104506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15194093796442434,0.0,0.0,0.13460211628854227,0.0,0.0,0.06143499491438765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04035032683605426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03565345921553069,0.13754861540348431,0.05272679943853457,0.12781497841499315,0.06258642168876995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03643584807700278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08519551235507848,0.04304781337787796,0.0,0.04825238668706459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0517323315602192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10367787966261736
alcoholism,starchild198,2020/02/24,"Boyfriend is an alcoholic My boyfriend was sober for 7 years and that includes when I met him. He is so sweet and has been a really great guy. He started drinking again 6 months ago. At first he was fine just drinking beer and when we hung out with friends. But in the last month he is drinking alot of liquor and that's when things go south. He acts insane and I know he would hate to actually serve how he acts. 

It has now in the last 2 months getting to a point were a few times a week he is hiding liquor in his car. He comes in so fucked up then wants to deny it. A little backstory my oldest sister was a severe alcoholic and drug addict and she died 7 years ago. So this feels exceptionally rough and he is starting to remind me of her. I do love him alot and I have seen how wonderful he actually can be, but tonight has been rough.

Just looking for some advice.",2.5230524344569294,4.201270893258432,3.357101123595509,92.12965917602995,76.02247191011236,6.544419475655433,22.54082397003745,7.3011,0.5708482397003753,681,19,152,8,15,216,109,178,0.084,0.841,0.076,-0.0973,0,0,7,0,0,0,13.0,1,0,0,1,12,7,2,0,11,0,19,12,0,2,0,28,34,20,1,2,5,1,3,0,1,1,4,0,0,1,6,13,8,0,3,6,0,5,0,2,0,1,8,6,13,5,17,24,4,37,0,0,2,2,22,10,1,4,22,93,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.2691650179397974,0.15034476167440486,0.0,0.13476630167898732,0.24450186243181074,0.2947726099680103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11879923332300735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14313119200358185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40530464547199196,0.15993448167282628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06973260177854355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11730813040936368,0.0,0.0,0.10655069949485688,0.12749769741083422,0.07205348369727388,0.0,0.07837873726588764,0.0,0.0,0.1520487956554987,0.0,0.13655485777373816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361598424162733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0757929923809173,0.22483385990934746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382243536724121,0.0,0.0,0.11581159640094485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12447123359488213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3302408420260239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13037169900763465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835014968291327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1558016418082463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19523006901491832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09162280286697193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041777015063742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134424667179255,0.0,0.11062492688668556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14956000446967027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796893975497413,0.0,0.0,0.1776219968366256

i didn't think he'd be drinking today. i know it isn't my fault but i can't reach any friends and having trouble articulating to myself why my sharing a frustration about something else this morning was bad. i'm just so tired.

I sat in the dark from 4 am to 8 terrified my life was over. Turns out my daughter was fussy and my wife took her in our room and was worried she would sneek out. I still can't shake the terror of thinking I did something terrible. I'm a 31 year old binge drinker and I am really scared for the first time. I am really looking at my drinking and its dangerous and I am irresponsible.

alcoholism,LemsipAndPolice,2020/02/25,"My boyfriend promised me he wouldn't drink this week. We were at a friend's going away party.

He amended that to ""I won't write myself off but I can have a few""

I went to bed early because I have a really important day at uni ahead, and I need to get enough sleep.

He burst into my room at 1:30am, threw a full beer on the floor which I then had to clean up, then flopped onto my bed with his shoes on.

He was sprawled out in such a way that I couldn't fit on either side of him. He's a big man and I couldn't move him and he wouldn't wake up. I had all the lights in my room on and my roommates standing in the doorway scratching their heads. It took us an hour to move him.

alcoholism,jjschmidtzz,2020/02/25,"Any tapering help/suggestions would be welcome. Hi all, I'm a 25yo guy looking for any and all advice on tapering. My alcohol consumption has been steadily increasing this past year. 2 months ago, I moved to a new city and it increased rather steeply. I would say before I came to the conclusion that I needed to quit, I was at anywhere from 7-13 drinks a day. The majority of them would be within a 2-3 hour period after I got home from work and before going to bed. 

I've currently got my timeline laid out, and I've been reading up on how to safely taper, but I want to know if anyone has any tips or tricks for dealing with symptoms. I've been having to deal with shakes,  night sweats and trouble falling asleep, as well as some nausea. Is there anything that can help me sleep more soundly, like taking melatonin? Will anti acid tablets help with nausea at all? I know theres no real way to decrease the shakes besides just slowly going through the taper.

I'm planning on using exclusively beer to taper, and am planning on starting at 9 over the course of the day today, and then decreasing by 1 every day for the next week (A lot of cites say you can decrease it by 2 per day safely, but Web MD has got me all sorts of paranoid). Any and all advice is appreciated, I'm gunna head out and buy a bunch of smart water to replenish electrolytes as well as a bunch of veggies to make sure my body is getting nutrients during this coming week.",7.572045112781957,6.244558698245616,7.751390977443607,75.74723684210528,63.771929824561404,10.24812030075188,34.74310776942356,9.04235418022936,2.9232055137844615,1139,41,217,15,14,372,168,285,0.045,0.825,0.13,0.9742,1,0,3,1,0,0,30.0,0,1,1,5,7,12,1,2,14,0,20,10,5,3,6,45,40,19,0,7,6,0,0,1,0,4,2,3,2,1,6,16,4,2,3,3,1,10,1,4,2,0,8,5,15,8,45,26,13,43,0,0,1,0,11,12,0,5,21,132,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2160279402732968,0.0979830140696897,0.11812878847869646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30067160708303303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07728896221681998,0.0,0.0909612635917461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18811506664440591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12277997525309822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264231168159239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952165094726258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2851449038113545,0.22791440692689602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10828266741967624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931308906067142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057750214551834884,0.0,0.1256396959909424,0.0,0.2652159097833532,0.0,0.0,0.1094474816465681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11344126925015513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222687622589567,0.0,0.1108760767492384,0.0,0.10885516032490294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12149479378161325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05400204135134159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0928219455404086,0.0,0.0,0.0939732934916913,0.0,0.0,0.07378327644697899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822834789829437,0.11748169865729485,0.0,0.08196064141741256,0.0,0.1067558339963334,0.11755571343716628,0.10373003932930724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10551860188018147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11756806551818524,0.1105653703300058,0.12581355034210698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17580446532579813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11061528525102156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0782375659999326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041783609046262,0.11488866399294995,0.08310890800723661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477468948444983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09546714564677747,0.0,0.0,0.06519667692391026,0.08773790145140728,0.1773297538070002,0.0,0.1987693027914519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08047112979688152,0.0,0.0,0.2355636535508525,0.0,0.0,0.07118121081790639
alcoholism,ADAPdevelopment,2020/02/25,"Alcoholics in Recovery: We need your help LOOKING for addicts in RECOVERY who would like to test a new app as it evolves into an indispensable tool for addicts everywhere. The mission of this app is to help make recovery accessible to all addicts regardless of barriers like accessibility, insurance coverage, fear of breaching anonymity, lack of childcare, financial barriers, etc. It will always be completely FREE for addicts.

One key function of the app is the crisis call button which allows users to get in touch with a fellow addict anywhere at any any time. ADAP will offer an anonymous social network, the ability to plan/share events, meeting finders, sobriety tracker, and chat abilities. ADAP is not affiliated with any anonymous fellowship and is open to users with various addictions. 

The first feature that we are ready to test on ADAP is the CRISIS CALL feature.

alcoholism,lovecasualties,2020/02/25,"honest opinions please hi. i've never posted on this subreddit before, but i have something id like an opinion on. i'll try not to make it too long but anyways 
so i had a pretty bad addiction and problem with alcohol through ages 14-17. you may think no way, thats super young. but yeah, happens to the best of us. i used it to escape, and partied with shitty people, fucked up a lot of relationships and friendships along the years. heres where i am now, i have held the same job for a year, have my OWN apartment, paying real bills and haven't drank since September 2018. i'm proud of myself. i turned my life around for the best, and i don't associate with the people i drank with. 0 of them. my current boyfriend has helped me with this, being someone that actually supports and cares about me. we got together the month before i stopped drinking. anyways, his 21st birthday is coming up.. i want to drink a couple of beers. maybe some wine, just to relax. now i know my limits. i never want to go back to who i used to be. i know how easy it is to get addicted to something again, but i just want to have a good time for his 21st (st. patricks day btw) what are your opinions on this?

alcoholism,inkygreenmarker,2020/02/25,"Ending up in the same spot I decided sobriety is my only option and ever since my low points have felt lower. I’ve never felt more shame. 

I really thought I’d never sip on a drink again a week ago. I felt invigorated by the idea. It made me feel strong and I guess in some way made me feel I was the one in control, not booze and not even sobriety. So I did the thing where I tested with one beer at a bar. Now here a an at a brand new low knowing I couldn’t cut it even ONE week. I keep making things so hard on myself and it’s all alcohol based. I have so much going for me. I know people have gotten themselves out of similar cycles.

alcoholism,T3skynetrotm,2020/02/25,"Need Some Advice Hey everyone, I was just wondering what the best ways are to avoid hitting the drink ?

For reference I'm a 23 year old male and have been drinking 5-6 times a week (approximately 4-6 drinks each night).

I workout about 4 times a week also, I'm in pretty good shape and have good strength. I always tell myself that I'm done with the drink but around the 24 hour mark being sober, I can't resist the urge.

I know if I stopped drinking my health would be much better and I would have more money in my pocket. I try focusing on other things and keeping myself preoccupied but it doesn't really work.

Just wondering what you guys do to resist the urge and how some of you have beat your addiction.

Thanks.",5.189759129759132,5.650874300699303,5.624848484848485,83.03505050505049,68.23076923076923,8.873038073038073,26.378399378399376,8.841846274778883,1.7073564879564875,567,15,116,9,9,182,96,143,0.028999999999999998,0.8370000000000001,0.134,0.9253,1,1,5,0,0,0,15.0,0,3,0,5,6,7,0,1,9,0,15,7,0,1,0,26,25,10,0,4,5,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,6,8,5,3,4,6,1,0,2,1,0,0,3,0,15,6,10,17,6,15,0,0,0,0,7,5,0,5,9,73,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14186442282056924,0.0,0.1271646806342109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10406749241889084,0.10828126733332794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11584615943043705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13656679027108698,0.11509226168704452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331714697007415,0.0,0.637405087657806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12434787251008005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21829914874799394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12885235152635371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13832553207650616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12815501254689493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566838897610572,0.0,0.0,0.07151781677135176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09566289314628296,0.0964921368711367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12212121549460525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13655292808846556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13239227280341245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08336667570780534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10879720245515127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137421738507312,0.11980918894163503,0.0,0.0,0.0864547317855677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15176345913060946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835191709826579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10329369620864004,0.208770045960558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2822478611803023,0.0947385371350456,0.0,0.0,0.1848858176087503,0.0,0.0,0.08380152983326286

alcoholism,cmpppp,2020/02/25,"First time on here didnt know where to go Hi, this is my first time on reddit I dont know really what in doing so bare with me please.

I am engaged to an alcoholic. I dont know what to do anymore. He isnt abusive or anything just cant stop drinking. He drinks every night, to a point where he spends all of our money on beer. Even when we have no money he asks his friend to buy him beer. 
He doesnt have a job, he keeps quitting them. He doesnt do anything with his life. He keeps making false promises. 

Even when he has a job he still drinks every single day he's off. I just miss him and how nice and normal he is when hes sober. He cant go more than 1 week without drinking and it's making me rethink this whole relationship. When he drinks, I go into a different room until it's time to go to bed. 
I dont want to leave but honestly I'm at a point where I feel like I cant handle it anymore. The only thing holding me back is that he is amazing when he is sober, hes productive, holds a job and is a great person.

alcoholism,SearchingF0RAnswers,2020/02/25,"Have any of you gone to rehab? How did you afford it? I'm getting so discouraged. I've been trying and working on stopping for like 18 months now. But I keep failing. And I'm so tired. 

I mostly do ok, make it 3, 4, 5 months without anything, keep my appointments, take my antabuse, get my shot every month, and then... something different triggers me every time. I get overwhelmed with life, or relationships, or family, get depressed, anxious.... something and I cant fight it. I can push it away for a week or two, but eventually I still end up slipping. 

I'm a week sober, again, for the umpteenth time, and I really am motivated to never, ever touch the stuff again, but this isnt the first time I've ever been this motivated, but this is the first time that I'm thinking maybe I need more help. 

I've been looking into inpatient programs in my area, but my problem is I lost my job after my last relapse (before this one), and I dont have private health insurance anymore. My credit is garbage, and I dont have the money for self pay. Medicaid doesn't cover inpatient care, just outpatient and detox, which I've been doing, I've done, and I need more. But $15,000+ for a 30 day program is astronomical. 

I've called everyone I can think of. State funded rehab is on a minimum 6 month waitlist, most of the private places only have like 5 grant/scholarship beds, and they're on multiple waitlists.

I've called literally everyone, up to and including different charities (To write love on her arms, 10000 beds, etc) and I cannot figure out how anyone manages to afford this. It's getting so discouraging and I dont know where else to turn. I've called literally every rehab within a 100 mile radius of me, and I dont want to go further than that because I'd like my daughter to be able to visit me.

Help! Anyone know of any other grants, charities, or places I can turn? I feel like I've exhausted all my options, and it really sucks that I want help, NEED help, and desperate for help, and am being told ""maybe in 6 months."" This shit is ruining my life, and I seriously want to be done.",4.588847758081336,5.502634661800492,5.781844803614877,79.75376824817519,69.77858880778591,8.985783802572122,29.763729579423014,9.23628265651192,2.5043423010079944,1630,62,319,32,28,545,203,411,0.11599999999999999,0.733,0.151,0.9679,5,0,2,0,2,0,78.0,0,2,0,7,14,21,3,1,11,1,35,12,2,6,4,65,69,34,0,7,12,1,2,4,0,0,9,0,2,1,18,21,0,5,8,0,4,4,10,13,0,4,10,3,37,8,37,56,6,49,0,7,1,1,19,18,2,7,30,191,55,10,0.07627226745818914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10373551471813136,0.0,0.0,0.0861659521899642,0.07564159434887772,0.10666268565063276,0.0,0.06276557729972554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07166030600648048,0.0,0.0,0.046494866308920316,0.0,0.06490208188897605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2336475384766261,0.0,0.07776465995378029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04918930266327785,0.0,0.06569319219888999,0.0,0.0,0.15937657153839646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15610602155074804,0.3575621176591625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06371569241772206,0.0,0.06755459015957815,0.0,0.08506373987924402,0.0,0.137985265171305,0.19278802478833704,0.14576284026502814,0.0,0.0,0.07190270570161073,0.0,0.0385655501520766,0.05448892311204997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297543034724596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.199245558625784,0.0,0.04334728729158222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08107385365603398,0.0,0.0,0.2556184656341409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07568845644831534,0.13558859163167836,0.0,0.0,0.0838344870058074,0.06217207790235419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077467162892912,0.14905110887611586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06404949500345429,0.0,0.08326018985905473,0.0,0.06883869924915527,0.0,0.050912330792204426,0.0,0.15325148870256142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30439898102624696,0.0,0.0,0.1696647596335665,0.058825874699894976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05168406237146575,0.05800849636195617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15937657153839646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07298225916276736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772393519348853,0.0,0.0,0.08188787115083318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07956860932233098,0.0,0.0782923864838962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11743623563031078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06091113131701425,0.06376703084110505,0.0,0.0,0.08731349825951497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05734725292775425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09774437849605976,0.0,0.0,0.17789989008078866,0.08766375133938369,0.0,0.07288142013251409,0.0,0.05178386296098295,0.16592464972311502,0.07450692251272732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349620784794455,0.0,0.1223620245654166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735237440474829,0.0,0.05552711910788286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Mbalife81,2020/02/25,"23 year old brother, alcohol and a downward spiral. Awful everything. Tonight I confronted my 23 year old brother about his drinking problem. He's a binge drinker when he drinks, and has threatened suicide at least once while drunk while also becoming violent. The last two weeks he's missed work because he got drunk the night before, and he's very close to losing his job. He has a family that depends on him but he seems to have chosen alcohol over himself and everybody that cares about him. Tonight I confronted him; I asked him to meet with me to talk about this but he refused. I went to his house and he was home with his family. The discussion became heated; I approached it us caring for his well-being. But we set some hard lines, I go with him next week to a chemical dependency assessment, or the next time he's drunk, I'm calling the cops so he can detox in the holding cell. He was very defensive which led to him being angry. I spoke passionately with a raised tone of voice. He wouldn't invite me into his home, so we spoke on his front porch him riding the front door to create a barrier between us. He was defiant the entire time, minimizing his behavior and saying he doesn't have a problem but is going tomorrow to get antidepressants. 

This was just awful, I hate this stress as I already lead a stressful life as a full-time grad student and working full-time in a hospital setting. I don't know what to do; I feels easier to decide, hey he's an adult, play stupid games, win stupid prizes and such. This just makes me sick to see him spiral downward.

alcoholism,astrozoe_,2020/02/25,"Tomorrow I'm a week sober Tomorrow marks one week sober for me! I know that's not a long time considering I see people posting 1 year or 5 years on here. But I don't think I've gone this long without a drink in about 4 years. I made it through the weekend. Went bowling sober for the first time since middle school probably. And I kicked ass! The alley had an open bar and as much as I wanted to sit my ass down and order a drink, I kept strong and just had a good time drinking my diet Dr Pepper and enjoyed the games we played.

alcoholism,Lather,2020/02/26,"Moderation rather than quitting? I know in the AA circle this is a super taboo subject, but has anyone tried and succeeded in moderating rather than abstinence?

I'm not asking this because I WANT to carry on drinking, but I've spent several years being told total abstinence is the only way if you're an alcoholic. This has lead to me abstaining maybe for a week, sometimes two weeks then inevitably caving in and drinking. With that drink comes intense guilt because I've 'ruined' my sobriety, and what do I do to handle that guilt? Of course I start drinking again. It's been an endless cycle for the past 5 years.

For the first time I decided to seek outside help for my alcoholism! I met with a really lovely (and eccentric) doctor today who explained that for some people, moderation can be better rather than totally quitting. I explained my situation and he said, this time, don't tell yourself you can never drink again. Say 'I will only drink once every two weeks'. If I can manage that, then great, if I can't then we can work on abstinence. 

Just wondering if anyone else who has been an alcoholic for several years had any luck with moderation? 

Side question: Is there a discord for alcoholics that isn't AA based? The one I'm in is very helpful but they also seem very close minded on a lot of things.",6.215673076923075,7.158903753036437,6.62576670040486,75.05500632591095,66.12550607287449,9.737753036437248,31.63183198380567,9.827888789773867,3.1205629554655863,1045,40,182,22,16,339,141,247,0.034,0.8170000000000001,0.149,0.9854,0,0,10,0,0,0,27.0,1,1,1,8,8,9,0,2,13,0,22,12,0,1,3,41,38,16,0,8,12,0,0,0,0,1,5,2,0,0,14,11,10,2,7,6,1,2,5,3,2,4,7,2,17,6,26,28,4,30,0,1,0,1,18,9,0,10,18,125,31,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3956163327884908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07400941749371093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06293480620796305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12942135524720466,0.09482484495423868,0.0,0.0,0.0865185020356505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11283099751393455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184987499464047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0797206311509623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947252833258134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.543962132442258,0.0,0.0,0.07731074098607897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07797443342483551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07872002144952166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10203286348189372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12406396125048352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05086114632573663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07867974062466596,0.08352684629995111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09297541703807413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09344560174598522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07137758046145251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09855902192460493,0.06271191613068547,0.14077159541261508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08834612386703368,0.0641601033085331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036732811053754,0.1968692286289277,0.0,0.0,0.059287669608552813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08803293213456954,0.07359670614138293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08425087473546286,0.0,0.2091024474129178,0.0,0.0,0.10402616446115548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09153087331046517,0.0,0.06550490220420062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08088973641525872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06148379470190251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10792923847801042,0.0,0.08772327845884527,0.08843216452271023,0.0,0.06283301122097876,0.0,0.18080900228745414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527211402122004,0.054586334471899145,0.07345911878420625,0.22270570471924944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10036275165888443,0.06737496776945745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1787907711779107
alcoholism,CatLady131313,2020/02/26,"How can I stop drinking? Hi I have PTSD diagnosis I've been in/out therapy ongoing but flashbacks and what ifs haunt me 

Is there any medications that have helped people?

I've been drinking daily 9 months...I have been to detox but I find my symptoms of anxiety and rasing thoughts come so much harder 

But I'm definitely feeling my stomach is in pain daily I honestly can't tell what is from stress and what is from alcohol use 

I have cut down to drinking after 5 pm apposed to morning to night

I have expressed my concerns to my doctors numerous times that my anxiety is unbearable and I'll go into straight panic attack and they just say you have an addictive personality and cant help you so it's a vicious cycle of trying to keep my anxiety down and coming off alcohol, I resorted to lying and saying I've been sober for months but I'm labeled as an addict forever now

alcoholism,methreewe,2020/02/26,"Going on 96 hours sober; requesting suggestions to get over this hump I've been treated before for alcoholism. My rehab stint about 10 months ago was after months of +/- 750 ml of 90 proof alcohol per day. I have had an extended relapse with daily intake of about half that.  I am about to hit 96 hours since I stopped drinking.  I am doing this on my own while trying to keep my regular work schedule.  

I am experiencing extreme depression. My productivity has completely ground to a halt and I think it's the depression that is hanging me up. I was expecting my withdrawal problems to peak at 72 hours. 

If you have experience with techniques to cope at this point I'd appreciate any suggestions.

alcoholism,lvontrapqueen,2020/02/26,"Withdrawal Timelines I’m just wondering how long it takes for withdrawal symptoms to kick in. I know it can vary based on age, genetics, consumption patterns, length of alcohol abuse, fitness, whether or not you have been prescribed meds to aid in withdrawal, etc.

That being said, is there a certain point in time - in terms of hours - when you *generally* know your withdrawal will not be severe (or you may not have any withdrawal at all)? I have read varying timelines, but most suggest you’ll be feeling it within 6-12 hours.  How accurate is this?

I’m just curious what your personal experiences have been.

alcoholism,moderndayworrier,2020/02/26,"Please allow me to introduce myself... 
Hi everyone.  I’m new here and I am what you would call a functional alcoholic.  I’ve been gradually cutting down for 5 years now and am now 7 months sober, with 3 binges prior to that in the year 2019.  That was the year I decided I really needed to make a more significant change and that even drinking once a week or once a month is too much for me.  I will never not be a heavy drinker and have decided that abstinence is the best path for me.

Going back to 2015, I was getting into a pattern where I was drinking 4-5 days a week.   I can remember finishing my first half marathon and then getting drunk that night to celebrate.  And then drinking a case of beer the next day, knowing I had to work the next day.  I’d started to find ways to sneak it in on weeknights and could function the next day.

By that point I was up from 2 days a week just a year prior.  I’m quite regimented and routinized and always believed and loved by what an old friend had told me:  ‘keep it to the weekends’. And I mostly had don’t that but 5 years ago it was beginning to get bad.  Even when I was only drinking 2 days a week, it was always heavy drinking and almost always alone.  Once I discovered drinking alone, in my early 30’s when I moved to a town where I didn’t know anyone, that’s when I began drinking almost exclusively alone.  And I’m able to hide it very well, being quite mild mannered.  I’m like Clark Kent and my alter ego isn’t superman, he’s a closet alcoholic.

I have more to say but I’m new to reddit and social media and don’t quite know what is an acceptable level of information to get started with.  My wife told me I should start journaling and maybe this is my way of doing that.  I live quite a lonely life (a result of the drinking, really) and I’m still processing what my life can look like sober.  I’m here because it would be great to have some support and people to talk to.  I have a tendency to do most things alone and this is something I don’t want to do alone.  Maybe I can be helpful to other people going through similar things to me.  Maybe there will be times when I need someone to reach out to.  Maybe this is the step that will get me to AA, I don’t know.  I need help to stop romanticizing or getting nostalgic for the good times, or mourning the loss of my former best friend.  Turns out my best friend was a lying SOTB!  My real motivation also has to do with how I feel the next day(s) after drinking.  I’m grouchy and really quite crappy to my family.  I don’t like living the lie anymore and I want to model the best behaviour I can for my child.

Everything in my life seems to be screaming for me to stop.  After one of the 3 binges I had last year I was walking through an alley and saw something shiny.  I was going to leave it.  My subconscious hoped that it was an Alcoholics Anonymous ring...I don’t even know if there is such a thing.  The shiny thing turned out to be a ring with the serenity prayer on it.  Think what you want, but putting it on every day gives me strength!  We see what we want to see...

I now look back on what was/has been a 30 year drinking career.  That’s a long time!  I really like what I’ve seen here so far and you seem like a good bunch of people.

alcoholism,bluepil,2020/02/26,"Did you experience the effect of still getting drunk even after stopping drinking 3 days ago? I have been getting basically so drunk for over a year. I have been always thinking about stopping drinking. But, it is never easy. I just could not resist the temptation. I am trying now to form a new habit which is drinking only during the weekend to socialize with people.
Since two weeks, I realized that I have to take my issue with Alcohol Addition seriously. So, I stopped drinking as I used to during the week days. I usually drink only when invited by some friends, old classmates, and old coworkers too.
Here is what I want to know. Even if I did not drink for like three days, especially at night or even during some discussions, I feel I am somehow drunk. Also, my voice slows down greatly. Did this happen to any of you during the process of gradually stopping drinking alcohol? Thanks in advance.",4.958493506493507,7.275020836363637,5.597943722943723,75.91977272727273,70.93939393939394,8.350649350649352,32.391774891774894,9.04235418022936,3.1887229437229445,718,34,118,15,14,232,106,165,0.127,0.8290000000000001,0.044000000000000004,-0.858,0,0,9,0,0,0,22.0,0,2,0,2,14,5,0,0,7,0,14,12,0,2,1,26,24,9,0,3,6,0,1,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,5,4,12,4,5,11,0,1,3,1,0,2,5,2,17,4,21,18,3,28,0,0,0,0,5,4,0,5,24,89,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833836197759361,0.2130022999534112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0796942635470042,0.0829211471852415,0.0,0.0,0.06776898403021814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07956660423616413,0.0,0.0,0.19280816655913868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6833694077353792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19746404866410397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09748195210511032,0.0,0.0,0.05038868625608405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699339520219424,0.0,0.10413150495115893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098702595986858,0.0,0.0,0.08812480417517002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10401418469759613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05476791652806128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04868651900247569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.076860268615489,0.09624765676304388,0.0,0.09351969674769348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2091428319497365,0.0,0.0,0.15158460915732136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06908839922578439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08243584860213785,0.0,0.0,0.10158597255584753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07958480751170878,0.3332649888684618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0749283421092156,0.0,0.0,0.0917491606354326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06385505719368924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06765936991899804,0.0,0.09734869404418513,0.0,0.0,0.08607013520848089,0.109756173352621,0.0,0.05877924557152631,0.0,0.15987485310524036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06417471055506926

alcoholism,booksandowls,2020/02/26,"So my husband recently came to me and said he’s an alcoholic. I am really proud of him. At the same time, I am disturbed at the amount of lying and hiding it he has done - I had no idea. I mean, I knew he liked to drink but it appeared to me he only had a few drinks on fridays and Saturdays. Evidently he waits until I go to bed every night and gets hammered.

He said he wants to get sober and that his addiction is at the root of every problem in his life, which makes sense now that I know. He’s gained weight, his mental health has STEEPLY declined, he never feels good, he struggles to wake up in the morning and get to work on time...We have been fighting for years about what I have perceived to be his laziness and inability to improve his lifestyle, so this is a bit of a revelation.

I don’t really have any questions. I guess I’m just looking for support and maybe advice if you have any.",3.5398035117056854,4.4458330054347845,4.744130434782614,86.25906354515051,72.20652173913044,7.618060200668896,27.74080267558529,7.882392219407189,1.552229598662208,699,25,149,9,13,231,115,184,0.125,0.797,0.078,-0.7913,0,0,3,0,2,0,20.0,0,1,0,3,5,8,1,2,8,0,16,8,1,2,1,28,35,13,0,3,3,1,2,1,0,0,4,2,1,0,7,9,4,1,7,2,0,3,3,4,0,0,8,5,20,4,25,26,4,19,0,0,1,0,22,8,0,4,9,94,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16233747617648886,0.0,0.14551635217983538,0.0,0.15914302904611907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20253229934711356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16257475413946876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1703171429305384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15239000631804345,0.0,0.2917566819788135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2509317537204425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07529503824326515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2334031574403145,0.0,0.08463085944557025,0.12490140993294553,0.0,0.0,0.16404478731857894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1582878731792514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16810498861419906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08183885462952342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10518186686818963,0.07275151591752879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250496662625007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09940078331402677,0.0,0.14960342400399218,0.16221023787864527,0.0,0.0,0.15006958046052998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11485111628787735,0.0,0.0,0.1397450433085249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11325527406673368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14248991582049458,0.0,0.0,0.16681697512301705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19079534477430185,0.0,0.14703391758152734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2833012960199888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15567651250305115,0.0,0.0,0.1689850468341405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17366508417855908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783292187309145,0.0,0.0,0.18133628052472375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10841065511264993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09589528214601904
alcoholism,Verdoofd,2020/02/26,"Looking for Dutch people who are addicted Hi all,

Recently I started working as a researcher for a series of documentaries about addiction for the Dutch public broadcasting (NPO3). That's why I'm looking for people who are addicted, or who recently stopped using.

We intend to follow a few people for several months, so we can (hopefully) give viewers a deeper understanding of what addiction actually means. Why do you choose to use, again and again, even when you don't intend to? And why is it so hard to stay sober?

In the end the viewer (hopefully) gets a personal insight in the lives of several people, and their relentless drive to numb themselves. The documentaries should present an unprejudiced representation of people who are addicted. We want to show that addicts are also plain people, although their lives sometimes maybe seems to be different.With these documentaries we hope to nuance the general knowledge about addiction, and to fight stigmatization.

The coming two months we are researching. We will try to speak with as many people as we can, to get a better idea of what is happening right now. So right now I'm just curious about your stories. The first contacts will stay private.

If you want to know more about these documentaries, or when you want to contact me, you can send me a PM.",7.218017241379311,8.87146528448276,7.103793103448279,69.95801724137935,64.25862068965517,10.8,34.75862068965517,10.820120047756994,4.227762068965517,1054,47,168,29,16,335,126,232,0.038,0.903,0.059000000000000004,0.4203,1,0,0,0,1,0,31.0,7,6,2,3,16,6,1,0,16,0,16,8,0,4,1,39,39,17,0,8,4,0,1,0,0,3,8,1,0,1,11,13,0,1,8,1,0,4,1,2,0,2,0,6,18,4,33,35,3,25,0,0,4,0,28,4,0,7,15,119,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.07986104848943555,0.6245004106312523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06544497149040264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07237812317564123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07049527762213481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0724832385035596,0.0,0.0,0.0540525271624671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06961045950571919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08551284709170888,0.07850545007784138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236813592536323,0.0,0.07330982398282722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2438476409543145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09238394423003114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044975442098836735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14452703499206007,0.0,0.13744483717246542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08296981252092762,0.08221620603732115,0.08914441917076507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13064292975412378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3971480105952104,0.07145685956214183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16160821107991172,0.0,0.0,0.13977659951857455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07450127675403465,0.0,0.18490489687578887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809388263973849,0.0,0.05792460746768902,0.17445457894857055,0.0,0.06841934640120569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055561910460415885,0.0,0.0799427991776595,0.08519514085600642,0.0,0.1413616813604617,0.0,0.0,0.144808642910178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.221535328756214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059578267120040926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,dogdemon4ever,2020/02/26,"My husband finally admitted to be he’s got a drinking problem, now what? How can I be supportive! I’ve known for years being together for 7 years and married for almost 4 and he’s finally admitted it to me he has a drinking problem after losing 100lbs from a year ago. He’s going to try to go to rehab but he’s afraid about what to do say to his job and to get the money together for rehab. I need advice please alcoholism runs in his family. His younger brother too is struggling, but it’s the biggest sigh of relief in my mind because my husband finally owned up to it. What do I do? I’m more of an emotional binge drinker and I don’t pick up a drink unless I’m in a social setting.

alcoholism,truecrimeaddicted,2020/02/26,"Need Some Advice Hi guys, 

Looking for some guidance and advice. Hoping the community can help and am here humbly looking for any input. I'm in my mid-40s, drink a pint of vodka a night and legitimately seeking a way to stop altogether. I've been doing this for about 4 or 5 years now. Here's the thing: I have a GREAT life, wonderful job, amazing husband--really nothing to complain about. But this is in my way. I've tried AA (not into the God/higher power thing--no offense), and Smart Recovery, but nothing's really taking. I'm a HIGHLY functioning alcoholic--you cannot tell when I'm drunk and I literally get up each morning and do \~3000m in the pool each day. I've been blotto drunk but people just don't realize. Very dangerous. I'm specifically talking about tapering down, as I've tried cold turkey in the past and had mini seizures. Any advice there? I'm serious about stopping and am open to any advice whatsoever. Thank you in advance for any input! I wholeheartedly appreciate that reddit exist for just such a thing.",4.3552347715736035,6.300521842639598,5.743854695431472,75.81192417512692,71.69035532994924,8.579822335025383,28.556154822335024,9.188382445141503,2.6516195431472074,821,32,145,18,16,276,120,197,0.055999999999999994,0.809,0.135,0.9327,2,0,3,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,0,2,12,9,2,0,11,0,12,4,0,0,0,27,25,14,0,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,5,12,3,2,2,5,0,1,3,4,1,0,3,3,6,5,22,22,4,21,0,0,2,0,7,10,0,5,8,81,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5051675151259805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3515506568893717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08334913896264197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12660604448297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06752259070339524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424876087757969,0.0,0.1279679662506773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08662687966691976,0.27309841219620873,0.0,0.1283645285601621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1282508052119258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128606772737333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170581801524654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09582985772716676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12128302974516593,0.0,0.2480186226596092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12337424928447525,0.08959877619099922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08279448389597803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21610093361938176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971724316996579,0.1038782547635727,0.11296149811928025,0.11898687191493301,0.0,0.0,0.2575840347876954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17549101761020008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10663657441218052,0.0,0.20516946836832034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1401553186495768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322635337597845

alcoholism,EvilOverseer,2020/02/26,"Can support groups do more harm than good? Ok so I have a brother whos a fairly heavy drinker when he can afford it. Every payday the first thing he does is go to the liquor store, buy a 12 pack and drink it, then a few hours later cab back to the liquor store for more. This can repeat upto 3 times a night until hes broke. My family that is familiar with his drinking (myself, my sister, and my mother) have stopped doing anything that will help him get alcohol in any way shape or form. For example we no longer lend him cash as we know where that will go, we don't give him lifts to the liquor store, etc. Now this is where the support group comes in, I'm not sure exactly what is said there although he has pridefully told me on more than one occasion that the group seems to boil down to patting each other on the back and making each other feel better about relapsing with regularity.

Last night my brother got paid so you guessed it, binge drinking going on as I type! Well today my sister called me and we got talking and my concerns about the 'support' group came forth, she went on to inform me how when drunk he has texted her to put her down because his group says his life would be perfect if it wasn't for her. He has said similar things to my mother, and on one occasion where I dared to stand up for my mom he said as much to me. What I'm gathering from him is that this group is enabling him where we have stopped, he gets to be the victim and we (his family) are the victimizers. I'm at wits end and can not take it much longer as I live with him, I have my own problems (severe depression) that require counseling for me to work through and he keeps adding to them to the point where half my sessions are working through what he keeps dumping on me.

My question is that is this a normal situation for support groups? Do they normally make things worse before improving the situation? I mean I'm glad he's taking steps to deal with his problem but between the books they convince him to buy, the group itself, and the counselor he sees maybe once a month nothing is changing.",8.761948431685273,6.120974131578951,8.089633173843701,78.4252099946837,62.46889952153111,11.202764486975012,35.662413609782035,9.150863307647796,2.8638081871345027,1649,52,343,20,18,518,215,418,0.057,0.89,0.054000000000000006,0.3477,1,0,5,0,0,0,35.0,6,1,3,8,17,21,3,0,22,1,33,10,0,3,3,52,70,25,0,6,5,7,1,0,0,3,2,4,0,0,25,24,9,5,6,8,7,8,5,8,1,4,10,6,51,13,51,55,11,49,0,2,1,0,67,19,0,5,20,229,76,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09464180071662437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06022262372527296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07287586618510768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13619160358669802,0.0,0.05398426655494435,0.0,0.07535651926357094,0.0,0.0,0.07832254551598468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09042784002018492,0.10128700701797992,0.0,0.0,0.09368285021261752,0.07628506167288737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09129963220063383,0.07627506174439028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749789167521139,0.0,0.0,0.26026001188132897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07843629397607302,0.0,0.09876582023681478,0.0,0.0,0.07461411653224508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16696960928233748,0.0,0.04477769492689878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07532757335796994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925360255928254,0.08495311037636781,0.15098902507007986,0.07427843003210392,0.14165619069292892,0.0,0.09755685915408044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059358705511588276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087212004144981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15742922291293274,0.0,0.0,0.048669279560335406,0.07218676581314366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625512869951527,0.0,0.0,0.07819852726069013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182265937989182,0.0,0.08896863108598575,0.09646585904217056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371831235518106,0.07068632318068048,0.0,0.13020095691601016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662117733866771,0.17353649813824806,0.08497399675740254,0.0,0.0,0.09431160989807577,0.12001867824139865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08371613874102699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1694765054811641,0.0,0.08902546710417228,0.09920546950986713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527174293595523,0.07042504789362793,0.0,0.0,0.07056943254516072,0.08062007390557284,0.0,0.10004557707677893,0.0,0.0,0.1990862906362572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480772680352078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4019792565826162,0.08346507061230297,0.0,0.13316951457291284,0.07117973955979044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17650243116500325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05163900796276755,0.0,0.08394283400376851,0.08462117054376132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0702933898789321,0.0,0.0,0.07962447167044095,0.08209435353329621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1289428720595326,0.0,0.09024838792594987,0.06290921584414143,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Telstad,2020/02/27,"Am I on the road to become an alcoholic? If i take a beer, its really hard not to go to the fridge and get a second, then a third and so on. 

Im a big guy, so i dont really get drunk from 3-4 beers  or anything. I just enjoy having something good to drink while i game, or is out with friends. 

But i see that i drink twice as fast and twice the amount than my friends if we go for a pub quiz or something. I just feel thirsty. The only negative feeling i get is the price (beer in Norwegian bars is expensive) 

At home i have quit buying regular beer 4.5% alcohol and switched to light beer 2.5%. 

I usually have some in the fridge. This week; monday to thursday i have consumed 12 light beers. So an average of 3 a night while gaming. 

When the fridge got empty tonight i felt like i wanted more. 

Right now i dont feel like i have a problem, but the craving scared me.",2.253736263736265,3.3750154725274726,3.7437362637362632,91.37626373626377,75.5934065934066,7.397802197802199,24.538461538461537,7.957251820313856,1.0914021978021982,664,21,154,10,14,220,109,182,0.065,0.848,0.087,0.1839,0,0,12,0,0,0,25.0,1,0,0,1,7,8,0,1,17,0,11,12,0,0,0,24,24,19,0,4,10,0,5,2,2,0,2,0,1,1,3,7,12,0,4,13,3,2,4,2,0,4,2,8,19,6,18,22,3,23,0,0,1,0,6,9,0,6,14,97,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320135346069182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12325494900036688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16541859307283308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35107858855570484,0.2934518304481193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22719753987761435,0.10700179506339057,0.14381085477087255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2314370053608523,0.0,0.2347592635023338,0.0,0.17024515392935233,0.12562710516784456,0.11979155427871367,0.0,0.0,0.14830426970663182,0.0,0.0,0.1341721224432869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15024005434251916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.161786489280814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14634842546930674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14055698219763912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391330356985567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433178028154261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15930787840144545,0.0,0.0,0.19190389328963056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12791002628587408,0.0,0.0,0.14995441420803207,0.0,0.11935407789521513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2306136238385609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126147968203648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16495986450454167,0.0,0.08834324383746944,0.0,0.12014328351806627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Middleflan7,2020/02/27,"Is my dad an alcoholic or an angerholic? Maybe I’m being gaslit to second guess myself. For many years my dad has denied he is an alcoholic because he doesn’t drink every day. On average twice a week, and I think he only has one or two mixed drinks. Despite the seemingly small quantity, it is obvious when he drinks. His face and attitude change and many conflicts arise. He is prone to get in arguments with (by putting people down) and swear at them, etc after he drinks. There’s just a change in the vibe and it’s joticeable after a life of dealing with it. He doesn’t even have to say anything to anyone but we will know because of his mannerisms. 

When I’ve told him he has an alcohol problem, he denies it. I know the truth, really, he’s quite obviously an alcoholic to me, because I know he can’t go without it. I once emptied his liquor cabinets when I was fed up and after he freaked out about it he was better for a short time before he re stocked them. Then the cycle continues.

It’s  insane to see how he uses drinking as an outlet for
The anger he keeps cultivating. His worse addiction is anger and alcohol is just a side note. 

I’m thinking of going to al-anon because it’s too much to cope with now without skills and reacting badly to it just spirals situations worse. I guess I’m wondering if I woild he out of place there sharing this when it’s not even really alcohol. Alcohol is just a trigger. It’s

alcoholism,hardcorechim,2020/02/27,"Should I try the Sinclair Method Over the last two years, my drinking had increased a lot. I went from drinking every couple of weeks to drinking most days of the week without being to moderate. November of 2019 I drank so much that I blacked out and apparently tried to jump out of moving car and wound up in an inpatient hospital with a .35 ABV. My wife was extremely supportive and we agreed no more drinking. I went 50 days before drinking again, and now I'm at 55 days since drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

I still have  cravings, but only when things get hard in life. Nothing like before. I enjoy a good beer, and I would love to find a way to drink in moderation in social settings, vacation, etc, but I'm afraid to bring this method up to my wife after all that shes been through. She's right when she says every time I take and break and then try to moderate it never works. Maybe the Sinclair Method can make me a normal casual drinker again? What say you? Any experience with it?",5.698508771929827,6.314128447368425,5.738684210526317,82.11995614035091,67.15789473684211,8.85964912280702,30.570175438596486,8.841846274778883,2.3070175438596485,775,28,151,12,12,244,125,190,0.049,0.8590000000000001,0.091,0.8372,1,0,12,0,0,0,24.0,1,1,0,1,7,7,0,1,10,0,9,12,0,1,2,24,20,13,0,3,3,2,1,1,0,2,2,2,0,0,7,12,9,0,1,9,0,7,3,1,0,1,6,4,18,6,28,11,7,38,0,0,1,1,11,11,0,2,18,97,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10910204762616657,0.12235438929314114,0.06847546124888544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17136657606360886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11141613944938956,0.0,0.19481815061299884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6904933882023718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11230057207723797,0.0,0.0,0.16967829460673045,0.0,0.0,0.09849818068488024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203261045767312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0526085268512491,0.0,0.0,0.0844574587200672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902021620055462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207915529668137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07112324179437894,0.049194065589216976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08560654834486456,0.0908803835536436,0.0,0.06721411357961264,0.0,0.10116078764828323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10702192444315824,0.07402177145703266,0.0,0.07766152053883613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0986588678678415,0.0966187333296572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658242320447985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08599223671108708,0.0,0.1601520272510898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329522475883143,0.0,0.0,0.10264498467435393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041446217251899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11426650527776365,0.0,0.0,0.07570945411037924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06689670557866675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05871555687802856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2050941133017356,0.0,0.0983635334370638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07992631335136663,0.1615415143835955,0.0,0.0,0.18668893437010567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706554789989237,0.0,0.07330652579428527,0.0,0.0,0.07153022079184995,0.0,0.12235438929314114,0.06484371823860645
alcoholism,not_a_bug_a_feature,2020/02/27,"It's only a matter of time til I get fired I'm a web developer and I can pretty regularly work from home. However, I have this terrible habit of doing shots throughout the day while I'm on the clock.  I drink pretty regularly and it takes a good bit now a days for me to get really wasted.  Yesterday I had no scheduled meetings and figured I could do a couple rounds while I worked.  My manager pings me and says I need to join a call.  Oh Christ.  I'm quite a few shots deep and I would be amazed if they couldn't tell.

I was sending e-mails, interacting in group chats and this morning I woke up terrified of what I might have said.  It's just before 5am and I've been in a panic for the past 3 hours.  I finally got the courage to remote into my work computer and read everything. 

For the most part, everything seems okay.  There was one thing I was pretty adamant about being right when I clearly was not, but I could play that off as confusion.  I'm finally starting to calm down a little.

I need to stop this.  I just bought a house, it's not healthy.  I don't know how to stop.",1.5868601190476177,3.501079084821427,3.4253571428571448,89.50297619047623,79.58035714285714,7.1238095238095225,22.273809523809533,8.11559375814309,1.0807880952380953,841,26,186,16,21,282,138,224,0.126,0.7709999999999999,0.10300000000000001,-0.7788,1,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,1,4,7,9,0,2,15,1,19,1,0,1,1,32,35,16,0,7,6,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,10,9,1,2,3,4,1,1,5,3,0,1,10,4,24,6,23,18,4,29,1,0,1,0,10,10,0,5,18,116,34,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11183456739643606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14348407849545916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13420150596234273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2098672872679884,0.14542130726447422,0.0,0.16951888826279465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12874827607830813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2362359526237729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879433752483546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13733020701981888,0.0,0.0,0.11023460439397616,0.10511405622226752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13183184419039046,0.0,0.12942897111816462,0.15164893660517145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222875841821882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317242285242289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394231162575976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19490268461648136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08905823339366661,0.09995604003974204,0.0,0.15420108834651905,0.0,0.14232246866796372,0.1254617974418136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40112505892044137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13978863023998075,0.13146241372847156,0.0,0.08419540404987745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11223780988034322,0.12501702866216682,0.10451590442374092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196460661507363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302459929264546,0.0,0.0,0.21975745925899115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09881663324021582,0.0,0.11487285781238242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0873141577603788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07663605183379278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28704093135979514,0.0,0.0,0.09336186182606317,0.0,0.0,0.0

I felt fine, but the nurses at the detox center kinda freaked out when I told them my BAC level. I had to stay 26 hours to blow zeros when it was my first time in detox.

alcoholism,Jman231023,2020/02/27,"Drinking problem, abstinence vs moderation? Earlier this month, drank entirely too much while out with wife’s friends, after a stressful day at work at the hospital. Wife drove us home, once at home, we got into an argument which ended in me calling her a bad name. She left the house at that point. We spent some time apart over the next few weeks, and decided to work on this together, and moved all back into our home. However, she fully thinks I have a drinking problem, one In which moderation isn’t an option for her, basically because she is scared of this happening over again. And to that point, I feel like this has happened 3-4 times a year over the past 2 years or so. My drinking habit, honestly 2-3 nights a week, 4-6 beers typically, that oddball night every 3-4 months of drinking in excess, where the night before is a little fuzzy, nothing outrageous as far as any legal trouble, financial trouble etc. Have noticed that usually the excess drinking occurs when we are out in a group setting. I truly feel like that drinking is not the problem, but I have agreed to abstain at this time, and seeing a licensed counselor for evaluation soon. Can any one give me insight on what to expect? I have done all of the online self exams, for example the CAGE, AUDIT, MAST. They all end up saying I’m not an alcoholic, but have a moderate drinking problem. Have tried to cut back before, around September last year and this was the first time things got out of control since then. I feel like if I can talk with a counselor that, possibly they can show me a system that works for me, and with cutting back my wife will feel at ease, and I also can enjoy the occasional beverage with friends etc. what do you guys think?",8.349268292682929,7.13578404878049,8.090365853658536,73.57140243902441,62.17073170731707,11.248780487804881,37.26829268292683,10.270032843473604,3.6999475609756094,1360,55,251,25,16,436,185,328,0.076,0.8320000000000001,0.092,0.8019,1,0,9,0,0,0,47.0,5,1,2,5,11,19,3,2,25,0,20,10,0,1,3,48,36,18,0,6,7,3,4,3,2,1,1,1,3,2,18,20,10,2,8,9,2,2,3,12,0,3,7,6,27,7,42,28,8,64,0,0,1,0,26,29,0,4,34,168,45,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08086032452336887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060507365549302784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10290634500192744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06735576838851415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745396407294478,0.06317512275086104,0.04612322757741105,0.0,0.12876662439778605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772599890810725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848620559823469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04879612699686887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07742912422148422,0.0,0.5188439006612727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1340292373410337,0.0,0.16876763154745705,0.0,0.0,0.06374901609159696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15302916537011496,0.16216016093778682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06435858131568079,0.0,0.0,0.116913496681813,0.0,0.0,0.07258247436426936,0.0,0.0,0.12102860959367225,0.0,0.0,0.07491788410073275,0.13381640039982984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22768731475066856,0.0,0.0,0.08730449857663633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06167512944328327,0.0,0.0,0.08220765213490852,0.0,0.0,0.11089479486318483,0.07583381709852285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12078635420024413,0.08041738513807464,0.05562072757366943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08046804898722612,0.21301271479226866,0.0,0.07260031932850079,0.08614238819605786,0.0,0.08057821517485365,0.10254189161640276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222852702685899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14305125420661502,0.08529822943041965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2895956148029264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06016994799478983,0.07575147665170863,0.0,0.06029330775433299,0.0,0.07893260841762822,0.0,0.0,0.06258889666248807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866712693724459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06081474355635887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050266879099574495,0.09696309661011812,0.0,0.0,0.1764779161138998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0513699486803051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09101280925648787,0.0,0.08333168043422279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12138397104672795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652498536708039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14617272929384809
alcoholism,hope1075,2020/02/27,"How much did/do you drink in a day/evening? Hi I’m in the UK.

I am an alcoholic. Been drinking heavily since 2003. Female mid 40s. I am looking to reduce and then stop my drinking. I currently drink 75 units a week.... vodka - mixed with tonic water (I only have one night a week off (Wednesday or Thursday), and one night a week maybe 7 units, due to morning commitments on 2 days). 

I tried going cold turkey for a week, October of last year. This was the longest I had gone without a drink, in 12 years! As you’d expect, it was excruciating! I felt good physically after day 3. But the thought of no drink each evening after that, sent me in to a massive panic!! I got to end of day 6 and then drank my usual amount and the relief was out of this world!!!! (Obviously this is, I expect, completely normal alcoholic feelings!!!!)

I cannot sleep when I don’t drink - but this is not primarily because I drink on the other nights . 
I have had problems with insomnia all my life - even as a small child in the late 70s! 

I also have problems with feeing like I am so inadequate as I only work 2 days a week due to health issues and depression etc and also as mum to one teen I don’t have much to do during the day so just clean my house, visit friends, 
and also get involved with charity work 6 hours a week. 

Anyway . I would love to reduce gradually to 55 units a week and then maybe 45 units by Christmas.... and so on ....

To you who are managing this or have managed this ... How did you do it without completely losing your sanity? 

Thanks",1.9582600339174687,4.018586013114756,3.793691351045791,86.59606557377049,79.03278688524591,6.698699830412664,23.304126625211982,7.753152298057669,1.1635155455059354,1174,39,241,19,29,395,164,305,0.078,0.809,0.11199999999999999,0.9092,1,0,11,0,0,0,62.0,0,5,0,3,13,11,0,1,19,0,25,17,1,2,3,38,38,29,0,6,8,1,2,1,1,1,5,0,1,1,11,15,12,1,3,9,1,4,7,5,0,3,13,4,28,6,38,23,6,51,0,2,1,1,14,13,0,2,35,159,39,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15778734514719386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1771071899875211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04500143718169385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1548027201781011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28565596456675485,0.0,0.06358310705446868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57854261734644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06538471635132066,0.0,0.08233146690178404,0.14627695573024393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03732681305103941,0.0,0.07088106095207912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057034987065774014,0.0,0.03856914623931061,0.0,0.041954959351603135,0.06191870921581352,0.059042500469815434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07846973702728724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07270017315184828,0.0851811140445846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07705138425581931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06017509201099451,0.08327485924357565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05214292963453543,0.03606588557747645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06199220590863755,0.08258835932073783,0.0,0.0,0.06662757946969379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832900466962398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10853588568604196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20783190611580385,0.07233025766638157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15007186410543782,0.11229049193055768,0.0,0.08661465610168995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1412760939786276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061066634955267464,0.0,0.07387569286552816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06171881458036525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06796572844196885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058606723065763935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050120549666297816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08130492117039652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4145110180254803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14232427843247505,0.0,0.10748714259382282,0.0,0.0,0.05244130013470493,0.0,0.0,0.0950783837196948

Turns out, his wife has a heavy duty medical disease and needs to go to special treatment. they can't afford their place and he needs a place to stay.

alcoholism,Cynergtic_soul,2020/02/27,"Welp. Guess my wedding is cancelled. I cannot express how wonderful my fiancé is. He’s thoughtful, kind, intelligent. The problem? 

He’s an alcoholic and hid it from me until it was too late. He masked his history of unemployment with excuses—always playing the victim. He masked his history of failed relationships with incredible women with excuses—always playing the victim. 

I’m an idiot for believing him. 

I sit here with the ring he put on my finger... knowing our save the dates are out...so angry. Because, as a consultant I can’t babysit his sobriety because I travel for work. Because, my absence leads to his no-shows at work and ability to lie to me. Because, his no-shows at work lead to his lay-offs and his alcoholism leads him to believe its everyone’s fault but his. 

I’m mad because he IS a good guy...except for when he drinks and he doesn’t drink when I’m present. I’m mad because he told me that he had his shit together and wasn’t a ‘fixer upper’ because I’ve had my share of those and only wanted an equal.  I’m mad because he’s a fucking liar. 

I’m mad because I straight up told him the wedding was off if he drank again. My first fucking trip? He’s MIA—not answering texts or calls. His iPhone location is home. That means he went and bought booze while I was on my first flight. And now he’s fucking drunk. 

I’m so fucking mad.",2.128842076277021,4.421000278810414,3.692581577860391,86.33374500894949,79.66914498141264,6.810463995594107,27.063334710174857,7.921354282810032,1.822666143466888,1061,46,210,19,27,351,139,269,0.19699999999999998,0.73,0.073,-0.9889,2,0,4,0,0,0,40.0,1,0,0,9,8,23,14,0,13,0,14,13,2,4,0,28,36,18,0,3,3,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,6,12,7,0,5,6,1,7,4,17,0,2,12,2,30,6,24,24,1,27,0,1,0,4,39,8,5,4,11,110,36,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22685129168802426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17662503504740734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5822881884897254,0.0,0.0,0.2391547747004989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837532759207964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2079430703380846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10141619081975524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1805561304475292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39247903457564026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0890206952411752,0.0,0.0,0.11691926476755207,0.10508997384664992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10646169131075643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11052288858244363,0.05832881903233,0.0,0.11972448973598505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561173055568948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08072017155421321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10155651067515392,0.0,0.10669462147165028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139488768379732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894567631843624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08425904382045632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20283238163951048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06260095682189737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09838786877630856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11509848286953575,0.2318018322177582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Tarlung69,2020/02/28,Worried I’m gonna get WD at 20 if I stop drinking I’ve been drinking since 14 now 20. Typically once a week or less back then bjt in the last 2 years it’s progressed a lot. Probably 10-15 drinks a week. Last year even more and pretty much since the start of 2020 “it’s now February 28th” I’ve been drinking at least 5 to unlimited drinks a night. Sometimes getting drunk all day or multiple times in a day. I go to school and work and stay sober while working. I go to school drunk on occasion and have 9am classes. I enjoy morning drinking and find it very hard to not stay drunk when I start. But anyway once it hits 5 pm I can’t fight the feeling of craving a drink. I look forward to it all day. I wanna try and go a week or 2 without drinking to see how I feel. Would it be safe to stop drinking completely or should i taper. On average I’ll drink 5-7 crown and ginger ales with about 2 shots in them. If it’s beer I’ll have about 6-7 usually always start my drinking on an empty stomach to feel it sooner.

alcoholism,myrebelyell69,2020/02/28,Alcoholism rant I just turned 20 years old last week and alcohol is taking over my life. The fact that I am a university student where drinking is part of the culture doesn't help. My friends and I go to the campus bar almost every day. This is the only way we socialize. When I start drinking I can't stop. I feel so lost. My uncle died because of alcohol but I cannot tell my parents about my alcoholism because I come from a strict muslim family who would disown me. I am so lost.,1.7813265306122474,4.039506520408164,3.644244897959183,86.39004081632655,80.73469387755101,6.777142857142858,24.08571428571429,7.908726449838941,1.4626416326530616,381,14,76,7,10,128,70,98,0.138,0.846,0.016,-0.8461,1,0,6,0,0,0,8.0,1,0,0,2,6,3,0,0,6,0,9,8,0,0,1,11,17,6,1,1,2,1,1,0,1,1,5,0,0,0,3,4,7,1,1,3,0,2,3,2,0,0,2,1,16,1,6,14,1,13,0,2,0,0,8,2,0,1,8,49,19,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6234134857902798,0.1460327875944778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17779944768600475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12562402619962915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09405157536620967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15135381021655014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857257575232978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287236222344602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748035402376238,0.0,0.07373860880884599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11267183710299612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08288144854447335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775019398082366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11887507148729053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10300764453720553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3183924795656777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15302940616410454,0.0,0.0,0.11091416572449256,0.0,0.0,0.16193262099555356,0.15792520261788245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14866051979788114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10322283494120722,0.0,0.0,0.12192467431559965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10964984638431044,0.0,0.12746630602395698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15862671204521592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11575711493394772,0.1169801212080183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1035970713806388,0.0,0.0,0.09391302351070528
alcoholism,TwoBirdsStoned87,2020/02/28,"What do I do? I’m about to turn 33. M. 

I’ve been drinking almost every day for close to a year now. Started with a 750 of vodka every day. For awhile now I’ve been drinking a pint of 100 proof every day and then switching to regular at night. But I never get sloppy. I never fall or break things or act stupid etc. 

I go a Day here and there and get by with only weed but it’s usually because I’m too sick to drink. 

I drink due to personal problems/recent divorce etc. Problems which were NOT caused by drinking. I’m also an extreme introvert and have no friends or anyone to talk to. I can’t even entertain the idea of going to AA. I can’t do the god/higher power thing. I can’t imagine being part of a talkative group. 

Just looking for advice or something. Starting to have pains and I’m getting worried. I can barely remember what I do most days. But I don’t want to stop.",0.2607312252964391,2.519293413043481,2.5500790513834017,91.6763438735178,87.69565217391305,4.86719367588933,21.40711462450593,6.351523495107088,0.4099217391304349,684,24,143,7,22,232,109,184,0.121,0.83,0.049,-0.9109,1,0,7,0,1,0,21.0,0,0,0,1,9,5,1,0,8,0,15,7,0,1,3,29,29,14,0,2,9,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,6,8,5,1,3,7,0,4,8,3,1,0,3,1,11,2,23,25,4,24,0,0,1,0,5,2,0,6,17,92,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11125565901180684,0.0,0.0,0.11400715423955685,0.0,0.0,0.09104805983097064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07960853966290253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06940362294642963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11695820938426872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36712825372561214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5576621018601416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539519821292424,0.07519871450819074,0.0,0.2877777364084948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08796240709125003,0.0,0.17845019963369502,0.0,0.12941036384304402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12029175635487985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12852597671175456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09560769508602973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17562062873948428,0.0,0.0,0.10684315991998786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659020078571836,0.1211474287795837,0.0,0.0,0.12329151028170217,0.0,0.0,0.0994118918013624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894177355101932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12897305192778175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764946396211523,0.0,0.0,0.16117122542186604,0.0,0.0,0.09518605635952362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09151058486280936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15127751057166836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238391756026204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12539279734147787,0.0,0.0671533436589091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1156230662871219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07331748392162432
alcoholism,muffinbutter412,2020/02/28,Confused a little. A little advice would be nice. I don’t feel like I need alcohol all the time. I’ve been successful in my job and career. I don’t crave booze at work. But when I go home I just think it’s more fun to have a couple drinks and hang out with the wife watch tv or play video games and go to sleep. No issues no anger or arguments. But i always drink on evenings 7 days a week. I can’t name a night I have not gone to bed buzzed if not sighing drunk as I turn off the lap top for bed. I wake up the next morning because I always make sure I get at least 8 hours of sleep rested but throw up a lot after my shower and say hey let’s make tonight not the same. I go for runs and what not feel better every maybe 1 time a week. But I always feel the need to drink after work because I’m bored. I’m not interested in what people say or do around me unless I’m buzzed. Which has basically got me to my high paying job which is sad.  Maybe a functioning alcoholic at this point? If anybody has hit this point and just stopped how? I could probably run half marathons and be super fit beyond what I am if I just went for a run instead of drinking and watching tv after work. It just is easier and more satisfying after a long day.,1.2329545454545432,2.9352639621212155,2.9136363636363636,93.76545454545456,79.83333333333334,5.915151515151516,19.333333333333336,6.816661863887847,0.015828787878787942,962,22,223,10,24,318,149,264,0.09300000000000001,0.784,0.122,0.8185,3,0,6,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,7,10,14,1,1,16,0,17,11,3,3,2,50,37,23,0,7,20,1,3,1,0,1,2,2,4,0,9,12,8,1,4,11,1,10,10,4,1,1,4,7,22,9,29,27,7,46,0,1,2,0,6,19,0,8,18,135,31,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10219392967503066,0.0,0.22352747680908572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26105569951807023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09309797508956667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1275014507230968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924921168230561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08349826404253362,0.11571528721266887,0.0,0.1348903211798708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4097925957285618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0690738090121529,0.0,0.08811278460735265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15863569408889966,0.07471165417452492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05463850053064325,0.0,0.17830491148849376,0.0,0.0836418227469734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049404047044413,0.10490181941854657,0.0,0.1029897946065118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1091538836101452,0.2075581406349942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693967930477488,0.0,0.051092287499343095,0.20963237400730006,0.0,0.09254961424064734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890979689267542,0.0,0.0,0.13961532855197914,0.0,0.21012843660227967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15508882813093794,0.0,0.0,0.1112215419607073,0.09814082688560197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0725022948536057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19772296299613934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11275444706014645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16633171749295034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20931015992885746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08743318979051981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09856499186613163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06701035537704123,0.0,0.0,0.12196235772608427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11375252382627032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16777481993224502,0.0,0.0,0.0969462941671788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228405482242594,0.0,0.0,0.07429031452911185,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Arbsbuhpuh,2020/02/28,"TIL that humanity is really just an absolute fuck-ton of semi-hairless sentient apes, trying their best to stumble through an increasingly complex environment that they are increasingly less equipped to deal with. Long read, but I mostly just want to write it out.

I just convinced my little brother to voluntarily get locked up in an inpatient detox center. I went with him and helped fill out the paperwork.

He has been to one once before that traumatized him, but he trusts me enough to go even though he's scared shitless and essentially believes he's stepping into a hell that he can't leave.

Words can never express how much I hope I made the right call. 

He was trying to detox at my house, we went through 6 days of ever-increasingly worse symptoms, all while he was holding himself to 20 standard drinks per day so that he doesn't die.

He is a god-damned warrior. Eventually it got to the point where he couldn't keep any liquids down at all, even alcohol, so we supplemented with low doses of benzos to keep him from going into full blown withdrawals until he could keep something down. 

I was with him night and day caring for him, watching him suffer and wishing I could make it easier on him.

I told him on the night of the 6th day that he needed to go to the detox center.

Then, the morning of the 7th day, he was doing so much better I was reconsidering. Back and forth, back and forth I weighed the cost of potential trauma with the possibility that he could die in my care because I'm not a medical professional. Maybe this was finally the turning point? Would I be wasting thousands of dollars of his money and abandoning everything right when the whole goddamn thing was almost over?

I don't know.

I never will know.

I feel like I abandoned him when he needed me the most, *again*, just like everyone else. Seriously, he has had an absolute nightmare of a life, a lot of which I never realized until he started telling me about some of it. Some of it he says is too horrible to tell.

He has never hurt a person except in self defense, and the world and every medical professional or therapist he's ever told the truth to has let him down...even me. What a fucked up situation.

I still made the best call I could. I just hope it was the right one.",5.039447004608295,6.3910093963133665,5.693963133640555,79.17523041474655,69.09216589861751,8.64147465437788,29.43778801843318,9.023248300946321,2.4002470046082958,1794,67,337,33,31,582,228,434,0.11699999999999999,0.741,0.142,0.8402,0,0,3,0,0,0,49.0,2,0,2,3,22,23,3,1,28,0,32,12,0,4,8,75,62,24,2,12,10,1,1,2,0,2,9,1,0,3,17,20,3,7,5,2,3,9,9,11,0,3,17,3,42,12,56,36,17,63,1,5,1,1,51,28,2,9,28,233,59,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845039104069382,0.07917917645760109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0537716649642878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12160295958576367,0.0,0.048201551426546016,0.0,0.06728443990086667,0.08908705568437078,0.16596235113577826,0.06993274978931717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16148268594843793,0.0,0.1612383281640217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525302007434759,0.0,0.0,0.2549744617186945,0.0815197500602243,0.0,0.0,0.16412848435031405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746044756826394,0.0,0.0,0.06605450168079291,0.0,0.0,0.08170250335584661,0.0,0.15667891173524864,0.14305028454257954,0.06662156225675178,0.07555667538037622,0.07106480637776749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03998117419237993,0.056489045739199995,0.0,0.08661950047194455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620156194654976,0.041311851406567186,0.0,0.13481530307264916,0.0,0.06324109408455462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053000288397323264,0.0,0.0,0.1570726559662296,0.0,0.09123846050989567,0.08464820112617097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21084845461100088,0.0,0.0,0.08691179602237611,0.0,0.0,0.08372582073669232,0.0,0.08085646747254906,0.05585088525422127,0.07726116085527297,0.07925090733537324,0.0,0.06997622325122996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0672241785946946,0.0,0.14963965838943902,0.052781167594301466,0.0,0.07943844235201103,0.0,0.0,0.15931342306006746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11625402216375512,0.11726175792417047,0.2439407745120913,0.0,0.0,0.1484074130087732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08420908914258625,0.10716245418488522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0690426120661199,0.0,0.0,0.14949717850294256,0.08914178838814207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909338840092925,0.0,0.05065554180257597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20258114327197324,0.0,0.0628812204812805,0.07916485660800512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08248933094476403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888023019315179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608734813158112,0.0,0.0,0.05596756178454779,0.0,0.06314699367278037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08218607414723401,0.0,0.0,0.1382248096926847,0.0,0.0,0.09180867532445472,0.05253191689379415,0.0,0.07768782909497612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15111335076075247,0.0,0.10736938211607018,0.08600761945868778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04663870862098767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466010545734386,0.0,0.08828105345507344,0.09092888663523667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08058111352403151,0.05617047329204364,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,PatterPat1,2020/02/28,"How to write a letter to my parents? Basically I've been trying to write a letter to my parents and tell them that Im a recovering alcoholic. Im 35 years old, I've been sober for a year and 4 months. (Tomorrow's my anniversary!) I live on the other side of the country and I only do birthday/holiday texts. I dont make a lot of money so flying home isn't an option. OH in case you're wondering why I dont just call them, its because I'm deaf. We keep in touch by text. Obviously this isnt something to text about.    

I've written 4 completely different letters- one was waaaay too detailed, one kept getting off the point, another one was a joke, then by the fourth one I was getting really frustrated.  I over think and I keep wishing that I could do this-  

Dear M&amp;D, 

Im a recovering alcoholic, thats why I've been distant all those years. Im sorry and I wanted to be honest with you about this.  I'm doing okay, I've been sober for a year and a few months.  

Love, Me. 

But I know that's not the best way to do it.  So Im reaching out to my fellow reddit users for suggestions or ideas or inspiration on how to write an appropriate letter?

alcoholism,fuckin_shelby,2020/02/28,Is my drinking behaviour normal? Im 19 years old. I drink 70cl wine(or beer that includes same amount of alcohol) in every 2-3 weeks by myself. When i feel sad and depressed I like to enjoy it alone. It doesn’t effect my academic situation or my social life. Other than that i drink with my friends once in a month-2 months  (35 cl vodka at least). Im confused if im getting close to alcoholism or its normal?

alcoholism,CapriciousSon,2020/02/29,"My saddest addiction Somehow I’ve managed to live to be 32 years old. Between personal habits risk-taking and other factors I’m quite lucky that I’m still alive at this point. 

Point is, I’ve lived through addictions to heroin, ketamine, benzos, opiates, etc...

But even though I don’t enjoy alcohol on the same level as “drugs” it’s harder to avoid. It’s everywhere. So now, when I’m not trying to be rebellious, it’s there, encouraged.

I remember joking about retiring to a life of resigned alcoholism later in life, if I survived, with friends in our 20s taking extreme risks. But it’s not fun, it’s sad.

alcoholism,Nienna27,2020/02/29,"This is my first post here. I'm worried about my alcohol consumption. Hello everyone,

this is my first post in this community and it's not easy for me to write about this topic. I don't even know if I should be worried about it, but something doesn't feel right about my alcohol consumption. 

For context, I'm a 27 years old Italian woman, I've struggled with depression and suicidal ideation, even though I have a good job and a generally ""normal"" life. But I'm not so sure about what's healthy and not, anymore. 

In the last year I've started drinking alone, just one beer during happy hours, but in the last two months I started feeling like that one beer has become, like, necessary to get relaxed after a workday. I usually eat something while drinking, but as you can imagine bars don't have much healthy food during happy hours - so I usually end up binge eating french fries and junk food while drinking. And I've started feeling like also the food is a way to release some stress. Sometimes I find myself looking forward to that beer and the junk food (the food plays an important role I'm sure) like that is the most pleasurable moment of the day.  

In social settings I don't drink much and I feel ashamed of my ""lonely beers"". 

Also, I'm going off my antidepressants this month (this has been programmed with my psychiatrist) and I'm having some panic attacks due to the lower antidepressant dose, and yesterday when I had anxiety I felt the need to ""drink it away"". I didn't, but now I'm scared. 

I'm terrified, I haven't told anyone about this and I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm just dramatizing a normal drinking habit? 

Anyway thanks for reading.",4.690723615464993,6.2851795391849565,5.0928095611285285,82.22358215778478,70.22257053291537,7.949895506792058,29.90608672936259,8.472884824447931,2.2543886102403343,1319,53,246,21,24,419,162,319,0.163,0.682,0.154,-0.4894,2,3,14,0,0,0,42.0,0,1,0,2,19,21,1,5,16,0,22,22,0,0,2,44,47,26,1,5,11,0,5,4,0,1,4,0,0,1,15,13,20,0,9,14,0,2,10,8,0,5,5,6,24,13,29,40,5,40,0,2,1,0,7,9,0,4,31,151,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16123341341905864,0.0,0.07812755428520972,0.0,0.12065013518081275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057707305788127064,0.0,0.07481090940216041,0.05274566580390298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08581781192788193,0.0708733429871371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08331165156111021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04864911292225458,0.0,0.06497175915228161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44338347088043584,0.0,0.15437697186957994,0.0,0.0,0.06681271551229882,0.0,0.0,0.09964775842208998,0.0,0.0,0.07208104701610107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15256811564095654,0.10778106742583048,0.072429100023243,0.0,0.06894590947399849,0.1283293606537079,0.4560794306575176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03941149459750254,0.0,0.04287125371053327,0.06327101094232009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16060318920152164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14857588309752434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07485725686886309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08291382890795854,0.1229786264378518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0532817287901206,0.14741425135743572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06334611279949358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578425161290664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204224463415339,0.0,0.11090630437628927,0.05593384200384007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478198942526303,0.0,0.0,0.07915598257568146,0.0,0.10223295108704168,0.0,0.0,0.08850631615840789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14449109782251401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07545507024083323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06442078452698015,0.0,0.0,0.07552325089023924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768961326439039,0.0,0.1161465680343673,0.07460680418856075,0.0,0.16017911450149525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08641014421258937,0.07886068164747492,0.0,0.08251327072709698,0.0,0.14219254213450852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06945009678684186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411416705913185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07208104701610107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07368869836647128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16616123372684366,0.0,0.0,0.05987651917629942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1532151108267346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971548911935418
alcoholism,duchesstina88,2020/02/29,"Sober but no social life? Hey, I have posted here before and I was really thankful of the support this subreddit gave me. It was super tough but I exercised severe self control and have been completely sober for 2+months now. In the past 4 months, I only had in total 2 drinks for special occasions(1 drink each). The only way I could achieve this is by avoiding alcohol related scenarios altogether.  Stopped going to weekend parties, work events, birthdays etc. No matter what my friends plan, it somehow always ends up with liquor. Also the peer pressure is super painful ( this one time, I secretly told the bartender that I am a month pregnant so that he serves me water all night. Which he was very understanding about). Now, most of my friends don't call me as often and the remaining I avoid owing to their partying. Which is leading to a very non existent social life for me. I am alone most weekends now doing pretty much nothing. Not sure how to deal with this.  I really don't wish to come out as an alcoholic in front of family and friends. Any advice is highly appreciated.",4.425655555555559,6.878498610000005,5.145333333333333,77.96322222222223,72.9,8.044444444444443,29.61111111111111,8.841846274778883,2.7529777777777777,862,37,145,18,18,278,136,200,0.128,0.648,0.22399999999999998,0.9829,0,3,4,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,1,7,10,14,0,3,9,0,17,10,0,3,3,30,26,11,0,2,3,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,1,11,9,6,4,2,6,1,4,5,5,0,1,7,0,17,9,22,18,7,25,0,0,0,0,15,6,0,4,13,102,28,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12140015049171267,0.0,0.2655369982341144,0.0,0.12866908790392914,0.0,0.09934998600192814,0.10337274535774604,0.0,0.0,0.08448346612546317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10571409129531167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12685693326805433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701669945701188,0.13025711788300398,0.0,0.13933913660595912,0.09919084091192427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12807992922189038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24340429490300866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11003456135295443,0.0,0.13855389075034372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117116877821004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879489336544524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07060511701281456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13126017547426586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17550047503962865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2974874833025133,0.0,0.0913263774698383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11658531178104073,0.0,0.11920599489899918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841842592568322,0.18897130267105336,0.13219386965264135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11859553103846897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11898195161204367,0.1263907695290528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15917512514396412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12960328829714515,0.14034920100004591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25328209339592045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386529251094087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409794144039612,0.11708919388669377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11437809221290607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244191817142923,0.0,0.0,0.11871103171698452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12933210693991634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20501233026958968,0.0,0.0986112669180924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428631142252347,0.0,0.0,0.09044392364451137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,sukmibeatiful,2020/02/29,"Trying to quit  I turned 21 in August and haven't gone a night sober since. My body hurts, I feel stupid everyday, I eat terribly if I do eat, I'm so fucking broke, and I just can't take it anymore. This shit is the devil and I never ever thought I would be here. I've been steady drinking since I turned 19 because my girlfriend at the time was 21 and she was my supplier. I've been struggling with this for two years and I'm kind of scared to quit. The last time I quit drinking was when I got the flu a year ago and that coupled with withdrawal symptoms was a fucking nightmare. 

 If there's anyone that was or currently is in recovery, please tell me how you made or are making it through. I want to do this on my own and I don't know how to find the strength or willpower to do it.

alcoholism,laylarose2407,2020/02/29,"My parents alcohol addiction This is the first time I've ever posted on here but I hope someone sees this, since I was little I remember briefly of my mom and dad drinking but I thought it was normal. But I always used to hear them arguing as a kid every weekend to the point they screamed and threw stuff at each other and it scared me, as at that time I was an only child ( before my sister came along). Fast forward to age 12/13 I noticed my parents drinking excessively to the point they'd pass out, it was more my mom passing out than my dad, but I still thought it was normal. I was a very isolated child. I wasn't allowed to go out etc so therefore I thought my familys drinking was normal. My mom and dad haven't been there for me at all growing up, it was mainly my nan and grandad caring for me and being there for me. My family kept my parents drinking problem hidden. My mom gets very verbally abusive towards me when she's drinking and she's hit me a few times and chocked me. And my dad shouts in my face and has strangled me and slapped me. The verbal abuse started when I was 12 and 13 and physical abuse started when I was 14 and continues now (I'm 21 now) when I was 15 I was in a terrible relationship where I was sexually assaulted most days for a year and when my parents found out their drinking got worse and I found my mom passed out and she hit her head off the washing machine and it hit me that my parents addiction isn't normal. They said because I was r*ped it was my fault they drank so much and I always blame myself. My dad is so vile to me, making sexual comments to me and threatening me, and my mom being still verbally abusive. It hurts a lot knowing its took me so long to realise their drinking isn't normal, they spend £200 a week on alcohol and I don't know what to do. I have pictures of my mom passing out drunk on multiple occasions. I'm sorry if I jumbled to timeliness up I don't talk to anyone about it and it kind of just came out",2.4443349753694608,4.2121345665024625,3.901980295566503,87.74819211822658,76.48768472906404,6.8074876847290655,27.60985221674877,7.6583078777640585,1.5960717241379307,1558,65,322,22,35,515,186,406,0.19899999999999998,0.778,0.023,-0.9979,6,0,9,0,5,0,28.0,0,0,8,1,20,12,3,1,13,0,30,16,2,4,2,64,60,39,0,8,6,18,0,0,0,0,5,4,0,3,18,34,11,1,8,9,1,11,6,9,0,1,30,5,71,3,42,24,9,59,0,1,1,0,39,24,0,4,25,230,89,0,0.0,0.2872681899458783,0.0,0.1321552530768858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12955472620596298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10087052132881233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042382345860378125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036949407238650624,0.0,0.05157759651180971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13865131858306715,0.06179946986655047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039090672157540834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4156468570341853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06760003879047223,0.0,0.054828351606310256,0.051069460667694334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428196553476035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05155778455321148,0.0,0.13291907722383908,0.0,0.0,0.031668035078290295,0.0,0.034448030459658927,0.0,0.04847812716378932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06220690471574265,0.0,0.0683157832074405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06020284990408412,0.0,0.0,0.06488797067447873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06311959902561376,0.06662315319802614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06075061823745746,0.0,0.05364101140753892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051531402572474,0.0,0.0,0.04045996027628405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4969283245131556,0.0,0.0,0.044557872941139776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29694164381919297,0.0,0.06900883457524795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04609927343674247,0.0,0.0,0.3365204130978717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11459863772128158,0.0,0.05805094682496521,0.0,0.0,0.057998902439783215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0650761802164336,0.06866324287090253,0.0,0.0576572880063564,0.0,0.0606846551455111,0.0,0.0483010860035999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0501400867386979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05135759437648787,0.0,0.0,0.06785181445032125,0.08580504864798626,0.0,0.09681198700285278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06938791872605234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048718809237853836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443609679888598,0.1060326011472763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06734379273233858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052350574636442465,0.0,0.10002491740720017,0.0,0.0,0.048620467539078935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061770301810319374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03903308582643205

It’s inexplicable, I know alcohol makes it worse... but I hate my job..",1.9861000000000004,4.23068541,4.239999999999998,82.47500000000002,79.9,7.2,22.0,8.238735603445708,1.3507999999999996,391,12,78,8,10,135,73,100,0.19,0.759,0.051,-0.9069,6,0,2,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,7,5,1,0,6,0,11,7,2,4,0,16,19,6,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,1,3,0,2,0,3,1,0,1,2,4,0,0,3,0,15,1,5,12,1,11,0,2,0,0,1,5,0,3,5,50,18,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17739235098238446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17051699435011405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1429665583464242,0.0,0.17227094913046295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626065685731138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18671590498612134,0.14701747521079198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398533570568843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08672269021818167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16388031817633905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3507541513625335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4941570547618343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18244703411080124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697355635734996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18119720465677164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11079931522766116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16721701116304916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13249127717747392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12624253445641015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14493567473261168,0.0,0.1822066829243304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588295843693821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633715774066256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16610942817554172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1907805725558909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09790493870896796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538739781510981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16915753488767207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,PadrePiosStigmata,2020/02/29,"Audiobook/hypnotherapy? Hi everyone, I (36, F) have realised I'm a problem drinker. Alcohol is bringing me nothing but misery and I feel like I've been in an abusive relationship with booze since my teens. I really want to stop and I'm looking for things to help me.

Can anyone recommend a hypnotherapy - based audiobook that worked for them or really helped? I've tried Alan Carr's before and am giving it another go. Although I found it made a lot of sense, it just didn't ring that bell I need to really make me want to stop.

I know that I have problem but before I quit cigarettes (will be 5months now) I read and watched a lot of about benefits quitting. 
Now I am trying to do the same with alcohol. 
Probably I will not be able to quit completely (because there are quite a few oportunities to drink during whole year) but I would like to make something like 2 weeks  to about month to try and feel benefits and being affected enough to continue journey.

alcoholism,crowtow,2020/02/29,"Drinking and Hooking Up Rant and a bit of helplessness. 

I have two problems. I drink too much. I’m drunk almost every night. I’ve never told anyone but I have pissed my bed more times than I like to admit.  

And when I’m tipsy, buzzed or drunk I start to cruise Grindr. 

It’s just so easy and idk what it is but I just crave sex. 

I know if I stopped drinking I would stop seeking casual relationships. But it’s so hard. 

I haven’t been in for testing because I’m afraid that I’ve slept with someone who gave me a really bad STI. there’s no proof, just my anxiety.

alcoholism,Motor-Photo,2020/02/29,"Alcoholic sibling / Friendgroup Hello all, my brother has drifted into heavy drinking over the past couple of years. I used to drink heavily and decided to quit about 4 years ago, i saw that i was heading towards problem drinking and stopped. I did not find it particularly difficult once i made my mind up but im sure if i had kept at it that could have been different. Now the thought of alcohol sickens me. I attribute it to finally seeing that alcohol was stealing my weekends and that it is really just a nasty drug that is somehow socially acceptable. Anyways my brothers and i friend group from growing up are all extremely heavy drinkers,  to be honest i was no angel but iam shocked at the amount they drink every day they seem to universally start drinking around noon and take back at least 10 drinks before i head out, i am sure they stay up much later drinking heavily. I have more or less cut that group out of my life as it is depressing and obnoxious to spend time with them.

My brother is extremely sociable and is either using socializing to cover unhealthy drinking or just naturally is social and drinks heavily while doing it. He has expressed interest in reducing his drinking or quitting which makes me really excited. Anyways my question is has anyone had any luck either waking up a group of people to how unhealthy and abnormal their drinking is? They are in their early 30s so in my estimation its way past youthful antics and more problematic, i havent really called them out on it. Also is it possible for someone who is trying quit / cutback to hang out with active alcoholics or heavy drinkers with out relapsing into heavy drinking? Because they have a group or culture of heavy drinking is it making it worse? It is very weird to live in a world outside of their drinking only to sociallize with them and be shocked. Maybe because they only spend time with heavy drinkers they dont see what everyone else does? It is really starting to affect their cognition and health.",7.6246420609363375,8.284098871934606,7.506644785731982,70.9558155808769,63.00544959128065,10.705424820411196,38.48018330443399,10.537671172512404,4.357823978201636,1614,80,262,37,22,516,198,367,0.142,0.758,0.1,-0.9544,1,0,22,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,14,3,12,17,1,1,7,0,35,24,3,8,4,63,49,25,0,3,13,3,0,0,1,0,7,0,0,0,22,25,18,2,6,15,2,3,4,9,0,0,11,3,38,8,49,35,10,48,1,1,3,0,34,23,0,10,20,193,60,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050770748457647966,0.2448378246945101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04580272168832752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038948900165267634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0400479460294199,0.0,0.0,0.05098680938420249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04404086739598426,0.0,0.06982850226305691,0.0,0.0487367265662185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058484082812036466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0457293519923784,0.06337359417618299,0.0,0.036937576177973636,0.0,0.049330792669120216,0.0,0.0,0.059840086496882765,0.0,0.0,0.050121656267357394,0.0,0.0671257633484043,0.7855064442463849,0.06642070745763715,0.0,0.04784583466292862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04825657860725971,0.054728627208480304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274186002028709,0.05234822652214294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044250450350238286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175611548695479,0.06088054685307232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0618667269747778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04045495997479746,0.0,0.0,0.0505747913814224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05419490096918006,0.07646288909231418,0.0,0.057540341414158126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05783132788652685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04210364609385014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0609959057098383,0.0,0.08712029393899441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10935075726188792,0.03970720828311889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06456885087692661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05480434996038006,0.0,0.0,0.06416100277223187,0.1827567381269973,0.0,0.0,0.14676708573531552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091281369455432,0.05214092338768194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23353821574217784,0.04852884204583939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08107894661203267,0.06104742919788364,0.0,0.047884386071911735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079618422935414,0.0,0.043063601411813326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0454698777475134,0.06679491663964952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03888590159540988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989342588329612,0.0,0.047257795818065135,0.0,0.04546215450795441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058368022413627166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07376632335021575

alcoholism,hightaurus,2020/02/29,"I have a drinking problem The title itself I know is true but i don't believe it for some reason.  It's something I've never said out loud before and something I hide from everyone around me.  Something tells me I'm out of control but I've been rationalizing for so long that I don't even trust myself.  

I have been downing at least 1.75 liters of whiskey every four to five days for at least 2 years.   I've always told myself it's a normal amount.  But I know that it's not beneficia to my lifel.  

Usually I only drink at night but sometimes I'll day drink.  I've tried to stop because I have an extensive history of losing my mind and acting like a complete fool.  I've completely embarrassed myself on numerous occasions.  You'd think that would be enough to stop.  

I've got legal trouble due to my actions from drinking.  I've got people I love concerned about me anytime I order a beer with dinner.  I've got a baby due in a week and I refuse to allow myself to be drunk around him absolutely.  The problem is I keep telling myself I'm going to stop but I seem to never do.  Anxiety and life hit and I feel compelled to numb the enormous amount of pain.

I'm so embarrassed of myself for this.  I want to feel like a good person again.  I know alcohol only brings out the worst in me.

alcoholism,ThrowAway827465,2020/02/29,"What are alcoholics thinking ? First off I want to say I hope I don't offended anyone and I'm sorry if I do that is not my intention. 

I would just like to know what my mom is thinking and I've been trying to see things her way but I just can't figure it out. My mom's been an alcoholic for 20 years now and suffered a lot of abuse from my alcoholic father growing up. So I can understand in a way how and why she started drinking. But what really baffles me is these last few years even when her kids and other family are super supportive she still continues to drink. She's been to rehab a few times failed the first time and completed the last two. This last one she completed she started drinking the next day. She also has a lot of medical problems arising due to the drinking. I just can't understand when why when everything's going well she still continues to drink? Because when she starts drinking she gets super drunk everyday, she can't control her liquor and causes a lot of drama. This causes my family to stop talking to her and it makes her isolated and upset. 

TLDR; Why does my mom continue to drink when she knows it'll just make her life worse? Also why does she always drink till she's super drunk causing drama and not control it instead?",3.418900952380952,5.303826692000005,4.581657142857143,83.41806666666669,74.08,7.961904761904763,26.30476190476191,8.704169506293173,2.0328761904761903,1003,36,191,20,21,329,128,250,0.145,0.747,0.10800000000000001,-0.9176,0,0,11,0,1,0,16.0,0,0,0,8,19,12,1,1,10,0,17,17,0,9,0,44,35,23,0,5,9,4,0,1,0,2,6,1,0,1,13,11,14,3,7,13,0,2,6,5,1,4,3,2,34,7,20,30,5,37,0,2,1,0,26,4,0,5,30,136,47,1,0.0,0.08765866840912563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371984476414844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832958675980093,0.06156042256599222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05173117152826018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04509981892052637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280051317452535,0.0,0.0,0.15514114849819308,0.0,0.1659581759148975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047713410512918886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12948738972742369,0.0,0.0,0.5798074220337537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04886558170015865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06649184112141436,0.0,0.13949062614753202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258611123190655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03865346576130696,0.0,0.04204668090789462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07348257609755847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08131908925462902,0.1809199387742564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05225692404019308,0.03614473249343873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886950642857618,0.0,0.0,0.09876948066887252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07453086383088135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2599466884226569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07868257771252116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05013331662345465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0707924752548486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04739589691627971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0588348626398281,0.0,0.0,0.05895548522219484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08281877231139033,0.15709827757844946,0.0,0.1181670670645504,0.0618537436999083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08395590437091605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059465351107243276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049151528723481684,0.09481162374750043,0.0,0.0,0.0862810613898443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050230122762985885,0.0,0.0722713921000136,0.1540394255181644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04363754383920791,0.11744974442222715,0.0,0.0,0.06652029346966408,0.0,0.2670353765148959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07539578127244141,0.052555946835277166,0.0,0.0,0.09528624323044692

alcoholism,jessducks,2020/03/01,"Alcoholic boyfriend I am so tired of my boyfriends shit today. Last night he drank way too much. 6 beers. A pint of fire ball and then vodka on top of that. I've asked him plenty of times to at least cut back. And everytime he tells me he will and does for a few days and then goes back to his normal amount and sometimes even more like last night. His excuse is is that its winter and he's bored. And that hes not working and stressing out about stuff. Anyways, hes sitting here telling me I'm I'm ng a child about how I'm upset about him and his drinking and that I shouldn't of made him sleep on the couch last night or gave him the cold shoulder this morning. Says I was giving him attitude the whole morning and I asked how because I wasn't even talking to him and he says yeah that's attitude. Anyways the day goes on we go out shopping and he asks if I'm going to hate him all day (has been asking me all day about it) and then tells me that I can't treat him like shit just because I don't like his drinking. I said not talking to you isnt treating you like shit. And then I ask him why he has to keep bringing the whole fight up if he wants to get over it. And he says I am over it I just don't understand why you have to be a child about it. I said so what.. me not talking to you because I wasn't ready to talk is me being a child? Me being upset about your drinking after you told me so many times you would work on it is me being a child? And then he says that I'm treatjng him like shit because I haven't hugged or kissed him today. I said so, I'm just not ready yet.

alcoholism,cheesedingo,2020/03/01,"Brother is buying alcohol for Underage Cousin My (23M) little brother(22M) has been a drinker since high school. Recently, he was living in a trap house with a couple of his friends and they would drink themselves silly and trash the place. His lease just ended and I offered to move into a place with him. He’s a goodhearted kid and I feel like if he’s around people that don’t party as much he might mellow out. 

We just finished moving in last night and it’s a nice place. He had a shot or two while moving in but other than that he was civil. But then around 11pm, my underage cousin (16M) and a couple of his friends stopped by and my brother handed them a case of Coronas and sent them on their way. I tried confronting him about it but he wasn’t interested in talking about it. 

This worries me greatly. I’m already scared for my brothers well-being but the fact that he’s now getting our younger cousin into drinking too is too much for me. And now that we’ve just moved into a new place, I can’t deal with this if he’s going to keep doing this to our cousin and himself. I don’t know what to do or how to approach this without him blowing me off like he usually does.",2.9999086559373644,4.423755537190086,3.8591866028708175,90.0798325358852,74.20661157024793,6.2517616354936925,25.54675946063505,6.5966054737557815,0.8408396694214879,928,31,195,7,19,297,136,242,0.06,0.856,0.084,0.5725,0,0,4,0,0,0,22.0,3,0,4,0,12,10,1,1,12,0,15,4,1,1,1,40,22,22,0,3,12,7,2,2,2,2,1,0,0,1,13,20,3,2,2,2,1,7,5,2,0,1,6,2,26,8,32,14,2,38,0,0,0,0,38,18,0,5,14,129,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11840085184981275,0.0,0.0,0.12225955635667995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19725323639763465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2451741284536138,0.0,0.0,0.11421965922327187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695310445733897,0.0,0.0,0.2170641082190012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981270849919288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05601876954021839,0.07914842169428371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17119220929995585,0.0,0.057883219539492874,0.0,0.06296452889704282,0.0,0.0,0.1221464024781873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11705575263306064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12783682309866445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09847527180276444,0.0,0.0,0.06088730471342544,0.09030866382340323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10825282778178567,0.11104071862700857,0.09782962888448256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175307169828135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4710090868423746,0.16288684380250262,0.0,0.0,0.10700170422371336,0.0,0.1039689408244415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680785909881735,0.0,0.4630080160097919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109391791753712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109201504855626,0.11212542816833833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09164666014958686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262542841644167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08904883185349859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07521915994130722,0.0,0.10822576379522073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201956902407553,0.0,0.0,0.08793997132405178,0.0,0.0,0.09961354499265654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10679763823641893,0.0,0.0,0.11251265636235988,0.0,0.0787020607041526,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,panicqueen8,2020/03/01,"How to become sure if your spouse is an alcoholic or beginning to become one? Hi everyone! I recently got married to the love of my life and we have been in a relationship for more than 10 years. I always knew he likes to drink and he would drink 1 - 2 times in a week. Some months before our wedding, he reduced his drinking to drinking once in 2 weeks. I was extremely happy to see this change. But post our wedding, he's been drinking 3 - 4 times in a week!!! He has some reason or the other. Often the reason is that he is under a lot of work pressure (which is true) and due to that he often comes home late from work in a drunk state. When he brings home office work, he brings along an alcohol of his choice and drinks a few pegs while doing his office work. I have also noticed that whenever he meets his close friends, that meeting is never sober. He and his friends will definitely drink. He also drinks with me at home when he is cooking a non-vegetarian dish. I have seen that alcohol often does not have a good effect on him. After drinking, he becomes unexpectedly over-romantic, egoistic, hyper, does everything slow, gets easily ticked off and often repeats his talks. All this drives me nuts and these habits are beginning to hamper our relationship, his mood and behaviour. Everytime I have a conversation with him about this problem, he vows that he will soon quit it. Those vows don't seem to be getting fulfilled. I am confused about what I am dealing with and how to help him overcome this?",4.8124748723018635,6.219715404844294,5.374374691052894,81.0424452133795,69.69204152249135,8.411336299225573,28.294776734223102,8.841846274778883,2.1711115834569132,1188,42,225,21,21,382,166,289,0.059000000000000004,0.833,0.107,0.9441,0,0,12,0,0,0,38.0,4,1,0,6,13,12,0,2,14,0,24,17,0,5,4,42,37,20,0,3,5,1,0,1,2,3,4,0,3,0,16,16,15,0,5,11,0,4,3,3,0,1,6,2,26,8,32,27,6,36,0,0,2,1,46,10,0,12,21,146,42,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2487452512346796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408986264341265,0.06455717956651864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2570605838937705,0.06601937049117361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207495326613144,0.06683286063026847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07998703102088983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13579082666744094,0.0,0.0,0.6840364569520517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413607295190018,0.0697286592271524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988441087049133,0.0,0.08107022746135217,0.0,0.0,0.06507486332589675,0.06205204690396182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08259098781051437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05200378692305743,0.0,0.2334731264248827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875195906437756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054800787392910486,0.03790425550541533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06596024220676909,0.07002375667447418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06192784120510924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059838561464380075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833137108171059,0.0,0.0826258056546155,0.052573802917873634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430526478532734,0.0,0.0,0.07423864792491336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08252150998673301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15954120742218025,0.07660611754523701,0.16659513984430788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06182543405774173,0.07063073746256247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312322110516331,0.0,0.0,0.062360120177880514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09048121733347332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867027281417561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22593207132934884,0.0,0.0,0.05511436659643257,0.0,0.0,0.04996238539341308
alcoholism,Brst_Ltvsk,2020/03/01,"I was sober for 5 weeks And i ruined that.

For context, my big brother is a Big alcoholic, to thé point that i don't know if he can je cured, and my mom has a pretty bad form of Alzheimer. And when i'm drunk, i usually text girls i had a crush on...

So, for those reasons, i completly cut alcohol out of my life, it was great because i didn't feel the need to drink. But last night, i wanted to go to the bar, drink only soft(non alcoholic beverages, that's how we call them in France) and maybe meet a girl, i wasnt tempted by alcohol

But i met a pub friend, i'm a sailor in the navy, and he is an officer, he's one of the reason i joined the navy. And when i told him that it was five weeks since my last drink, he ordered me a beer and told me to drink it.

I'm pretty weak when it's social pressure, so i drank, and then i drank again.

So, i had a five weeks streaks, it was great, i drank, didn't do anything bad, but i feel like shit, and lent jjst started.


Thanks you if you read that, i hope for you that sobering is going well, and i apologize for my Bad writing, i'm on phone and english isn't m'y mother tongue",1.1784567901234553,2.403999716049384,2.8908868312757185,95.9768240740741,78.58847736625516,6.341481481481483,22.026543209876547,6.961326702584282,0.3012948148148147,853,24,212,9,20,283,125,243,0.113,0.778,0.109,-0.0,0,0,9,0,0,0,38.0,1,3,1,0,9,15,2,1,14,0,17,17,1,3,0,28,37,24,0,5,5,3,2,1,1,0,6,0,0,2,12,13,14,0,5,9,1,2,5,8,1,3,15,2,32,7,19,22,1,24,0,1,0,0,25,8,1,3,14,124,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4580124980646573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08816943799496996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26837941806337545,0.06531328808675982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10940483113335604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11233724179501656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4198368208181056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10834929046021187,0.07654287484362203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08277830163981673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12178350374615356,0.0,0.0,0.2362507450521104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10641702731610596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05888290940590912,0.1746714490158614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567816492521785,0.05234458546990724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076393957652359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12548441327496448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07944506712125594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10054630850237056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07260276936238799,0.08148696695233458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10128462672617458,0.0,0.0,0.21800559797425131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10717184633071568,0.0,0.0,0.2203213928496604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099805978459517,0.08862967431948704,0.0,0.0,0.10921864474892566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07583626207380842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09864274298249667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20475917309493635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180027143984988,0.0,0.06319563005765462,0.0,0.25783059923930624,0.0,0.09633429124529333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Onyx_Mirage,2020/03/01,"Fiance experiencing ""trips""...what is this? Hey, all. My fiance and I live apart.
She's almost 30, 90lbs soaking wet, is on trokendi for migraines, sometimes eats sometimes doesn't, and has a lot of depression and anxiety. She has been liquor-free for a year.

When she was 18, she could drink 1.5 Liters of vodka straight in one evening. Blackout drunkenness was the norm, from what she told me. She quit liquor a year ago after leaving a dude who was abusive when drunk. 

Last night she took a single shot of vodka, and experienced nothing short of euphoria. She was instantly drunk - I heard the change on the phone as we spoke. She described feeling like she's in the clouds, floating, and peaceful.

Tonight she took a shot while texting me about depression. The same euphoria came back. But she's also seeing rainbow everything when she closes her eyes, and has random childhood music in the background every time she closes her eyes.

alcoholism,fvntac,2020/03/01,"How to help out my alcoholic dad? Hi, I’m a 14F and I have a 56 year old dad whos an alcoholic. He’s so sweet and kind and genuinely such an amazing person, I love him a lot and he loves me a lot too. However, alcohol has completely ruined him. He drinks every night and can’t go at least 2 days without alcohol. He’s picked me up drunk before multiple times (my parents are separated due to his alcoholism). My mom kicked him out and left me and her living alone at the age of 5. I want him to get help so badly, theres so many opportunities he’s lost and he has such a good salary and if we lived together life would be so much easier but he ruined everything because of his alcoholism. When I was born he went sober for 4-5 years so it’s not impossible for him. I want him to get help really badly. Whenever I mention it he tells me that he likes it and that it’s his life and that me and my mom shouldn’t worry or care, but I do. My mom already lost hope a long time ago. I know one day he’s gonna hurt himself because of this stupid addiction and I’m tired of it holding us back. There’s a hard language barrier between us (he speaks only spanish and little english, vice versa for me)

tl;dr how do I help/convince my alcoholic dad to get help when whenever I bring it up he tells me not to worry about it and that it’s his life/problem???",1.78735431235431,3.26209504895105,4.03442307692308,87.36266025641028,77.53146853146853,7.843589743589742,24.15442890442891,8.59863814320734,1.5062778554778549,1048,35,235,22,24,363,151,286,0.155,0.705,0.14,-0.8669,3,1,8,0,0,0,30.0,3,0,0,3,16,18,1,0,10,0,11,15,0,3,0,38,30,28,0,6,7,7,1,1,0,3,11,1,0,1,13,18,9,2,1,2,0,3,5,8,0,1,4,3,38,10,22,22,4,27,0,5,0,2,48,8,0,5,17,135,51,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08781410570504755,0.0,0.0,0.07140492343579692,0.6026028106891892,0.0,0.08342808781058512,0.08889167741027675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06193989373782074,0.1345159314081909,0.09820810228727006,0.0,0.06854423727621801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08212863360368887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844577547391252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038993861235786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07891077499439418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678689482704649,0.0,0.07239538528555757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12625605634692047,0.0,0.04577983723969379,0.06756360806445537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07215921024227076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2699631853194126,0.0,0.0,0.08000679961085863,0.0,0.0,0.08623310815317572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388302412270751,0.04426954268651996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08752051768397281,0.0,0.17068982085274922,0.03935387847251488,0.08073475835950919,0.14225865152980124,0.07128642011871941,0.0,0.0,0.17586511998566176,0.13696569534003802,0.14540353707580436,0.0,0.0,0.08166758314495287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830263133742917,0.0,0.0,0.0592153497245988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07559305647643508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845262894183194,0.0,0.0545844529401812,0.061263799603105226,0.0,0.0,0.08944400904136694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0703353285039241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707785549259652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05160398870506795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408128560926524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394161113329323,0.09258323920346727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19378945816208368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09502389303331917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07467296662074263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07764972726217889,0.0,0.0,0.16360993041325986,0.0,0.057222178781898614,0.0,0.0,0.10374632698897994
alcoholism,daiwyawergy,2020/03/01,"Not sure if this is against the rules, but need advice on withdrawals.. hi all! sorry if this is not the right place to post this, i just need advice/experience/response from anyone as i don’t really have anyone to go to. 
i am f19 and have been drinking 3-6 whiteclaws (i sound so stupid, lol.) every night-ish/a couple of days of heavy liquor consumption for the past two months. 
haven’t had any alcoholic beverages for around three days and suddenly i started feeling sick.

alcoholism,TinaRex,2020/03/02,"Helping an alcohol dependent friend Please let me know if there is a better subreddit for this post.

One of my friends who had been living across the country for a few years just moved back home.  I knew that he drank, but now that he is back I realize how much worse it has become.  He is now fully dependent on alcohol and is experiencing withdrawal symptoms without any.  

I am extremely worried and don't know the best way to approach it.  I know if I talk to him directly he will brush it under the rug.  He is not the type to accept or ask for help.

I feel very lost with all of this, and want to help and support him anyway possible.

alcoholism,helpmypen15plz,2020/03/02,"Advice please :/ So my mom has been “trying” to recover for the past 2 years and always stops for a little and goes downhill again. She’s in a AA program but it doesn’t seem to really help her. This January she didn’t drink the whole month then she relapsed and ever since then she’s just been drinking very often. There would rarely be weeks where she would not drink. Now she’s at the point where she drinks and try’s to play it cool like she didn’t. And every time you call her out on it she does the same bs. She starts making up lies and talks bad on others (I guess to make her feel like she’s innocent) . And she never owns up to it anymore, shes been secretly drinking almost everyday now. What makes it even worse is that she takes anxiety medicine. So she gets really crazy. The stories and lies she says is ridicules.  

My biggest worries is that she will either lose everything in her life because of this, get her self killed, or someone else in my family injured/ killed. 
Every day she has to pick my sisters up from school and she drives drunk there often. No one can ever notice she drank so she gets away with it. But when your in the car with her you can definitely notice by the way she’s talking and beeping at cats that beep at her. If she keeps this up she will lose my sisters custody, her job, maybe even her husband (my step dad). everyone’s sick of it. Seems like she doesn’t want to quit no more.

Can anyone give me advice on what to do? I’m tired of dealing with all this, and the rehab place that I looked at in my area (Richmond, VA) is very expensive I could never afford it. Is there any free rehab centers in VA that you guys know of? Or if not what would you do in my situation. 


Btw I’m 18 and my sisters are 13

alcoholism,bumblebooze,2020/03/02,"DT symptoms most hangovers? Hey all, couldn't find this in the search or on google, let me know if there is a better place to post.

Around 5 years ago I started to notice that the day after socializing with a lot of drinking, my hangovers started to be different. No longer just body and head feeling shitty and nausea, now I started to get these intense, all night panic attacks. I'll just lie in bed trembling and sweating, and while I normally have an anxiety narration in the back of my head, now it starts getting too loud to ignore and often sounds like there is really someone in the room yelling or saying something into my ear. I also float in and out of short ""dreams"" but have trouble discerning them from reality. This usually lasts until 5 or sometimes 8am, at which point I can finally sleep for a couple hours. Some time ago a friend mentioned these symptoms sounded a lot like DT, and when I read about it I thought ""yes this is it"". However, all the literature I've read suggests you need to be drunk for several days on end, then quit for several days, then these symptoms occur. For me, it can be brought on by one heavy night of drinking followed by one day of not drinking (typically just focus on hydrating when I feel this shitty). Two days of binge drinking in a row guarantee I will get these symptoms, and I think severity scales with amount of drinks. Has anyone experienced this? Is there a way to combat it? Could I maybe have alcohol intolerance, or is this more related to my anxiety problems? I realize the smart thing would be quit or significantly reduce intake, and I may have to do that, but that would make my social life stressful and I may just become reclusive.

Background: I'm 30yo male, have been drinking since I was \~13.

alcoholism,prettynicky10,2020/03/02,"Day 3 questions Day 3 sober (750ml vodka for 5 years, daily drinking for 10.

Haven’t gotten barely any sleep.

I’m itching and scratching unbearably, really irritating my face to point of bleeding. Feels like little hairs landing all over me. Also random “needle pricks” which are very painful.

How do you cope with that?

alcoholism,Pug_ca,2020/03/02,I’m taking my dad to rehab today He’s 72 and he got his first DUI last week after struggling for as long as I can remember. Booked himself into a facility the next day. I’ve never been more proud of him but I’m so damn scared for him that I’m putting this out to a bunch of strangers right now. I’m worried being away from my mom he’ll be so lonely he’ll just die. Anyone else ever gone thru this?,0.2115025252525271,2.0867851250000022,2.436969696969701,95.00601010101013,84.11363636363636,4.8202020202020215,17.732323232323235,5.82211442006289,-0.4812919191919187,313,7,73,2,9,106,67,88,0.265,0.735,0.0,-0.9783,0,2,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,2,5,5,1,2,3,0,4,1,0,0,2,8,13,6,1,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,1,0,2,1,4,0,1,3,0,7,1,14,6,2,17,0,1,0,0,10,4,1,0,11,42,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1579549186162811,0.2314618115215843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2122410050755041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456871679458519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344491081877747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18871092451930185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20433998260431155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921508943834006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.180673308080964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18413910066801675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19991488010798894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2645719966084149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17422843225958726,0.0,0.24024780015490366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22709244921078825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25590128907287885,0.19291783736291704,0.0,0.0,0.22616586152036014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23616030553034795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16984910165754816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21412730972031066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812037969422637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2294129763324607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,dnunn12,2020/03/02,"I may be in denial but I don’t think so New to the group. I’ve had another bad episode. 

A little about myself: Been drinking since college, I’m now 30. My situation is a little different from most. I don’t have the urge, I don’t drink during the week or drink alone. But if I’m at a social outing and any kinda alcohol is involved, 8 times outta 10, I’m going to get blackout drunk. This doesn’t happen often, maybe 4 times/yr but every time, I do something crazy. I can be violent when drunk, very rude, and lose all self control. I’ve got into plenty of bar fights, heated arguments with loved ones, and totally embarrassed my wife time and time again. 

This sucks because these moments have started to define me. Even if I drink with friends and we have a chill night, I am still treated like the guy to watch out for. My wife starts to get pissed at me while I’m drinking even if I haven’t even got drunk fully. People start to say things like “maybe you ought to slow down”. These things really piss me off when I’m not even drunk yet. 

I enjoy drinking socially and it seems like every social event I attend, everyone there is drinking. They are also drunk/tipsy but I’m the one that over does it every single time. What is my issue? Every time I wake up after a bad episode, I ask myself how did I let this happen again. Why did I have to have so many drinks? I was enjoying myself when I was buzzed. Why do we overdo it? Can I beat this without going completely sober or is that just my alcoholism talking?",1.8635294117647088,4.010847901960787,3.2344052287581704,90.04082352941177,79.78431372549021,5.910065359477124,20.330718954248365,7.0316486544052195,0.44360993464052223,1182,31,242,14,30,385,171,306,0.196,0.72,0.084,-0.9905,1,1,11,0,1,0,38.0,2,1,1,3,20,18,6,1,10,0,32,19,3,2,2,35,54,23,0,4,12,2,0,3,1,2,2,1,0,2,14,12,15,1,2,13,0,3,7,10,0,2,8,2,33,8,25,41,4,39,0,1,1,1,19,11,3,10,28,156,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16562289959529936,0.0,0.08025453164211215,0.0,0.061967382571238835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05269471569164863,0.08125326124491446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244112028836397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12939902324115285,0.04723616146171278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.081245030636707,0.0,0.08690974133645077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809588032405801,0.0,0.0,0.06781055217980604,0.0,0.0,0.6072724383250402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204721221712814,0.0,0.2611490110551388,0.07404341171915295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059867284840883724,0.0,0.0809688993640231,0.0,0.0880767974609529,0.0,0.12394897851973352,0.0,0.0,0.07672562081247862,0.13704533328468274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08087767536981938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923705855354743,0.0,0.11357063914552153,0.15532730976867554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08668961082245784,0.0,0.0,0.06993623534569733,0.0,0.0,0.07856099555490313,0.15569486782701422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07483870360007895,0.0,0.07271754036465289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10501618389243124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05372064532014362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049641002845382455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061621823274499686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07054245748032803,0.08083721872133823,0.0,0.0,0.06409914014577063,0.08710011980746653,0.0,0.2369687557822803,0.0,0.059654295496111974,0.0,0.0,0.16453989800112484,0.0,0.0618822735092813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062282177479004414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10295959506904807,0.049651387466500066,0.0,0.0,0.27110437986994057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06393598033013452,0.0,0.0,0.062156457346831576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13984231492452814,0.0,0.0,0.0746959765841984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Someone nice and nonjudgmental. 24/female/ky if that matters.",2.326740412979348,4.836758362831858,3.641792035398233,85.72487094395281,80.4159292035398,6.244542772861358,26.23082595870207,7.492282038375204,1.6192011799410038,457,19,85,7,12,149,82,113,0.11800000000000001,0.784,0.09699999999999999,-0.6602,0,0,5,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,1,1,5,2,0,0,5,0,6,4,0,2,0,19,14,11,1,2,5,0,2,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,5,7,3,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,3,1,4,10,2,15,11,0,12,0,0,1,0,6,4,0,1,8,56,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3944685917825664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12904588491357982,0.0,0.0,0.16429401725299253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11250365824137894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473529925865845,0.0,0.0,0.2380467752801963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18079467283795436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189753384705307,0.0,0.15549643631413368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18663417356111714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10142718136102216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849736518909578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871108727193099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473108824654501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12505995932823924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12794793087712136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11823133476675443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14676638260507766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15266667598236602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3127474932690023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29667833256545684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12261084239145688,0.0,0.18132538715760885,0.0,0.10761611992735233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18028444885280984,0.0,0.0,0.3187943514004372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17790545128113774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,superfurrykylos,2020/03/02,"Bit of a random one this...paint Bit of background first. I'm a recovering alcoholic and depressive who has been going through a cycle of relapse/recovery for a couple of years now.

I currently live in a council flat, which kindly paints their properties white to make it easier to customise as the tenant pleases.

Prior to my birthday in November I was asked by my sister if there was anything I wanted and I suggested she could get me the paint, saying I was going to leave the bedroom (it's carpeted, I can't be done with the hassle) and bathroom (happy for it to be white) and wanted the living room grey and one wall of the kitchen orange.

This was during a period of sobriety and was told by my mum that we would go down and select exact colours at the weekend. This never happened and I was told later in the week: ""oh we'll have to drop off the paint.""  They'd chosen the colours.

Anyway, I've had some bad times over the last three months (not because of the paint 😅) and have only recently reconciled things with my family. Today the paint was brought up. 

Firstly, am I a dick for being kind of pissed off about this? I feel I'm right but also feel like I'm a dick for  being pissed off.

What if I fucking *hate* the colours?  Maybe they're fine but what if not? I'll feel obligated to use them anyway. I'm the one that lives here. This is my home.

I'm not going to complain about this.  I've put my family through way worse shit over the years.  Hell, chances are it will be fine, but if not? I don't want to go to all that effort and work painting, just for my reward to be a permanent, constant reminder of a time my family upset me...that definitely won't help my mental state.",3.415159972770592,4.807615436578175,4.601784660766962,85.29299693669165,73.10029498525073,7.57526662128432,25.132856818697533,8.139509932561175,1.439780031767642,1319,41,267,20,26,434,183,339,0.129,0.787,0.084,-0.9669,1,0,2,0,0,0,47.0,2,0,3,5,9,17,6,1,26,0,30,8,5,2,3,41,56,19,0,9,12,2,3,1,0,4,1,1,6,0,17,13,2,0,4,1,0,7,8,10,0,6,13,10,27,7,45,31,4,43,1,1,6,3,16,14,7,6,20,180,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166928656339348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08732067202955117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898555775175735,0.0,0.10207962711482058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091170622354391,0.06656232991915258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2384184095775781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11799758391676647,0.0,0.08718079625534553,0.12081868999069988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940467685944478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11174115911839608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3088090362831383,0.0,0.1656320198243253,0.07800666966167326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18575704033171275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094609315440244,0.057048227733610464,0.0,0.31028118444648856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09655798021785864,0.11623674014247012,0.0,0.10780433227866204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07318898619868881,0.0,0.10952831475495968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2274129892028524,0.0,0.08900592021493338,0.0,0.11561838857241293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05334561571760084,0.0,0.2892551757883155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07288639861071226,0.0,0.10969787593156388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11003968878427384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871558819741595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08421547560845254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22197364252695173,0.08304531186957516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11985984655113592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1097679544569426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10781376533306994,0.0,0.0,0.09324923157585348,0.0,0.08683373085557736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208385082073198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254220414251075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12734127567398326,0.0,0.10350109333467926,0.2086749577729638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09430668800453967,0.0,0.0,0.19321252231668207,0.08667139718375161,0.08758710472016246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07949295728612255,0.0,0.11127580969697468,0.07756674763212848,0.0,0.0,0.14063192514892706
alcoholism,curieuxetconfus,2020/03/02,"“ You’re not an alcoholic so I wouldn’t worry too much about it.” A little back story: 
I’m in my late 20’s and began drinking at 21. I never thought I had a problem until two years ago. I began drinking before work (like three shots) and drinking after work. I would drinking before I would go hang out with friends. I would start drinking at noon. For the most part, I thought I was just “functioning alcoholic” and that most people were that way. 
Then I dated someone that abstained from alcohol and I began to realize how much I truly drank. I made some attempts to cut back but it never stuck. Then I got sick to where I was suppose to refrain from drinking to get better and I didn’t. I got really sick after that and then decided to stop. As soon as I got healthy again, I went back to drinking and steadily got back to drinking before work, hanging out, multiple drinks a day.
I began my attempts to stop drinking last year. I tried to quit three times.

My second attempt, about 8 months ago, I was feeling really down about myself. I talked to my best friend and mentioned I was worried about how much I drank and that I wanted to stop.
She said, “ You’re not an alcoholic so I wouldn’t worry too much about it.”

I attempted to stop drinking for a third time last December and I ended up caving after three weeks. When I told my best friend, she didn’t really say anything about it. We spent New Years Eve together, she asked me if I was drinking and I said yes. 
Thing is, what she said has really stuck with me. I don’t know why but ever so often, I think about it and it sort of makes me upset. It makes me feel like, maybe I don’t need to stop drinking. But then I want to and it makes me not want to tell her, or even hang out with her.
I don’t know if this post is appropriate for this sub but I don’t have anyone else to talk to about it..",2.2152092352092327,3.9845015502645538,3.455579605579608,90.68958874458876,77.14814814814815,6.274939874939874,22.56565656565657,7.106945922332613,0.6532158730158737,1438,42,306,16,33,467,170,378,0.09699999999999999,0.774,0.128,0.8977,0,0,17,0,0,0,42.0,1,0,0,11,27,11,1,1,7,1,22,21,0,6,3,71,60,33,0,12,11,0,2,2,3,5,6,4,0,0,18,20,19,7,9,13,1,5,13,3,0,6,30,6,56,8,49,25,10,63,0,0,0,0,20,10,0,8,48,216,74,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724590134179467,0.23448024372580775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038353763996282285,0.05620231247636361,0.04513848726309106,0.0,0.0512791757132968,0.0,0.0,0.16871107777225608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14002492716846796,0.0,0.1151274904209352,0.048512098836755946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03537497474362284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.698542466812667,0.0,0.0,0.04582177197100282,0.0,0.04858255334639914,0.0,0.0,0.03622920055164595,0.049616735815926516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05546959557213285,0.03918624933739868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12713545869859155,0.0,0.028657883818418217,0.0,0.031173631462945037,0.0,0.17548048466660768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060290402585621676,0.08942333257333368,0.06187539714750444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05359579142741012,0.05497607145634524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05190224837116149,0.10984232252134073,0.0,0.05510616382780057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043782309090658916,0.0,0.1612900001892968,0.04067203139678408,0.08461042214911678,0.05297636227583607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05939932459649401,0.0,0.03802744076620567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05253301272233032,0.0,0.0,0.052485915327741134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058341808572021724,0.0,0.0,0.14055827393942275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565303174213024,0.043620478132974996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046475885516617216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0388244977799941,0.0,0.0,0.2292934625361075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08817585123032982,0.0479430284788232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036441203186111326,0.03514691948672985,0.0,0.08709265432922865,0.06396923495318581,0.0,0.0,0.05241339593927165,0.0,0.0372408785079111,0.0,0.05358239209356496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09705931694619156,0.04353893064777138,0.04399893161945189,0.0,0.0,0.0508483140621886,0.04949535989106542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11979863484590005,0.1671144759977032,0.0,0.11689577030476955,0.0,0.0,0.10596858655007796

alcoholism,dso122783,2020/03/03,"Any (former) craft beer fans? I haven’t seen this topic of craft beer on here. I do feel I have a problem with alcohol. The thing is, I’m really into craft beer. I love going to breweries. Can releases, beer festivals, new beers, I love it all. Anytime I travel I check for local breweries to hit up. I have over 40 growlers from various breweries I have visited. Here is the issue. When I drink, I can’t stop. If I go to a brewery on Saturday afternoon and have 3 pints, I have to keep going or I turn into a real dick. I get crowlers, 6 packs, growlers to go, whatever I need to get me through the evening so I can drink until I fall asleep. I probably do that 4 - times a week. On a light drinking night I’ll have a 6 pack of an IPA. On a heavy night, 12+. I unfollowed all the local breweries on Instagram, and deleted my Untappd app in an effort to stop the cravings but it doesn’t really help. I just love the whole environment at a brewery. I feel like not only do I have to stop drinking, but I also lose a hobby in craft beer. Would be interested to hear from anyone else who had to give up the craft beer hobby.",1.0932627436281876,3.0873178577586238,3.3990854572713656,88.65880809595205,81.6293103448276,6.7934032983508255,23.44902548725637,7.893859768569023,1.2574443028485756,861,31,186,16,23,296,127,232,0.064,0.826,0.11,0.9184,1,0,12,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,2,7,8,0,0,18,0,20,17,2,0,2,23,39,10,0,4,6,0,2,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,6,5,12,4,2,12,1,7,4,2,0,0,2,5,26,6,31,34,4,35,0,1,1,4,8,15,1,2,14,119,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350149037491217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10103095905076488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08591290195473908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833716089838123,0.12944629686324596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4950452504472201,0.0,0.0,0.10553762711904288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08344382362734178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12775868854745534,0.09025455788530724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13201082919111226,0.1211931296087338,0.28719894074500185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14239000250187567,0.0,0.08468044617320762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13186209856476627,0.0,0.11229335884326126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06172145257057605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14133781608512733,0.0,0.0,0.3420698746434665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09367664101781488,0.0,0.12201622345658394,0.0,0.2371158031213489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608432124770687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13621171799038814,0.12088661617813842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14379817662176614,0.1618683222563122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3168679897226637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08393211236044927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07366761448959322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13741743319315536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10133922454654372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14104977956297246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08974556335377835,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,throwawaythisdrunk,2020/03/03,"Dealing with the guilt My mom came to my room today to talk and say she is worried. I haven't told her I'm a alcoholic and that I'm taking medicine for my compulsion.

I just hate the fact that I constantly feel like a disappointment to my parents, because everytime there's alcohol in the house I drink everything until I sleep.

I'm trying to get better. But the guilt is still there everyday. How do you deal with it?",2.4917857142857147,4.690769130952383,3.957380952380952,85.39178571428572,77.92857142857143,8.009523809523811,25.97619047619048,8.841846274778883,2.122504761904762,333,13,67,8,8,110,59,84,0.16,0.7759999999999999,0.064,-0.7906,1,0,3,0,0,0,7.0,0,1,0,1,5,6,1,2,6,0,4,4,1,1,1,10,13,5,0,0,2,2,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,3,5,3,0,1,1,0,1,1,4,0,0,2,2,12,2,9,11,0,8,0,1,0,0,10,2,0,0,6,42,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4098843457052656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11690027877589418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16960362693707265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2193320408405798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20723358799949265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39540974204133855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18786009260790412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1723491346409398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09696389992756116,0.13699943257552344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10019111010431804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1893316611953292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2212750659062033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09368838735713916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2245969131792428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2129361905636726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525019835768572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1919069619015558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15314654706616393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14418602281258744,0.1541362313270688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18177408571980302,0.18324299019307813,0.0,0.13019820244262534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947501889392876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,herring-salad,2020/03/03,"8 days Hey, guys i am 8 days sober and new to this sub. The first few days were going really well, i went to an AA meeting which gave me strength to try, but the past couple of days it's been really hard, i noticed that i am getting depressed ( i am diagnosed with bipolar disorder so depression is nothing new) and easily irritable. I have random urges to cry and get sad for no reason. I don't have huge cravings to drink, i tell myself that i am in no position to, because i have a very demanding job, but i keep thinking that after i am sober for a long time enough and done with this crazy semester, i will maybe able to have a drink and that keeps me going although i know realistically it won't be possible because i am an alcoholic. I've recently considered smoking pot again, which is something i haven't done in a long time, but i feel like it would change one unhealthy habit into another. Guess what i am trying to know, has anyone else felt like this or had a similar experience?

alcoholism,alex_harold,2020/03/03,"Getting day drunk while working from home, looking for tips I live alone and have also been working from home for a few years. What used to be a drink at the end of the day has turned into a couple before lunch. Sometimes I also smoke pot earlier in the day although I've always tried to just use pot as a sleep aid in the evening. As far as I can tell my substance habits haven't seriously negatively affected my life. Work is going well, I exercise, eat well, walk my dog regularly and see friends who tell me I'm looking good. Every so often I also take a day or two to force myself to be sober but do really struggle with it and tend to have insomnia and panic attacks over those days.  


I'm concerned that the habit is unwittingly affecting my life and am curious if anyone has any tips for substituting the habit? I've seen psychotherapists who basically told me that using edibles/pot as escapism and a weaning substitute for alcohol might be my healthiest option. I feel like pot could be just as much of a burden tho. Any thoughts, similar experiences, or tips would be appreciated.",7.676220095693778,7.117905521531099,8.193205741626794,70.16244019138757,63.162679425837325,11.619138755980869,36.22488038277512,11.022393298168332,3.9924220095693776,870,36,159,21,11,290,133,209,0.08800000000000001,0.818,0.095,-0.3629,0,1,3,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,3,11,10,1,2,13,0,19,10,1,5,0,26,36,22,0,3,6,0,1,1,1,2,5,0,2,0,7,8,5,0,2,3,0,2,2,5,2,1,4,5,14,5,24,24,2,16,0,0,4,0,6,6,0,6,9,104,21,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12486346499034764,0.0,0.1210081326495026,0.0,0.28030406869341984,0.0972179338982584,0.0,0.0,0.15890664404542842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169530689498775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13291921479519692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09941987613945047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09328501997035847,0.12927817125648158,0.0,0.3767517339840283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11445600371036158,0.0,0.11955365338729873,0.0,0.0,0.1034831054850552,0.0,0.0,0.07716988762598817,0.0,0.09844040431252267,0.0,0.0,0.11428922895695952,0.0,0.0,0.059076413387294996,0.08346853951525092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09026815305205553,0.0,0.06104262970730904,0.0,0.06640128957469213,0.09799752411327957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343945333857774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16505117981020198,0.0570807682574055,0.0,0.10316941348302984,0.0,0.19622769176898716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12394583599693244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08588880654474014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13708331387051922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07484892048159841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310414429216983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11692160713075535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155550066862123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12214363949998082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08784705539597627,0.0,0.2042417753539004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927557087280286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116429789546173,0.0,0.07932480887762823,0.12708535415067915,0.1141329953085092,0.0,0.0,0.3027295569109614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21010140034350872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2551766820144445,0.0,0.0,0.0829978150314863,0.0,0.0,0.07523934461187734

alcoholism,_Nonyl_,2020/03/03,"Tips for sobriety? I'm 19 and I don't drink every day, but when I do I binge drink until I pass out. Every time. Uni culture doesn't help :/

Constant organ pain is pushing me to sobriety and I'm going to face it without professional help as a test of character. Was wondering if there are any tips you guys have to battle this. This is the first time I've tried getting completely sober.

Alcohol has been a problem for years and this is the first time I've had to throw away my favourite toy. It completes me.

Thank you all and I wish you the best

alcoholism,almundis,2020/03/03,"Week one of my lent promise &amp; days now without a drink. This is the longest I have gone without a single beverage in about 15 years. I have tried to do stints of no alcohol in the past but there were always cheats, I'd either be stoned out of my gourd half the time or convince myself that a pint or two with lunch didn't count. 33 more days to go, and I'm not certain I'll be a tee-totaler even if I make it all the way through, but if I can get myself back to a point of enjoying a drink or several for pleasure rather than to black out whole chunks of time I'll consider it a win. For anyone else out there trying something similar I wish you strength and fortitude.

alcoholism,4_set_leb,2020/03/03,"Maybe I'm not an alcoholic. Hey guys,

This isn't to disprove alcoholism or AA or anything of the sort. It's very real and if you think you are an alcoholic, you just might be and you should seek help and find support. Do not hesitate to act, it just might save your life, and others' too. 

Admins/Mods remove if inappropriate. 

So, I don't think I'm an alcoholic. Honestly I never did, I felt like I was told by many people that I was, or I simply felt like I needed to call myself an alcoholic so others wouldn't try to talk down to me for thinking I'm not. I had a DUI over a year ago, my second one actually. The first one was marijuana related. The second one was alcohol. I will admit, I was drinking way too much. I used alcohol and weed to tone the world out and numb myself. I dealt with many issues including physical and sexual abuse as a child from various family members, and those issues came to light in the last three years. Now, I've been in therapy for well over a year, I attended a year of AA, six months of which were court-ordered. I went over a year stone-cold sober and abstinent. I loved AA, and still love the idea behind it and the brotherhood you become part of. I still don't think I'm an alcoholic though. I've drank some beer here and there, weeks between each time. I've went several months since getting off probation without any alcohol, and it didn't make me feel bad or anything. When I have had a beer or two, it doesn't make me feel bad either and I have absolutely zero, nada, zip, NO desire to be drunk and belligerent. I don't feel like I'm doing anything bad, and I don't use any substance to numb myself nor do I feel like I need to. I don't feel like I'm some special exemption either, I just feel like a normal person, enjoying life and causing no harm. I don't feel like an alcoholic who thinks it's okay to have a drink or two and try to lie about it and hide it, I feel like I am in a good place for the first time in a long time, and it feels good. I do know that if my habits had continued though, heavy drinking and smoking, I don't think I would have made it or at least not be where I am now in life, I really have accomplished so much and I am so happy with where I am now. I wanted to share this with you all in case there is anyone else feeling the same way, or with the same experiences or any advice or wise words.",3.4371196754563904,4.151483472616636,4.856886409736308,86.06719574036512,72.28600405679514,8.63975659229209,24.64198782961461,8.925248442259385,1.5257083164300207,1844,50,409,35,34,618,223,493,0.1,0.784,0.11599999999999999,0.8598,1,0,15,0,1,0,57.0,0,7,0,3,24,28,0,0,27,1,45,24,0,6,2,100,88,44,0,11,23,0,12,8,0,6,15,0,0,3,19,29,17,0,22,6,0,6,20,6,4,12,20,13,50,22,44,59,13,49,0,0,0,2,20,17,0,18,32,276,69,1,0.0,0.06532635490784977,0.053804132545939264,0.0,0.0,0.05387761020181348,0.04887414685125428,0.5892290424299711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11248175322607716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03855190744264338,0.056492665201290676,0.13611504596286586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13810710247568092,0.0,0.06089264456000126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05629934044011145,0.06306013379278266,0.0,0.056639175670506664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16203491102500875,0.0,0.0,0.04605849668510356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05393293622243687,0.05197668590801472,0.0,0.2787808146528999,0.2363321614472325,0.10587713389119477,0.0,0.05039269634916199,0.09379617374607607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028805936350257026,0.0,0.0,0.09248980444077767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054592648953315316,0.0,0.058692588203448685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036956052128805386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062241080908508224,0.0,0.11509392802219308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030300937613136163,0.044942655966100815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1168311506961067,0.21549071331043476,0.0,0.0,0.04879303551827436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09952358299388668,0.05217038607903154,0.07360652705930301,0.11179714953975987,0.05539085362298308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11697975266552214,0.0,0.0,0.0880169950387085,0.0,0.08106162877943912,0.08176430298028085,0.04252376851059412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05402092090936362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208338754928407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05970619374467495,0.0,0.03822389835953182,0.04814204691673488,0.05760468899685577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06275608067051659,0.03532110673502342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062287233689489026,0.0,0.04560851797784718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806229779181637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062566923557933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04431569292178826,0.0,0.0,0.0630520594383698,0.0,0.0,0.2119709742821262,0.10834037129324986,0.0,0.0964495697996281,0.0,0.0,0.052684174340784026,0.0,0.07486654511713023,0.0,0.10771841954008876,0.0,0.0,0.09523845209521954,0.0,0.04549242472967289,0.032520248457826015,0.08752772346658093,0.04422623916475905,0.0,0.04957328668845271,0.10222201385657864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05314849439736282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039166559312256016,0.0,0.0,0.1775267368326764
alcoholism,christycann,2020/03/03,"Coming up on two years sober.. I’m only 22 I feel like I’m “missing out” on nights out dancing with friends or a drink with dinner. Realistically, I know that I cannot handle just one, or two. It always turned into more, which would turn into blacking out every time with a bad ending each time. Fights, assaults, being taken advantage of, drugs, extremely dangerous situations etc. I started drinking heavy at 14 and it got progressively worse as I went through high school. I didn’t drink everyday, I was more of an alcohol abuser. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. 

Most people my age drink. Nearly everyone. Sometimes I will tag along for a night out but it’s hard to enjoy it when everyone around is drunk and nearly 2am. 

My question is, what do you do for fun or to make you feel like you aren’t missing out on your youth?",2.2915674095725223,4.777081335403729,3.641417610522472,85.82359517720133,80.36645962732919,6.272707343807088,23.13518450858605,7.510576382923642,1.1438239678480089,649,22,125,10,17,212,111,161,0.14400000000000002,0.75,0.106,-0.3174,1,0,6,0,2,0,23.0,0,4,0,2,3,12,3,0,4,0,12,8,0,1,0,30,28,8,0,2,5,0,3,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,7,16,7,1,4,6,0,3,4,6,0,3,5,4,16,6,27,19,5,32,0,2,1,0,7,16,0,5,15,82,23,1,0.0,0.1497432090110527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350650097964846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10516079459573953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125076800132707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10552454029260262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10886777855193648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4952289691336532,0.1465641759339868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193784072218477,0.0,0.14095047195673244,0.0,0.0,0.10648314279816433,0.2415287778115043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278061017049781,0.18057610539955973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09764320553837696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10108004411792827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11321435920606827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13353059652116187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06945680102058617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12348871664699228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436164532344415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23720380033744706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13459378856227008,0.0856404032345731,0.09611997957443658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08761807098134639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415779033128795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279063606164046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14205980651004535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12499603556022262,0.0,0.17890910004786353,0.0,0.0,0.1056618613887959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473899072832585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2749368617101581,0.2469156871569692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11715832306921692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287950916723653,0.08977886927277799,0.0,0.0,0.0813865194103805
alcoholism,aynon22,2020/03/04,"Looking for advice about my brother. Hi reddit, longtime lurker here needing some help for my older brother.
I am the youngest of 3. I have two older brothers. My oldest brother is super successful and lives across the country, we (my other brother, mom, and dad) don’t see him much besides on holidays. My middle brother (we will call him Sam) is struggling with alcohol addiction and is stuck in a depressive cycle because of it. It has cost him several jobs, relationships, and he has two aggravated DUIs. My family is at our breaking point dealing with him and his reluctance to address his problem.

Sam and I moved in together in 2015 after his seven-year relationship ended because of his drinking. I agreed to move in with Sam because my lease was ending and i was trying to do what i could to help my brother and my family. While we lived together I did my best to try to keep him sober but quickly learned that I was not able to do that no matter how much love and support I offered him. Unfortunately I became the middle-person between my mom and Sam - my mom would frequently reach out to me asking about the status of my brother and if he is sober. My mom and i are extremely close and talk everyday, and soon nearly all of our conversations became about Sam. i would alert her when Sam was not doing well and my mom and/or my dad would come over to our place and try to convince him to go to their house so they could keep an eye on him and prevent him from drinking. Looking back i see how severely dysfunctional and enabling this is, but we were honestly doing it out of pure concern for him and the desire to “save” him. We had several huge family fights at me and Sam’s place, but Sam would eventually come around and thank me and my parents for trying to help him. 
Sam and I moved out in September 2019 - I moved in with my boyfriend and Sam moved in with a friend who has previously struggled with alcohol but is now sober. Ever since then Sam has been really out of control. He had the interlock taken off his car (he was mandated one after his DUIs but my family convinced him to put one back on after he was driving drunk). He lost his job due to drinking at work, got hired at a new job and lost it in the same week because he no-called-no-showed while he holed up in a motel and drank for two days straight. He went to inpatient rehab (for the second time) for 30 days and drank the day he got out. 

There are so many other things I could write about, but the reason for this post is to ask how to break the cycle of myself and my parents coming to Sam’s rescue. My mom always rescues Sam when he is spiraling out of control because she loves him and would do anything for him (and clearly has). It is so unfair to her. My mom has had multiple health problems over the years and is not in the greatest of health, and bringing on Sam’s problems certainly isn’t helping. She is exhausted and exasperated and at her wits end as she’s done everything in her power to help but nothing works. My Dad tries to be supportive but is clearly fed up and wants nothing to do with Sam anymore. My Dad and Sam are starting to physically fight when Sam is drunk.

The most infuriating part of all of this is that Sam refuses to seek help. He has agreed to inpatient rehab but admits that he just goes through the motions so he can get out and drink. He has tried therapy a couple times but again, it seems like he doesn’t truly open himself up and eventually stops going and claims it doesn’t work. He says there is nothing he can do to stop, he’s tried everything and nothing works. My heart breaks for my brother, but even more so for my parents. He is currently living at my parents house. 

Tl;dr: my brother is an alcoholic, my family and I are in a cycle of rescuing him and enabling him and we can’t stop",6.381834379557414,6.103065372836222,6.8288443979455975,77.95107967154907,65.71105193075897,9.86875911483102,33.06071270052628,9.424239791934726,2.850354359267009,3009,114,585,51,42,983,306,751,0.094,0.774,0.132,0.9840000000000001,10,0,7,0,2,0,70.0,9,0,2,14,29,27,2,2,23,0,69,22,2,6,7,128,104,70,0,15,16,25,0,1,1,6,9,1,1,0,19,69,12,9,4,8,1,16,9,11,1,6,23,6,94,16,108,71,11,104,0,3,5,2,114,46,0,4,39,416,113,10,0.04856116661944243,0.0,0.0,0.05293883951260033,0.0,0.04745340999469732,0.0,0.15569135616711804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04040678078132556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04815962851176178,0.0,0.0,0.039961702448249606,0.04322973385649876,0.09079627102709184,0.0,0.0,0.07468107925684955,0.0,0.1480121822137963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050961948381210175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049586380582369034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12549343542929686,0.0,0.0,0.1089309552070298,0.11631642026260068,0.05373200721626214,0.0,0.09395380531338136,0.0500644304709744,0.041825661651951264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04969493352862312,0.0,0.1902858234313501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12903233972081946,0.0,0.0,0.03207419256087166,0.0439263553865426,0.0,0.0,0.0872872906309107,0.0,0.22889573027829002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03751823686899906,0.0,0.025371205270420315,0.0,0.05519686016470607,0.0,0.07767760218512683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10323649858788217,0.0,0.05754521625694047,0.19529715815731347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11206613266360273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1445683942765919,0.08632679228437606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02372453309098713,0.0,0.12864119942034896,0.0,0.0815582990359871,0.0,0.10602049964565094,0.0,0.08765669765715084,0.0,0.0,0.0492334009756259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3981197600274344,0.0,0.2580641747639348,0.07139608996946945,0.036007489732008575,0.0,0.04690067732484005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18638299629304528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658126065484088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21568571481710488,0.05258701119771506,0.0,0.0,0.04240173760058272,0.10147216679973743,0.0,0.0459059988115647,0.0,0.046508174075129964,0.0,0.0,0.1393994343780042,0.0,0.04881738513675972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031109526816152564,0.04992896713566625,0.0,0.10427303888000747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038617788798289365,0.0,0.0,0.07739392512051738,0.04420826226047325,0.0,0.1645808876803165,0.0,0.04017029884485221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03437184367619425,0.0,0.0,0.1217979291568663,0.0,0.1015333502206304,0.0,0.0,0.1102132728077663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039031626264409584,0.0,0.044708597824685926,0.05553392617696836,0.0,0.03226188130966316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05663281354870828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307889114713437,0.0,0.14231161072112458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02864263424858993,0.0,0.03895283869770101,0.0,0.04366232075253844,0.045016687969732766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414124306386286,0.0,0.0,0.17248229739257778,0.0,0.0,0.06254359832506581
alcoholism,kalisunshine,2020/03/04,"I was sober, drank again, then it almost killed me. Posting from this account, because I don't really use it. 

About a year ago, I wrote about how I had stopped drinking after getting acute pancreatitis (i'm very young). I wrote about my detox experience in the hospital, and I received a lot of positive feedback about being sober, though it was only for two weeks post my hospital experience. I felt really good about myself for a long time....and then I didn't.

I don't know what happened, or why I fell into a downward spiral, but I picked up drinking again. I told myself it would just be one or two drinks, and then I would stop. But one or two so quickly became 5 or 6, and then 5 or 6 became every day again. I felt like I couldn't stop, and I was so ashamed to ask anyone for help because they knew how it difficult it had been the first time, and would never have thought I'd do it again. I never thought I'd end up in the same place again.

And then in two weeks after that, I was in the hospital. Diagnosis: severe acute pancreatitis.

And then kidney failure. And liver failure.

I was dying.

And I was detoxing yet again, while dying, and all I could think of was how stupid I had been. How I thought I could have control and limit myself, and now here I was, dying of pancreatitis and organ failure at 22, because I thought I was smarter than my addiction. I think a lot of people think that. That they're smarter. I know now that I can't be.

I don't remember a lot of it. I was in the hospital for 34 days, and all of it was on a double dose of dilaudid, which is 10x stronger than morphine. For 19 days I wasn't allowed to drink water or eat anything. I had shakes, I had nightmares when I could sleep, and hallucinations when I couldn't. My heart rate was so high from detoxing and organ failure that I was put in the cardiac ward, with someone checking in on me every so often to make sure I didn't croak. 

At first, all my family visited me. Then slowly, they all stopped visiting until it was only my mom who would come during the day. She would sit and cry, leave, and come back the next day to do the same thing. I hated them for it at the time, but I understood much later that it was easier for them to accept I was dying when they didn't have to look me in the eyes.

Most of my experience was so hazy because of the pain meds. I felt worthless and empty, and just wanted it to be over with. Physically my body had given up on me, and mentally I had given up about 17 days in. I was tired, but I couldn't sleep. It was like being stuck in a fog with no lighthouse in sight. I just wanted it all to end. To finally die and let the tiredness take over in a different way.

And then it happened. In some respect, I still have trouble understanding it. For a brief moment, the fog had lifted, and I heard a man's voice in my head telling me that I was going to be safe, and it was time for me to fall asleep. I knew what it meant, because the feeling I had, was like I was falling asleep, but I knew I wasn't going to sleep. It was borderline euphoric, and all I wanted to do was grab hold of that feeling and let it wash me away.

But then a nurse came in. 

It was the end of her shift, she had said. She wanted to know how I was feeling. I told her. The voice I'd heard in my head, said it's okay to fall asleep now, and I was ready. She asked me if I felt afraid or scared. I said no. I didn't have an ounce of fear in my body. Though if I were to think about dying now, I'm terrified in all capacities. I wasn't then. I would later find out that she wouldn't have believed me if I was afraid. Guess it wasn't the first time she's heard something like it.

She sat beside my bed, and started telling my stories from her shift. Trying to get me to laugh. Played rock paper scissors. Showed me pictures of her dog on her phone. It took me a while to realize what she was even doing. She wasn't making sure I wasn't alone in my last moments, she was making sure I didn't fall asleep. 

She stayed by my side for 8 hours past her shift, well into the morning. Did everything possible to keep me awake, rubbed my arms roughly or tickled my feet whenever my eyes got heavy. Specialists on-call finally started coming around in the morning, poking and prodding me, and the urge to fall asleep in that same way I had briefly felt had dissipated. Some level of fear had come back, and I didn't want to die anymore. I was terrified of it again.

For some reason, after that day, I began to improve. My pancreatic enzymes went down, my liver enzymes started cruising to a healthier level. My kidneys started functioning better. In the end, I left the hospital with half a pancreas. But I left with something else too. Some sort of new motivation to give back in life.

I finished college. I got a job. I started volunteering and giving back. I've never looked at things the same way since then. I feel calmer, and don't have mood swings like I used to. Occasionally, I feel the urge to drink, but it dissipates as time goes on, because I know that I can't fully control my addiction, but I can prevent it from controlling me.

I still don't know who that nurse was. Maybe she wasn't even real. Sometimes I think it was God giving me one last chance. But I think that without her, I would have died that night.

It took me a long time to even talk about this. 

To admit that I felt I had not only failed myself in sobriety, but my friends and family too. I struggled for so long to tell myself that I was an addict. That this wasn't taboo. ""Its just college"" a lot of people said to me, ""It's normal to drink a lot"". But it's not normal, and its not just college. Young people can get addicted too. And it's so far from okay. It's so far from okay to normalize the behavior in young adults just because they are young.

It's been a year now. I haven't had a single sip of alcohol. And even as I type this, I feel like I'm questioning myself. If it'll actually help someone. But maybe it will, young or old. To know that they aren't alone, and that there are consequences for our actions. Maybe that there really is something out there for us, beyond life, that watches over us and helps us cross bridges that we don't think we can overcome.

alcoholism,davidc5731,2020/03/04,"I think I’m getting a problem? (m 25) Hi there, unsure if I’m posting in the correct place - please divert me elsewhere if needed. So I’ve never had the most healthy relationship with alcohol - ever. I don’t drink too often, but when I do I drink to an extent I shouldn’t - leaving me with crippling anxiety for days. I previously went out on the Saturday of last weekend, ended up waking up somewhere I shouldn’t sorrounded by my ex’s friends and family. Because I was so anxious I then downed alcohol until I went downstairs so I could hide my anxiety. I’ve felt rotten since then - I went for a meal last night with my family but a lot of people I didn’t know, because my anxiety was so bad before I went about it I drank some wine to see if it would chill me. I then realised that it was stupid and I was acting dependant so I made myself sick about 15 minutes later, I made sure all the wine in my system was out and went to the meal sober.

My question is - where do I get help? Does anybody who has felt the way I do have a full recovery? In all honesty I do feel like cutting alcohol out of my life is the right thing for me to do - because all it does it cause me anxiety, and I tend to use it to hide my anxiety and fears - which is I know, really dangerous.

TDLR; getting more reliant on drink, possibly going down the route of alcoholic. Any help would be appreciated.",2.7324216923796163,4.3522169032258065,4.578145550880475,83.8451893408135,75.30824372759857,7.862926601215523,27.184198223468908,8.587818076936951,2.0070796633941104,1072,42,218,21,23,365,149,279,0.171,0.721,0.107,-0.9523,0,0,9,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,0,13,10,3,1,13,0,24,15,1,5,7,46,48,20,0,10,5,1,3,1,1,4,6,0,0,0,10,11,12,0,7,6,0,7,5,7,0,0,17,5,38,3,32,25,9,41,0,0,1,0,8,16,0,9,16,150,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3923826828883689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06242039587415772,0.0,0.35109576525172403,0.1036966531893292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766408751847788,0.16786312589307925,0.0,0.07810658973592187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09429368762326557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07328690264220583,0.0,0.0,0.05919700217150225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16065221933361926,0.0,0.0,0.2697579741121103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0812987581415127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08302937427164515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17306301960376275,0.10328934899819643,0.04641181786465942,0.06557484504034028,0.17626572546997088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07091678113506122,0.0,0.14386957075654638,0.0,0.05216641263435084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12304989943691112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10089084497297594,0.14964231779362314,0.0,0.0971924317155523,0.0,0.0,0.06483404167987017,0.04484399217958075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07803663589332366,0.0,0.17370796908271305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06806117455529412,0.07079416140920243,0.0,0.0,0.08613876357389766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06363567776170824,0.0,0.0959010876412406,0.10075793388230524,0.0,0.10347951330526413,0.08790951486855708,0.0,0.0,0.08783070139688749,0.0,0.0,0.10282588662919502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05880306988144636,0.0,0.0,0.09854818474494192,0.0,0.07838821907457691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314480246125536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07592969523747208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08651105559683693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060981244503341275,0.0588153711559225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07927715000508269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07285868585858538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42545157696532937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304100656602983,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,mx__robot,2020/03/04,"I can’t make it happen, I can’t stay sober I can’t make it more than a few days, and then having an emotional shut down that makes me crave, and next thing I know, I’m drunk. I don’t know how I got two years without booze and cigarettes on my own, without any help. Now, I can’t get my shit together to save my life. I hate AA, SMART is weird, I can’t really afford, nor do I have the time with school and work, to go to IOP. I just don’t know what to do. But alcohol is impacting my life. It maybe once a week or so that I drink (and get blasted every time), but any use is too much for me. I always binge, and then who knows what’s going to happen.

When I have family around, I have no problem staying sober. I don’t want them to see me like that. But they live no where near me, hours away. My partner is straight- edge and hates me drinking, and sort of understands alcoholism— but not as well as I’d like for him to. He calls the days that I drink, “black days”. Because I’m a different person, we don’t talk, I isolate and drink. And do other things that are self- harming, that is never do if I weren’t drinking.

I don’t know what to do. It’s impacting my life again. And I really need help.",0.8827654196157724,2.4145302054263595,2.6429221435793733,96.09353387259857,80.27906976744184,6.347421638018202,19.356926188068755,7.255503002510835,0.10450131445904988,915,21,225,12,23,303,137,258,0.139,0.7979999999999999,0.063,-0.9579,3,0,8,0,0,0,41.0,1,0,2,1,10,11,3,0,6,0,26,12,1,5,1,41,50,25,0,4,10,0,0,2,1,0,4,0,0,3,17,14,8,0,6,6,0,2,18,6,2,1,2,2,36,5,22,48,4,27,0,0,2,0,13,8,1,3,17,145,53,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10756667019238704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375075474020875,0.0,0.0,0.13689399515490774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896018630460507,0.0,0.0,0.09456612433943737,0.0,0.0,0.0613566917802061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10277722496833863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947371691967832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10516020319205904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4930045471508749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11322026040068453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848038816246924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09488600574920214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051733173976824,0.0,0.11440601326548548,0.0,0.08050081797682675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17801294631189546,0.0,0.0,0.19874656419710265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13493019470181067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912221466251564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27657928649534314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2132810325047541,0.09834723349935956,0.0,0.08887780164461206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20155852266402985,0.0,0.10111873743980182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07399100231224551,0.0746323855314342,0.07762923843422265,0.0,0.10704483487365032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071913864740889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08788568298878953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631063247113626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12896084766384933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10186547447532496,0.08020683058406583,0.0,0.10500227283443644,0.0,0.10331811246239812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2145638629428353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090048489813936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373779631917934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11738230034791305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09832264598270372,0.10478256653505562,0.0,0.08693124768521128,0.0,0.0,0.05936731879357759,0.0,0.08073718264915059,0.0,0.09049848183956744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19405039997642395,0.0,0.07327605396063945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06481676419906175
alcoholism,Drew10shelton,2020/03/04,Wack How am I supposed to stop drinking? Iv been binge drinking almost every night for a few months now. I’ll tell myself not to and do it anyway. I’m tired of waking up sick and in a pool of sweat. My sheets literally reek. I literally started drinking for the first time like 4 months ago and I’m already an alcoholic. My friends are concerned and so am I. I don’t understand it either. It’s like I’m only depressed when I’m drunk yet I enjoy it. What should I do to stop?

alcoholism,brumeloss,2020/03/04,"Hobbies For Staying Sober? Hi everyone.

I didn't know where to post this because I don't really consider myself an alcoholic per say but I am quite a heavy drinker and it's because I am bored.

I am in university and have 4 day weekends. When I was 19, I was pronounced legally blind and had to give up my license and job. As I was transitioning through life and getting rid of negativity and constructing a support system for my eye condition , I decided to leave my toxic ex and consequently, lost all of my friends (not so much friends after all!). Therefore, I am bored out of my mind, never go out and find myself drinking from Thursday night to Sunday night (I only drink in the evening)

However, I get wasted every night from Thursday to Sunday. I really need to find some solo hobbies that I can do in order to take my mind off the drinking. I've gained a substantial amount of weight after losing my job and it's mostly due to the drinking and the garbage I eat while I'm drunk (alcohol munchies)

I want to know what solo hobbies you all do to combat your alcohol cravings. Keep in mind that I am visually impaired and cannot drive (however I can see pretty good for someone who is legally blind)

Thanks!

alcoholism,hideovs,2020/03/04,"I think I’m turning into an alcoholic? My husband and I separated a month ago. I moved out this weekend. However, almost every single day since we split I’ve been drunk. At first I was telling myself that I was just having fun, and that I deserved it because I’m going through a hard time. Most nights drinking at home, a few times I went out. Tonight is my third night in this new apartment and every night and including right now I’ve had to drink to fall asleep. The roommates I have are two complete strangers who I’ve completely avoided.. partially because I’m embarrassed they’ll judge me for drinking.

But I know I’m going to get drunk tomorrow.. and the day after that.. and probably the day after that. 

Am I still just “going through a hard time” or am I developing an issue?",4.000490196078431,5.667041810457518,4.807336601307188,83.30551470588236,72.07189542483661,7.714379084967319,30.39705882352941,8.344100000000001,2.28836862745098,619,27,118,10,12,200,95,153,0.076,0.9,0.024,-0.6322,1,1,4,0,0,0,19.0,1,0,1,1,4,3,0,2,9,0,11,7,1,0,0,19,23,8,0,0,4,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,8,10,6,1,2,6,0,6,0,2,0,3,5,2,17,1,14,17,3,34,0,0,0,0,5,8,0,3,20,76,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1199476586097759,0.1446094685590231,0.13549738199493666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16497226464305573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2837482191688233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2617989242938232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3976684902479147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280156898332065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11509798280099115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07069595771750829,0.0,0.23070612042775646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2424294544191563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13573093181691584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14123261556339414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07436501206738302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10800630960262383,0.14381732198418778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13068706298100366,0.0,0.380948947014458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14589133201696405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11555738003746505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193310362540364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10806190094808922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11827036272684767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08670371998429252,0.0,0.0,0.23670796968783606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14718272896547932,0.13218207421913902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254373939026417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,anonliv,2020/03/04,"Young AA I don’t even know where to start ...
Since coming to university I’ve become an alcoholic not going out every day socialising but sitting in getting black out drunk on my own 
I hide it from my friends or have started to ,I miss deadlines and let work down 
I wake up hung over and hate myself for getting drunk the day before yet I find myself in the local shop buying booze I shouldn’t be 
I drink to get over the hang over then get carried away and drink again alone .
It’s beggining to ruin my relationship and turn me into Somone one I was never .
I took myself to an AA meeting earlier because I know I need help yet again came home and got drunk .
Alcohol has taken me to some very dark places in the last few months including cutting my own wrists up (drunken ) 
I don’t know how to get out of this hole it’s gotten me into debt ,I’ve dropped out of uni but not told my parents (they wouldn’t understand ) ans I’m really at the end of my patience even with myself

alcoholism,swampixie,2020/03/05,"I feel trapped in the cycle I’m a 22 year old girl and had a seizure two weeks ago that I believe was from alcohol withdrawal. I’ve been binge drinking for about two years because of anxiety, depression, etc. My tolerance got super high and I started drinking up to 7-13 drinks a night. Straight vodka and club soda. Mostly doubles. The night before I had the seizure I probably had about 10 double shot drinks and did some cocaine. I had the seizure at work at around 10pm and went to the ER. They gave me Valium and I still felt like I was losing my mind with anxiety and paranoia and shakiness. Ativan did the trick. They prescribed me 25 of 25mg Librium. I didn’t follow the exact schedule and still have some. If I go almost a day without one I feel extreme levels of anxiety. I usually drink 2 beers to ease the anxiety as well. Am I still withdrawing from alcohol or am withdrawing from Librium? I feel so anxious without the two but Librium makes me dissociate and have blurred vision.

alcoholism,Talkin_body,2020/03/05,"Effects of sister's alcoholism led to a bad semester My situation for context:


So last Spring, my younger sister's alcoholism(9 years) finally got to me deeply. I was taking online classes to be with my family and help with my sister's 2 older daughters and newborn. During that time my sister relapsed hard. She drove drunk with them in the car, didn't wreck but had pulled over crying, a random stranger stooped and checked on her, took her and my niece's to her house, woman called my parents from sister's phone to tell them she has them safe!! Thank God for that woman. Then my sister became violent and beat on her fiance in front of my nieces and was arrested (again). She had to go to court for probation violation and jail time(previous DUI) Resulted in my nieces not being able to be alone with either of them which caused us to be primary caregivers. Then later my sister made accusations of me abusing her. First it seemed like sexual abuses accusations but later she said it was physical abuse. I never did any of those but I think it was my turn to be blamed for her alcoholism. She blamed my mother before. She then sent threats to kill me to protect our family from me, which is untrue. I always stood in the way when she tried to attack my mom and I received bruises and cuts from it. I was devastated, even writing this I am in tears. She really hurt me and it caused me to neglect my school. I should have dropped but I wasn't in a good mind. I talked to my advisor recently to apply for graduation (spring 2020 Yay!) and she was concerned about my bad semester. She asked what happened and I told her. She asked if I have documentation of these issues but I don't really have any besides police reports that only mention my sister. She then suggested I write the Dean of students and plead my case to remove the bad grades of that semester. 


My question:

Should I provide the police reports and conversations (texts) from my sister as documentation? I don't care if they don't accept my request but I figured I should try. Anyone have any suggestions? 


Ps: My sister is doing better and I am praying she continues to recover for my niece's sake.",4.1073890429958375,6.2183927694174805,5.0110513176144265,80.10204854368935,72.76213592233009,8.009542302357838,26.57725381414702,8.759644201051973,2.1419692649098483,1719,61,311,34,35,559,208,412,0.228,0.715,0.057,-0.9981,1,1,3,0,2,1,46.0,2,0,5,4,5,19,6,0,8,1,32,3,0,6,1,50,50,30,1,5,10,14,1,1,0,3,2,1,0,3,15,19,3,3,6,1,1,10,7,11,0,1,19,2,76,8,51,23,1,40,1,2,0,0,63,9,0,5,20,217,91,8,0.10792489043770707,0.3836200414799953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2306777716457199,0.0,0.11177763804950784,0.0,0.0,0.08980215452688561,0.0,0.0,0.22017787919948809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075463592772737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20179040753991992,0.12278014341595064,0.0,0.0,0.2703383264694006,0.0,0.0,0.09183613271870512,0.0,0.0,0.09545079516895856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11020337986303652,0.0,0.1100366186181368,0.2217371835176599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11855042438338545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07128337227022202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20348396327079046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11822644214753993,0.0,0.0918008566728578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06133620236582505,0.09052227763740396,0.08631739400940554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09543762418664016,0.0,0.09667950322331988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07233977910134212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453083329195087,0.11553582736924214,0.0,0.0,0.11264554585014262,0.0,0.0,0.11940290086649415,0.0,0.0,0.08797319024997388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05272664997107808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10212114084683943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897337341419468,0.12640032729610384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08323832886400964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08208174245969753,0.0,0.0,0.11983781878139035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12090057706173678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13827889677831326,0.0,0.10656280915143952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10266128535748947,0.0,0.0,0.10922575095786956,0.0,0.09825076687907992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12131209872763182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811460861908182,0.08674593881163846,0.09433111122465954,0.09936273894871554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06915391197640602,0.0,0.0,0.1258637430464106,0.0,0.0,0.10312685783280147,0.119908524348007,0.1465478324626698,0.11739128938377615,0.0,0.0,0.12982035475529202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566575453930254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950009098535727

alcoholism,mizterfuz,2020/03/05,"I may be an alcoholic, but I'm not sure. There's too much history to get into, but my father's family is rife with alcoholics and bad decisions, which makes me worry that I could inherit that gene. Ironically, my dad has zero issues with alcohol. I first started drinking seriously in about 2014, mostly as an escape from my anxiety. I'm in therapy, and I've tried so hard to deal with my issues in other ways, but having a drink to soothe my panic was always a quick and easy solution. The problem is that I never seem to know when to stop. I don't drive drunk, I don't abuse people, but I still feel like I'm overdoing it. I just want to go out and have a beer or two with friends, but I don't know if that's a reality for me anymore. I feel like I might be dependent, but I'm also terrified to lose the one lifeline that levels me out the point where I feel like I can manage things. I know this isn't healthy. Any ideas?",4.9625200188412615,4.509000880829022,6.53770136599152,79.44087140838437,68.68911917098445,10.334243994347624,28.94441827602449,10.018931242160765,2.5150248704663216,722,22,155,16,11,250,119,193,0.187,0.652,0.161,-0.7666,0,0,6,0,1,0,22.0,0,0,0,2,10,10,0,1,9,0,16,7,0,2,2,41,32,16,0,4,10,2,4,3,1,2,3,0,0,0,10,11,7,1,9,4,1,2,6,5,0,4,1,4,22,5,21,26,2,19,0,1,0,0,4,9,0,7,10,107,32,1,0.0,0.15412984285373008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41706496486461264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10402919039970424,0.10824141443515052,0.0,0.0,0.08846248436333151,0.0,0.09951492043154764,0.0,0.1290096911455436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10861581583516386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386254986420516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341122619095899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25486819633854224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12263287064402476,0.0,0.1973251525224306,0.2787989545454287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11065051417729344,0.0,0.0,0.10050360229861023,0.0,0.06796421519588201,0.0,0.0739304901439738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11653090319394098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14685050211368714,0.0,0.2715505719629173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21447448396078328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19065936228471825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14553220832844085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08683296706713972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13799997658554955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09562768443813052,0.0,0.10032982503511303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08814918539311216,0.0,0.0,0.15262710483367414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901847876821252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12297268295915688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12447409120260472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184247976271652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09207506523198697,0.0,0.10388631157468782,0.10875715966715832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12260388284654973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14876391046995674,0.0,0.08642291213931068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08831939919334453,0.0,0.12707446404736591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07672769728908731,0.1032556789849895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13210796583376685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,kawhibot210,2020/03/05,"Lucid Dreams when not drunk I have a pretty serious addiction to alcohol. I actually drink myself to sleep 7 days a week. On my days off up to 2-3 times a day. While I’ve made attempts to stop, one thing I’ve noticed is that literally every single one of the handful of times I’ve gone to sleep sober over the past 5 years, I have extremely lucid dreams. I wake up every 1-2 hours, each time I go back to sleep I’ll have like really intense dreams. I’ve had intense dreams before, and night terrors even, but these are on another level. I almost like them in a way. They’re scary sometimes, but also exciting or something. Is this normal for people who have recently gone sober?",3.2454946524064137,4.893169191176471,4.762700534759361,82.93737967914439,74.0,7.886631016042781,24.863636363636363,8.575989854853784,1.7116117647058822,534,17,105,10,11,179,91,136,0.084,0.757,0.159,0.7943,0,0,3,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,1,4,5,0,1,6,0,8,9,5,1,0,10,12,7,0,1,4,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,5,2,3,1,0,6,0,3,1,2,0,2,4,1,9,3,16,8,2,28,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,2,18,58,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.14758649875329408,0.16487177383791154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16162745726221892,0.15144303852130214,0.0,0.0,0.12094499616487495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15858625880078542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11629270798688167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869242242305476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2926080489005058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14815569029364106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09989129098062294,0.0,0.2548491224735396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08595205646198761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489389927702354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14777452207868194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143105078656137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419266439148272,0.14818115633839574,0.0,0.17218549701219704,0.0,0.0,0.20496560337236105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443738104436227,0.10484940581038787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15386344529198234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09688695325888927,0.0,0.14932930692878793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4540417501873018,0.0,0.0,0.1164304225969398,0.14957827660841372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12644176320422998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1004758254590432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26456433064569296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12004570689109795,0.12131402333788245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09739233134875468

Do I just need to weather the storm and hopefully in a few days I’ll be able to sleep?   Any advice.  I’ve been running a mile on the treadmill.  Taking a bath with essential oils my wife recommended.  Then turning all electronics off.  No sleep at all since I stopped drinking so 3 days. I knew this was coming.

alcoholism,DudeFromSpaceAndTime,2020/03/06,"post about my feelings and alcohol im feeling like im becoming an alcoholic, in this year there are not weekend that i haven't been drunk, i know the reasons, but i cant find answers. My problems:  


1. I feel lonly - because I im, im introvert, but still i dont want to die alone
2. I have no hobbies - when i was 14 yeas old, i think i was a gamer, but now i can play new game 10 - 15 max and im bored 
3. my income - my job provide my optimal income, with that i can live,but i cant make any savings
4. my friends - i dont get positive answer, when i say that i feel depressed, they answer is drink a little bit more  
5. my family- im last one who still live with my parents, even that im the oldest,  my youngest brothers are left home, now i got this feeling that i need to take care of our parents, because they are old and nobody takes care of them.

alcoholism,TitchyTina,2020/03/06,"Just some advice from you champions Hey guys, I’ve been trying to quit drinking for a while now, it’s a process and I’ve failed more times than I can count but whatever I’m still trying.
I’d like to hear how people handle situations that are always the cause of why I drink. 
What do you do when your friends invite you out or come to yours and drink? 
What do you do on weekends instead of drinking?
These are the two situations that cause me to drink and if I can hear some ideas I reckon it might help.

alcoholism,2020Log,2020/03/06,"How to help brother alcoholic We’re a Muslim family and alcohol is foreign to my parents and me tbh. The thing is he’s not just an alcoholic he’s a violent one. Had to call the cops on him once. We want him to quit and parents will never throw him out (he’s in his late 20’s).

It was so foreign to us that we actually thought he had mental issues but he was actually just drunk the whole time, I do strongly suspect depression though. 

So how do we help him? We legitimately have no idea.

The plan I made with my doctor never included sobriety. And i’ve been having good and bad days, but again, that’s part of the recovery plan I made with my doctor. We made some drinking guidelines for me to follow, and if i can’t follow them perfectly every time that’s ok. As long as i’m honest with my doctor. 

My partner however has been extremely controlling of my drinking. Giving me strict limits and getting angry when I don’t respect them. He keeps saying things like “but think about how I feel” or “do it for me”. He also keeps suggesting I take my anti-anxiety medication every time i get the impulse to drink. And this really angers me. I feel like every time i mess up, it’s like I don’t care about his feelings or love him enough. But my alcoholism is not about him, yet he still makes me feel guilty for hurting HIM when i mess up. 

I’m really starting to feel like he is doing more harm than good. I feel enough guilt regarding my drinking, I really don’t need more. And when he tells me to take my medication, I feel like he is overstepping and not taking me seriously. Every time I tell him to stop, it goes back to me not caring about his feelings. I love him, but I am getting really tired of this. What can I do?",3.4971454545454566,4.583259105454545,5.091045454545455,83.05256818181819,72.49090909090908,8.554545454545455,25.022727272727273,8.982922981607832,1.7833818181818182,1054,31,217,21,20,357,128,275,0.136,0.665,0.19899999999999998,0.9644,1,0,5,0,0,0,28.0,1,0,2,6,16,24,1,1,5,1,19,13,0,7,2,47,51,24,0,2,10,0,8,5,2,0,7,1,0,2,9,13,5,5,9,4,0,2,8,8,0,1,6,9,49,16,28,44,6,23,0,1,0,2,26,3,0,4,23,148,58,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09236841824636888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06911881297766376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06611945308203405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06646007845627393,0.07216624711085327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644116645669392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17624426208774374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969396787167088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055740823374349865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2653972709490441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3386777716714457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17861258645679362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2912872692931805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3496167504673928,0.18523890000059492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1354698386457274,0.08291245909478892,0.0,0.14498838863880265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05793285520500808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925261376399328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15364762923058287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21112902307459053,0.0,0.0,0.07648868585423707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15601464417716787,0.2453492119914597,0.05769334153182385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1741402122411698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408746676979184,0.06666088994866792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09359631448177157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2214795622680482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06873337393839905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061176283206891065,0.0,0.06902388178818862,0.07226015842412636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19495599185449647,0.0,0.15108894928335004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057420893868256676,0.055381473639510674,0.0,0.0,0.20159436736053746,0.09933968190586852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08443049571932182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693297081859286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Schnabellex,2020/03/07,"Other (healthy) things that can relax me like alcohol? Since I've learned that I'm pregnant, I cut down every drop of alcohol to 0. Before that, I was kind of alcoholic. I needed the relief, the relaxation. I drank heavily about every weekend, and 1-2 beer every day. 

I have a very high level of anxiety. My body is always in tense, and so is my mind. Alcohol relieved that. 

I don't want to start drinking again when my baby is here. But I really miss the feeling of relief I had from time to time, the vacation from myself and tension. 

What didn't help: going to gym, swimming, yoga, pilates, dancing, sleeping, therapy,  medication. Do you have any more suggestions for an replacement, that is as relaxing as alcohol?",3.697888888888887,5.9161541407407405,5.492314814814815,75.72291666666669,74.25925925925927,8.944444444444445,30.50925925925927,9.516144504307137,3.3528148148148142,559,26,95,15,12,191,94,135,0.111,0.73,0.159,0.8735,0,0,7,0,0,0,30.0,0,1,0,0,5,11,1,1,6,0,12,11,2,0,0,9,20,8,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,6,0,0,0,8,3,8,0,2,10,0,3,2,3,0,0,4,1,14,8,16,16,1,15,0,1,0,0,3,4,0,0,8,65,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7353603966512399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11450942585737747,0.0,0.0,0.09358514342429693,0.0,0.10527760065151702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11710301257229253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15286287528332745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08875239993154256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348135137753443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3478479862817889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06958393279342699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821163483421524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09224262619516777,0.1454012590986152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14330825199584632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06723333585235362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13863592987490805,0.0,0.0,0.13895522316967507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10204220420556982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08816178833179132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11383925589462413,0.0,0.13771765728817345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09740692054437444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15737848646110378,0.0,0.09142746426252653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604926410556221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135494861416808,0.08117082181327122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,vagueblanche,2020/03/07,"Didn't know where else to ask: Did I experience symptoms of Alcohol deprivation? I've been drinking almost daily the past 3 weeks (Traveling, enjoying myself - usually don't drink more than 4-5 times a month, or sometimes go without for several months).

The drinks ranged from beer, to wine and also hard liquor. Went home to visit family and didn't drink for several days. 

I felt sick. Nausea, sometimes a feeling of weakness or almost pain in my joints, and fatigue as well as restlessness at the same time. 

I thought I'd caught a cold, so I drank a lot of tea, which usually helps. But it didn't help in this scenario. I continued to feel sick until last night when I had wine and some shots with friends. I was worried at first that it would make me more sick. But miraculously, I felt better. And even today, it's almost as if I never was ill.

I don't feel dependent on alcohol, I would know if I was addicted - I've been smoking for 7 years. I will also be volunteering on a sailboat in Norway for 2 months, cleaning up plastic trash and nets from the sea and coastline; so there will not be much drinking anyway, good for me.

Anyway, I'm not too concerned about alcoholism per se, I was just wondering if I was truly suffering from withrawal symptoms. That would be a first for me.

Thanks guys!",4.719991146525012,6.018465649402393,5.456301460823376,80.78019366976541,69.79681274900398,8.924391323594511,29.88069942452413,9.2995712137729,2.6019294378043387,1022,40,195,21,18,332,151,251,0.127,0.768,0.105,-0.6514,0,0,11,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,0,3,14,12,0,1,10,0,22,24,0,2,1,40,39,23,0,6,11,0,6,0,1,5,13,1,2,1,7,8,14,0,9,10,0,5,9,6,1,2,18,8,20,6,32,13,6,34,0,3,0,0,6,9,0,12,20,129,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284822234621202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3024731815786741,0.2834138361476757,0.0,0.0,0.15089275219972836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08819833563388384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08343906305028366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084368268558545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4621030338448725,0.0,0.0,0.0788117977214258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06231292031421627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922859399677277,0.08893855316249186,0.0,0.1431085603374328,0.0,0.181168901725269,0.0,0.0,0.16049688123473402,0.0,0.0,0.07288947024655185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05361752353563839,0.07913076070107965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934147902351542,0.0,0.0,0.0845131478563533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12647277330264556,0.0,0.09463411396777203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10369732135475407,0.0769024559199202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802073777045028,0.0,0.0,0.06297494641689692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2259119850284417,0.0,0.06935324804468375,0.0,0.07276343961294758,0.0,0.0,0.08853488192923968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10038802026319396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09006144236716647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2131623572399777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18661605310208515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19611781442273252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08685871946184655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07489811459453047,0.11002478055006797,0.0,0.08942650386191141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2078118340138677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567657795830103,0.0,0.08482603914730441,0.08745726910955676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09094366275740882,0.10231138366569234,0.0,0.0958102936088092,0.0,0.20105651543942524,0.0,0.0,0.06075405095853585
alcoholism,Marenigma,2020/03/07,"Looking for women who have or are struggling with alcoholism to share their experience- either here or through my inbox Hi there. I am currently working on a book that speaks to the alcoholic experience of women. While I appreciate the 12 step program, some severely egotistical men designed the process. I realized that women who struggle with alcoholism do not struggle with ego. We struggled with the opposite. Words like ""shame"" and ""guilt"" resonate.

alcoholism,Joshpills,2020/03/07,"how long does alcohol withdrawal symptoms last? my father is an alcoholic, 1+ litres of vodka a night.   


how long do withdrawal symptoms usually last? im not talking about what doctors tell you and how long ""detox"" they give you, to basically make sure you dont die.   


but for people who have been through it, how long until your symptoms of withdrawal were gone?   


im a former Benzo dependent.... and these things were HELL to get off and the symptoms destroyed me. they lasted YEARS. but ive heard alcohol withdrawal isnt anywhere as long as Benzo withdrawal. if they were, id honestly want my dad to keep drinking, i dont think itd be worth it for him to go through that absolute hell for such a long time. and he'd be unfunctional.   


so how long does it last?",2.8230115830115814,5.078718135135134,4.080154440154441,84.63878378378381,77.1081081081081,8.012355212355214,27.463320463320464,8.841846274778883,2.3287590733590733,596,25,117,14,14,195,89,148,0.122,0.77,0.109,-0.9199,0,0,5,0,0,0,23.0,0,4,3,0,8,5,3,0,5,0,15,10,0,7,1,19,24,16,1,2,4,2,0,0,0,0,9,1,0,0,9,4,4,1,1,2,1,2,4,3,0,0,6,1,14,2,16,14,0,20,2,0,0,0,16,1,2,2,17,71,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3167391291447512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10253157309648417,0.0,0.0,0.10111885771459844,0.17290890166145492,0.0,0.23156940289138775,0.09677956356411864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051615283343539035,0.09477128145281276,0.056146358572814636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21342686190449667,0.0,0.0,0.08781178892379625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3221180375732922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6120010910220723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06594511811566056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09271057108217322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06849065138284488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09311126647904208,0.4107351628717612,0.0,0.07940609945501596,0.08634946721681584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0656337027447141,0.0633025878482414,0.0,0.0,0.05760701327946744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10880657086354867,0.0,0.05827069178183481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06361947559181302

alcoholism,FinchGDx,2020/03/08,"Please be careful It was recommended that I share my story here.

I have a friend of 17 years, and he's been living with me as a roommate for the last eight years. I rely heavily on him for moral support because there are times in life when it gets hard and I get depressed. I had texted him a couple times and he didn't respond. Last Tuesday I went downstairs to check on him and he said that he was barely able to get to the bathroom and he was stuck in bed. I asked him what was going on and he told me that he just felt sick. About 2 hours later I went downstairs again to make sure that he was okay and he said he figured out what was wrong with him. He said that the symptoms he was having coincide with alcohol withdrawal. So I learned that he stopped drinking on Saturday prior to the Tuesday when I spoke with him. On Wednesday I went downstairs and checked on him, and he was sleeping so I figured I would let him do so. On Thursday he asked for some sugar, and some salt for gargling and something sweet to drink. That night I spoke with one of my other roommates and he told me that Amy Winehouse died from alcohol withdrawal and we should keep an eye on him. Yesterday while I was at work I asked my roommate to go check on him and he said that my friend was non-responsive but he thought my buddy was asleep. When I got home from work at 5:20 p.m. I went downstairs and looked in the room and he looked like he was dead. I looked at his chest to see if it was raising and lowering but it wasn't. I called 911 and after the first responders came I found out he was dead. I've never discovered a dead body before and right now I'm feeling angry and sad. The ultimate irony of all of this is that the thing that killed him is the thing that would have kept him alive. The coroner said that he had multiple organ failure and she had been dead for about 16 hours. I don't know where to put any of this. As an intj I pretty much have rationalized it to the point where I believe he's in a better place because his life was rather difficult and tragic but there is a part of me that feels callous and cold for not being emotional enough.",3.4060862630885502,4.70392815102975,3.8587559808612473,90.98341307814995,72.9816933638444,6.9445669509742745,25.599403647458573,7.348242739294969,1.0076230358504965,1690,54,365,18,33,529,203,437,0.147,0.7759999999999999,0.077,-0.9916,1,0,6,0,0,0,28.0,1,0,0,4,17,16,1,0,19,1,38,14,5,1,3,60,78,36,6,5,7,0,4,1,2,3,6,7,3,0,26,32,5,3,9,2,3,8,5,6,0,3,42,20,49,10,52,30,6,59,1,3,5,0,57,24,0,3,28,238,75,3,0.0874619515323077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18694045462018571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947712624008311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2452953545613447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10663198772322066,0.0,0.07442367887687626,0.09853966881657288,0.0,0.07735298861022452,0.0,0.09715051126681384,0.0,0.0,0.08930843134689748,0.10003317242321412,0.08917328862069471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09677498581759328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753308506955236,0.0,0.09077169722920472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1713588307779115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09838292341700536,0.0,0.09037157598623496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08844678126467719,0.0,0.08397718933658363,0.0,0.0,0.07439509129342227,0.0,0.09589751548089946,0.13514577359021904,0.0,0.13708577945011546,0.0,0.09941328523454894,0.0,0.06995131244171339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834872929489943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877314685985424,0.0,0.17226480878164946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774020115584268,0.0967636908043001,0.0,0.0480668012345197,0.14258632777999916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943577117029801,0.12355392584893572,0.04272949164486879,0.0,0.07723050558026093,0.0,0.2203380342952992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058381531800999385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06429459787736988,0.0,0.06745604887999711,0.0,0.0,0.08207711667798705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05926648189138847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09471277040453203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09137912402379984,0.09600695845136184,0.08267981439909951,0.0,0.0,0.08898024784751347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792341844307817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469202872460658,0.4159817224629799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969585163421124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08752511550770999,0.0,0.0,0.06733248329391389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312210776795378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925078612784508,0.08243185424952018,0.0909064562251948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621166853586685,0.0,0.0,0.06943501992186273,0.10199953457774268,0.0,0.0,0.16714728557742134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3243124212569828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12734668476467054,0.0,0.0,0.12426092192514075,0.095625913993407,0.0,0.11264525846817135

alcoholism,EmotionalRollerskate,2020/03/08,"Just told my mum I won't put up with her functional alcoholism So, long story short, my mum has been drinking since I remember. It's functional, she goes to work and does her chores. But her drinking problem has been an ongoing issue and the root of my trauma. It got to the point when I refrain from calling her in the afternoons/evenings because she's always tipsy/drunk or doesn't pick up because she knows I'll immediately know and point it out.

Today, I plucked up the courage and told her that I ask her not to be in touch with me in any form when she's drunk. I told her I love her, I'm incredibly sorry that she's unhappy to which she responded that I can't help her unless she helps herself which she can't do at the moment. 

Therapy is not really an option because of many factors that I don't want to get into. 

I'm heartbroken but I can't let myself participate in this normalization of her problem. It's been like that my whole life and now that I'm 22, I can't let it affect me anymore, I'm just incredibly sick of it. 

I know it may sound like I'm cold and selfish, but I'm just trying to stay afloat myself. As she said, there's nothing I can do. I struggle with my mental health as well and it only adds up to the pile of issues I deal with every day. Obviously, I do want to be around and check up on her but I don't feel strong enough to be around when alcohol is on the table.

I have mixed feelings about it all but I'm trying to stay on top of it. Any tips from you guys on how to deal with all those feelings?",3.757804232804233,4.095023228395064,5.177142857142859,85.42500000000003,71.34567901234567,8.393650793650794,26.848324514991184,8.418075326091056,1.5559843033509693,1202,37,268,18,21,405,152,324,0.10099999999999999,0.8390000000000001,0.059000000000000004,-0.9026,0,0,4,0,0,0,27.0,0,1,0,3,14,11,0,1,9,0,26,9,0,4,3,52,49,22,0,5,12,2,4,2,0,2,5,2,1,1,20,18,5,1,7,3,1,1,10,5,1,0,8,7,49,6,46,34,5,33,0,0,0,1,37,22,0,3,10,182,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2270628112102489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08839486143003135,0.0,0.0,0.14448497532777332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10535518065290712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18914084517558954,0.09931407106196176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19427704088901485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847637836125376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06851188043945627,0.2190443439681533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09296573508427472,0.0,0.0,0.20813695955317588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10976770190607736,0.0,0.07016628773873293,0.0,0.08950638580149448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16114469313711904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05550266887948089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08496471073172851,0.0,0.0,0.1051879613030723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129213440261858,0.0,0.0,0.14241227915367652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22176054613817792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17514961707516566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21726209734478305,0.07503593001397534,0.10380073712970528,0.0,0.0,0.09401338880523384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09587996733457928,0.0,0.0,0.10770419154452754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10705847758696267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408636780072182,0.10193399976231232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08079543624410758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20085017045608486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20330240695580265,0.0,0.10679410512541172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06805596137316032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12034195439765913,0.0,0.10105247631544666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08787752776471426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11891981239119792,0.0,0.2264617553782882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11105841952432123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12148737449897068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10069702671296968,0.30453225835854025,0.0,0.14425127561422665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253186537723542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551676025668293,0.0,0.0,0.11860601525764068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07733932256589572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,huntyhunterz,2020/03/08,When is it really a problem? Since the beginning of this year I have drank about 6 or 7 doubles of vodka daily . At first they used to get me very drunk and would make me sleep in early now they just get me tipsy . I guess people can develop a resistance to it after a while. I only ever drink when I get home from work. Can someone point me in the right direction as far as a self diagnosis or ways to at least cut back on how heavily I drink ?

alcoholism,PowPopBang,2020/03/08,"Going to talk to my husband tomorrow He's 32. Adding new drinking stories under his belt is no longer cute nor is it welcome. We were supposed to do a sober March, which was no big deal to me but I should have seen the writing on the wall when he made excuses for not making it through the week.

Our friends got married today and he got so drunk he was falling over in bushes, shoved me when I tried to offer him water, and had the groom worried enough that he left his own wedding to help my husband (one of his groomsman). I had to get several wedding guests to help me guide him to the Uber. My husband is currently staying at an Airbnb with some of his friends. I only left to take care of our dog.

My husband has recently (as in within the past two years) developed his social identity around collecting beer. We literally have multiple fridges dedicated to the rare beers he's ""aging"" but I hate them all. He's admitted to blowing thousands of dollars on beer every year but refuses to stop.",5.704076923076923,6.108915882051287,6.117756410256412,80.14432692307693,67.1025641025641,9.166666666666668,34.71153846153846,9.075114841892004,2.994307692307692,787,36,151,13,12,254,128,195,0.096,0.779,0.125,0.8495,1,0,4,0,0,0,19.0,4,0,1,0,4,6,1,0,9,0,13,6,0,2,1,19,24,10,0,1,4,4,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,4,6,6,2,1,5,1,2,4,1,0,3,9,1,24,5,30,14,4,30,0,0,1,0,39,13,0,1,14,99,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15074363511253913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17264784164701644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17457646776372926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16588337572029918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17496783825736245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14267164714186206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26165487982970737,0.0,0.08847030431288723,0.0,0.09623671725167768,0.0,0.27086458961512777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671827936088846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22700273570584106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36796493049870377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16022842918249916,0.1130321154843002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16354434687605165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11474546177256922,0.12878654262788544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1616489720679911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671974223752323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1912998227973884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1726152312914674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804880811862607,0.0,0.14157125163922665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273184946510014,0.13610468310960105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16050933723644542,0.0,0.0,0.11496703229554825,0.0,0.16541523318213333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.135829948033814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17196743765501496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2180917744216371
alcoholism,bixkler,2020/03/08,"How do I stop this from becoming an issue? So, full disclosure, I am very drunk right now. Thank god for autocorrect. 

Anyways, I’ve recently transferred from a local junior college to a university and I’ve run into an issue. Whenever I’m bored and alone with alcohol around the house (mine or something I can discreetly steal from my roomate), I cant stop myself from indulging. Whenever I have access to booze and I am bored or lonely I drink. I recognize that this is probably not the greatest sign, but having just transferred to my current university, I have no real close friends I have found myself drinking alone plenty of times (tonight includes) and on some level I recognize how dangerous that path can be, having had a couple of family members i grew up with end up in AA. How do I manage having fun and becoming a risk to myself and others?",6.528625000000003,7.265859612499997,7.317499999999999,71.09750000000003,65.375,10.4,34.125,10.355215969177356,3.7765749999999993,678,29,113,16,10,226,101,160,0.168,0.758,0.07400000000000001,-0.8458,1,4,4,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,0,8,9,1,1,8,0,16,5,0,3,0,25,19,13,0,0,5,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,5,11,5,2,1,3,0,2,3,6,1,0,2,0,19,3,19,16,3,21,0,1,0,0,1,11,0,3,8,88,24,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18129735661626145,0.0,0.3513990994903218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15101872066028652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3747159322145547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18770735473980546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33237217825332105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15025382709291749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599248353736177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18600538977053235,0.13106618125834388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1957458729723248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541275702730789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829044329632215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1930914927451784,0.0,0.0,0.16750253372856874,0.0,0.0,0.1448746596405767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305998881878941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2836591978012222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15618498296593905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892051473077416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13997369029097298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,throwaway131729,2020/03/08,"My body is saying it’s had enough. It’s time to stop. I started drinking around 22. Started out as a weekend thing and then slowly made it’s way into every day over the course of the past 5 years. My body is starting to reject. Bloating, muscle weakness, depression, nosebleeds, slow healing and I think it’s making my hair thin. I woke up last weekend after a particularly heavy binge, I puked my guts out and then laid there with my heart feeling like it was going to explode with every beat. I didn’t get up to go wash my mouth out and I still have red marks around my lips from the stomach acid.

I’m coming up on 28 now and I want to be healthy in my 30’s. It’s like I hardly remember what it’s like to be me anymore. I was a happy kid/teenager but now I just feel worthless and I drown that worthless feeling with more booze and I try and justify it in my own mind. It’s fucking cancer and I know it deep down. Probably the worst part of all, I’ve never told anyone about this until now.

I’m tired of waking up feeling like shit. I’m tired of passing out until 1am in my living room instead of going to bed like a normal person. I’m tired of feeling so drained. I’m tired of checking my eyes in the morning for jaundice. I’m tired of not giving my dog a proper long walk. I’m tired of not hanging out with my friends. I’m tired of disappointing myself every time I tell myself I’m going to stop at one and end up having 5.

I want to turn it all around and I’m hoping this sub will be helpful. Maybe finally admitting it in this post will make me want to turn it around for good. I see a lot of inspiring stories and support on here.

alcoholism,kinda-guy-kinda-sly,2020/03/08,"Not a true alcoholic, but I’ve been craving the “looseness” that I feel when I drink I’ve been craving beer like crazy recently. I used to never drink on weeknights, besides the occasional glass of wine before an exam in college. Fast forward a year and I wan to drink every night when I leave work. I work second shift so it’s easy to feel down when I have no one to talk to when I get off. For the first time since my last vacation two years ago, I’ve had beer four days in a row, and I’m currently more drunk than I’ve been since New Year’s Eve, and alone watching fuller house. I’m afraid I’m on a slippery slope to the alcoholism my grandfather suffers from, along with my step-grandfather. But beer just tastes so damn good, and it feels so good to drink it",5.322222222222223,5.01132931847134,5.418428874734608,87.28557678697805,67.9171974522293,9.015994338287332,28.90941259731068,8.515128840125781,1.7237493276716207,601,18,134,8,9,189,96,157,0.146,0.755,0.099,-0.6946,1,1,10,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,3,8,7,1,1,9,0,5,12,0,1,2,16,13,13,0,0,4,0,3,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,6,12,0,3,9,0,1,3,3,0,5,4,5,11,4,19,9,1,26,0,1,1,0,1,7,1,0,21,71,15,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12765915535241573,0.30781297152726633,0.0,0.1491544099496534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12254476321685732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09287670398594074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643130697029063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12133746797802512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21845244747919867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12249769138839928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07524103724615476,0.0,0.0,0.2415831492579144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661720831135541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11739011050950747,0.0,0.1524893555245727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07035765384105544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107198222785516,0.13908900156124568,0.0,0.13514678366633925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975871805812188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14219582019187665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23825868100152905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11575248452868557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08397534898629405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14068012784178127,0.0,0.0,0.12438130519750665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20968688415357375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27821964866828297
alcoholism,Momocito-22,2020/03/08,"I used to drink socially, now I drink emotionally I feel like I am starting to show alcoholic tendencies.... it runs in my family. I have always been aware of this and never really saw my personal drinking as an issue before... I drank socially and had fun and knew when the fun was over. 
Now... I feel like I drink to numb my pain... or to help my lack of satisfaction in life. I recently started depression meds and was informed to be careful when mixing because of the side effects.. but that one or two drinks would be okay. 

My main reason I tend to over do it is because my marriage isn’t going so great at the moment. Nothing truly significant has happened it’s just... flat. 
Husband isn’t very attentive to me. So when we actually hangout I mostly drink too much because I am happy we are hanging and don’t want the attention to stop... and I end up doing stupid stuff like spending WAY too much money going out.. trying to figure out what we can do next cause I would rather stay out and be in debt than go home and have him ignore me because of his video games... it’s not a healthy habit (for me or my wallet) 
Does anyone else relate? 
I have OCD and can struggle with the all or nothing. I wake up and say no more!! But then become depressed or stressed and want a glass of wine. 
I struggle with hangxiety as I write this...
I want to re find my healthy balance of social drinking rather than emotional... or should I take a break...?  I wake up and say I will do better and then end up doing it all over again.... 

any thoughts or tips are welcome. Don’t be too mean, I am hangxious at the moment :)",3.5166037735849045,4.838444323899374,4.642908805031451,85.37492924528306,72.74213836477988,7.438364779874215,27.08647798742139,7.937092434478242,1.5883874213836482,1237,44,251,17,24,406,173,318,0.126,0.736,0.138,0.4469,1,0,9,0,0,0,59.0,3,0,0,2,14,20,1,3,10,1,33,15,2,4,3,62,53,31,0,9,13,1,2,3,0,4,4,2,1,1,10,21,10,2,12,12,3,5,7,9,0,2,8,5,39,11,38,37,8,42,0,2,1,0,18,16,0,8,21,181,49,0,0.0,0.0,0.08290702684162356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09079456488754913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07069209562814252,0.0,0.0,0.05777454439919893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0594048054285423,0.08704979875289795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2071591180859124,0.09382974649174017,0.07229323962740608,0.0,0.0,0.07513869545130028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866206296155392,0.08727555738572224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14634888580762986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07434756419546076,0.0,0.0,0.5825873997263592,0.0,0.0,0.07097174213702491,0.19113326202529796,0.15049563996088455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800911061996044,0.0,0.08591491913236708,0.12138842579248063,0.0,0.0,0.07765032965217977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14485124680880135,0.0,0.0,0.09366680469203063,0.0,0.0,0.07512832727754683,0.0904396698791296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0569457448865524,0.0,0.08522008288183784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08867437247219423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060008546359827414,0.12451897401162446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925444743434497,0.09436949767769358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1249082238674602,0.0,0.06552506379142234,0.0,0.09035409563603357,0.0,0.0,0.16303952384517892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057569929918886376,0.0,0.09040160095001752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07418229394421626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05442645026673605,0.08735126261283702,0.08388605300869187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13512446999676705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598128051829697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12026781708856438,0.09055422344878546,0.0,0.07102892706600868,0.09731942380034034,0.1776336833683049,0.09725690561329092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387805409650184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06744738515344441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057681095966614485,0.0,0.08299189558090388,0.0,0.0,0.07337667694457582,0.0,0.07009947934637198,0.15033178591740354,0.06743592894685288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12070385044950692,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,queenblattaria,2020/03/08,"Best Friend Cant/Wont Quit My best friend has had a drinking problem for 7 years. Every day from when he wakes up until he passes back out again, he's drinking. He's even broken into my apartment once to sleep.    

Recently, he's gotten a new girlfriend and new apartment. We thought he was drinking less, but she approached us saying it's out of control. He's spiraling and needs help. Ok, nbd. We're here to help. We all meet with him and basically have a baby intervention. ""Dude you have a problem, we know, we wanna help.""    

And we thought it was getting under control. He's seeing a doctor, he's picking up new hobbies, we're hanging out sober having fun.    

Again, not what's happening. He leaves early ""for work"" and goes to a bar for pre work shots. I have coworkers telling me he has a stash of booze in the basement, and he's getting fucked up at work. We work in a restaurant. Whenever our boss, or his wife, comes back they keep feeding him shots. He never turns them down. In all the years of being over 21, I've never seen him turn down free booze.    

So at this point, I'm personally at a loss. I've had mutual friends tell me this is why they no longer talk/hang out. People dont wanna be around him when he's drinking. I don't wanna be around him anymore, and we've been inseparable for 13 years.",2.092709923664124,4.199678698473285,3.2697190839694663,90.2863496183206,78.80916030534351,5.7187175572519084,23.45709923664122,6.742157984588678,0.6654621068702284,1017,34,211,10,25,328,148,262,0.07200000000000001,0.7959999999999999,0.132,0.9432,0,0,4,0,0,0,44.0,8,1,3,10,11,12,1,0,11,1,17,12,2,4,4,43,33,13,0,6,3,1,0,0,4,0,1,1,0,1,5,22,8,3,3,5,1,4,6,4,0,0,9,3,25,9,36,21,5,45,0,1,2,1,46,23,1,1,18,121,30,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09994876005885606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.179434868172879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1549904245992326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21152918775697796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08681485339683798,0.0,0.0,0.2260713847140747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0649961155852785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10315474760017836,0.0,0.0,0.1181158680342594,0.3949123507897696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06656562509748548,0.0,0.08491326409169912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335919962755793,0.09317142543387402,0.10530897294433712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08912127624546258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20265634727720733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08957975918122556,0.0,0.0,0.05538720527064782,0.0,0.0,0.10671368978274756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07472864851246322,0.15545873368332475,0.2920079342011592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10732964498383844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06986961696412816,0.08799904045115696,0.0,0.0,0.09527165807266652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19286971334762484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10719416652261808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951016313341324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801459692667925,0.0,0.0,0.0803102836434305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10085488142450412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08100483265263675,0.1761759912537969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16001945636531434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21924396419430325,0.0,0.0,0.12122845467951122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09094016761084996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934822700259832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19470110013461128
alcoholism,violetine1,2020/03/08,"In a relationship with somebody in recovery, looking for advice. I hope this is okay to post here, feel free to remove if not. My boyfriend has been sober for 2 years and we have been together about 6 months. We were friendly for a year before that. We have discussed the challenge of him being sober and me not. He has said multiple times that he can’t deal with seeing me drunk but one beer or whatever is fine. I’m not a big drinker so it hasn’t come up often however recently I did accept a beer from somebody in front of him and long story short he had a strong reaction and we ended up having a horrible fight. I never want him to feel like that again and I’ve concluded that despite what he says, I need to never drink around him or anytime when he’ll smell it on me, which I am 100% okay with. It’s an adjustment I’m happy to make because I love him. He is so worried that if I make this promise, I’ll end up resenting him for it. I think he doesn’t fully believe that for me, being with him is beyond worth it. I know that addiction affects psychology beyond consuming the actual substance so I’m looking for some insight from people who have been through it.

alcoholism,halfarab,2020/03/09,"My boyfriend went to his first AA meeting while we’ve been together and seems to be in a really good place. What are the best ways to be supportive? What do I say to my boyfriend about him going back to AA? I’m not sure what is supportive or is nice to hear.

My boyfriend was out this morning and when I looked at his calendar (I help with his real estate business), I saw that he had an AA meeting for noon that he put in the night before. I was surprised because I knew he used to go but then decided that he didn’t really feel like an alcoholic and honestly I haven’t noticed any problems, especially since we spend most of the week sober. Nonetheless, I’m very proud that he reflected on things and decided to take action on something he saw as an issue.

He got home while I was cooking lunch and showed me his 24 hour chip after a few minutes of talking about my morning. I hugged him and kissed his cheek and said I was proud of him. I also asked later what made him want to go. He said he just hates how he spends at least half of his nights a week getting drunk and not remembering what he did, then struggling to get up in the morning and losing half of the next day. He told me he wants to be able to take care of me and his family.

I’m a bit confused because I genuinely didn’t see an issue. He did see one and that’s what’s important. I have no problem with his newfound (refound?) sobriety and honestly am just really proud that he has the personal insight and honesty to go to a meeting after being away for so long. 

However, my only real interaction with these types of groups are with my brother who very begrudgingly went to NA for a few months after my parents put him in a rehab program and then once he was financially independent, stopped going to meetings. What did you wish your loved ones told you? Is saying I’m proud patronizing? How can I best support him? Can I ask my boyfriend questions about why he felt like things were out of control or is that too prying? What would be good to ask? And what were you thinking when you told someone you went to a meeting for the first time?

I hope my surprise didn’t come off as apathy, I just wanted to think about what to tell him before I did. This man is the love of my life and I want to be as supportive as possible.",4.8841193118343655,5.230427926565877,5.59681090340359,83.37254859611231,68.87041036717062,8.977999553139197,30.00439413122812,8.939507131559953,2.2135057570566765,1802,65,376,30,29,587,216,463,0.064,0.737,0.19899999999999998,0.997,3,0,2,0,0,0,36.0,1,6,0,10,15,32,1,2,20,0,37,11,1,6,1,65,91,34,0,9,8,2,2,2,0,1,3,5,1,2,23,24,4,2,12,3,2,12,7,6,3,6,30,12,54,26,62,54,7,53,0,1,5,4,68,14,0,7,28,246,77,2,0.07689298045896238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08217521146203617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06149128869236355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05228986348474725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2156536708192757,0.0,0.07224348630332945,0.05912595565251565,0.0,0.0937464943858838,0.0,0.1308605258699227,0.0,0.16138887814355546,0.0,0.08394721955385064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07839751822642155,0.0,0.0,0.0662364940956037,0.0,0.0,0.08624201592756567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04958961119847124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07248785867669734,0.0,0.038879401295606436,0.054932360603826696,0.07382931967017972,0.0,0.0,0.13081025979519226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034681729815296,0.0,0.21850026397129185,0.12898836769245925,0.06149834078047721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07591589900031108,0.0,0.0,0.0866639773888489,0.0,0.05153974396717796,0.0,0.07712992887074906,0.07637207945035407,0.07572409684067775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16051258835131396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05431178609375601,0.07513205247556409,0.0,0.0,0.06804786802519784,0.06457073759353985,0.08602357667090711,0.0,0.0,0.13879783393321332,0.07275799730475778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061375243400519135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08177655704995057,0.14431770657477608,0.0,0.0,0.08754316789577167,0.0,0.08188851467339102,0.10420934712993683,0.05848057656944328,0.0,0.0,0.08538055512894617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06713998463624829,0.08033679874297849,0.0,0.0,0.08668528208486567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14715239535077104,0.0,0.15459736668993582,0.08613773589931206,0.0,0.0,0.17504209155614395,0.1477788367179131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710475746929347,0.0,0.14628566546364358,0.12229676863843415,0.0,0.0,0.12254750011610553,0.07000048151146092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06360666802578899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06515117281572584,0.0591959730084441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428597470343983,0.0,0.08038523843167053,0.0,0.0,0.3490289720071461,0.07247072409152712,0.0,0.11562790371129933,0.061803665038581576,0.06720785411643783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10216855902799052,0.0985398341512658,0.0,0.0,0.04483691526258976,0.0,0.0,0.22042361401447252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06641084685817912,0.0,0.12688952352602104,0.18141388841249548,0.0610340688146897,0.12335782162219512,0.0,0.0,0.21384168972979334,0.06938395492618166,0.0,0.08842313274350662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054622567150660016,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,mangotango1609,2020/03/09,"I’m currently in the hospital watching my mom die from this terrible disease. Everyone talks about the dangers of drug addiction. How terrible it is to OD. How many people they’ve seen go out that way. Let me tell you right now, the death from alcoholic cirrhosis is absolutely torture. I’ve been in the hospital watching my mother steadily decline for 5 days now. She’s been in a coma since Thursday. She can no longer swallow so saliva, bile and sputum from her lungs are building up in her throat and the sound of her trying to breath through all that is something I’ll remember until the day I die. 

And the worst part of all is that my grandma is alive to witness this. My moms brother was an alcoholic too and died pretty much this exact way almost 3 years ago. This will be two children she’s buried because of this disease. 

I know that there is nothing anyone can do or say to make you quit. That is has to be a decision you make yourself. But I just hope that maybe someone will see this and it’ll be a wake up call. Please spare your family this torture.",4.144072966507178,5.706744397129189,4.748394138755981,84.28469647129191,71.53588516746412,7.9044258373205745,29.80891148325359,8.472884824447931,2.226944736842105,845,35,163,14,16,270,132,209,0.172,0.78,0.048,-0.9840000000000001,1,0,4,0,0,0,17.0,0,4,0,1,9,7,3,0,11,0,22,10,4,4,3,21,30,11,5,1,3,4,0,0,0,3,5,2,0,1,15,6,3,0,3,0,0,1,1,6,0,1,4,6,18,1,23,19,5,20,0,0,4,0,19,8,0,3,9,110,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14913011085238054,0.0,0.0,0.12126325334511782,0.29239111167688064,0.13698352723921425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565240562423903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08339084628325646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13968614539155005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17644690275782124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4259244610627773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1586423545147505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13071643787068776,0.0,0.0,0.1289610650490864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774550737088527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13587137054025392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07518065298529181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398853159381311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18262757538891888,0.13869179250495714,0.13743206886717774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320432540602055,0.0,0.0,0.1005623367418101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13126145734439892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14813900118539666,0.0,0.09483857149909487,0.0,0.0,0.15016322372460209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13917283788722276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455016081061473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15496556939532774,0.1168248218747566,0.0,0.1087873322759929,0.0,0.0,0.10901036685717737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131607941326368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11590857819357915,0.10531385345281301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10995312336181157,0.11956756075767057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09287692381866376,0.0,0.13363185692406876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21716791369785374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0880934852104551
alcoholism,WMC164,2020/03/09,"My moms a mentally ill alcoholic Like the title says my moms demons have gotten very bad since I’ve moved home from college. Maybe it’s the fact she’s been alone in her thoughts for the past 4 years. She usually starts drinking around 3pm or 4pm and it ends with her passed out mouth wide open with the TV on at about 9pm give or take. She also had borderline personality disorder and an autoimmune disease, so the big thing is once she’s hit a certain amount of drinks she gets kinda manic and if you don’t agree with every single thing she says you become public enemy number 1 and she’s gonna let you know how big of a piece of shit you are, she also doesn’t listen to what you’re saying and then get pissed when you mention to her it’s your 3rd time saying it. She also just watches the news and allows herself to get more and more frightened. Now she’s thinks she’s Frankie from Grace and Frankie because in her mind acting all drunk and loopy is just being a spacey hippie. And the worst part is when she wakes up, she has no idea any of this happened. A big thing I’ve noticed is she’ll move or break things while intoxicated and wake up the next day and ask my why I did it. (Doesn’t remember anything, last night she barged into my bathroom 3 times cause she couldn’t remember I was taking a shower). Anyway I’ve kinda given up on helping her after being back for a year and a half and I’m moving outta state for a job finally, I’m thinking this is it I don’t want anything to do with her and get fantasy world anymore",4.1668059299191365,4.747767657232707,4.935840071877808,86.64613207547173,70.54088050314465,7.692362982929021,25.20575022461815,7.62386473244151,1.0897787960467205,1217,32,259,13,21,394,187,318,0.11199999999999999,0.841,0.047,-0.9721,2,1,3,0,0,0,16.0,0,6,0,0,14,7,2,0,18,0,22,11,5,3,3,48,44,28,0,3,6,2,0,1,0,2,3,5,2,1,13,23,4,0,7,5,0,5,6,4,0,1,7,6,36,3,30,30,8,44,1,0,1,0,42,17,2,6,21,160,49,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10731519508353156,0.0,0.1040016898696436,0.0,0.24091022795873346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06828697852939898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09958664481043923,0.0,0.0,0.16526920953147978,0.08939238702320029,0.09387630544823516,0.0,0.0,0.07721444645483277,0.08384396998648412,0.06121324882787855,0.1109026466713124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10315588249663077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476063407928051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150865397286119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19674078991173874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08893962420341972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08460562257916468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000187501881058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20985487519373408,0.09632910134803988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08879838906739405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06730737384166291,0.0,0.10072640174911272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11335852883898315,0.0,0.0,0.09964834154345943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05518653693235244,0.08185322761220415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10268314849331976,0.0,0.049058656041099435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10088233665264792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1011966807453339,0.0,0.1013925073354316,0.23521426768828954,0.0,0.32018202097516474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10679457973928456,0.09423451768198347,0.0,0.0,0.11432537834484698,0.0,0.10694078872356144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874178575755504,0.09585935394364364,0.0,0.08768021914337237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22750568874019694,0.0,0.0,0.31942239882357554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10307656985880394,0.08306594977190263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07107564350969033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15100211880331466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2668502739066864,0.12868627092401652,0.0,0.07971985222442053,0.11710787773443153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11059509833963932,0.08285451128739878,0.05922852670371024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09061069057315507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12933046420912392

alcoholism,Approximate_Accuracy,2020/03/09,"What to expect going cold turkey? All advice is much appreciated Hello, fellow perseveres,

I have been self-medicating for PTSD, Panic disorder, Depression, OCD and ADHD for the past \~4 years. 

I guess I would fall into the category of ""functional substance abuser"" as I have been able to hold down a job and not let it affect my personal relationships too much. I developed Panic Disorder over a decade ago and have been on 5 mg diazepam/valium ever since. While it was not optimal, it allowed me to build a career and exit the house. Though sometime in early 2016 a myriad of unfortunate events culminated to the point where my mind ran amuck and I chose to deal with this by not dealing with it. I.E. substances.

For the past 4 years, my ""self-help regimen"" has consisted of 15-20mg valium, 10-20 cigarettes and between 5-8 beers (or equivalent in whiskey or wine) a day. While I never get inebriated to the point where I'm unconscious or puking, on the worst days I make stupid choices and suffer the consequences with a severe hangover the day after. Furthermore, I have recognized my cognitive abilities decline significantly in the last 1.5 years. My memory is so bad I almost forgot the word memory right now and the brain fog has become so thick that it's hard to articulate myself in conversations. In addition, my libido is non-existent, my angst is as bad as ever and my depression has consumed my life: If I don't feel the onset of a panic attack, I am simply numb throughout the day, to which my response is to drink. Drinking makes me feel **something.**

I woke up at 4 am tonight dehydrated from last night's alcohol and simply felt deep inside of me that I have had enough. This is not the first time I have told myself those words, but I am ready to try. I won't quit the benzos overnight due to the obvious dangers with that but would love any sort of feedback from people who may have worn similar shoes sometime in their life. Will quitting the aforementioned alcohol dosage cold turkey after 4 years pose a risk in terms of seizures? I am also curious as to whether I can expect to see my cognition improve at a recognizable pace (trying to find motivators to keep me straight), or is it more likely that I will get a lot worse before I get better?",6.960420560747664,7.226788294392524,7.601285981308415,71.05773271028039,64.42056074766353,11.147065420560748,32.77420560747664,10.878246069084,3.6679079252336457,1802,67,318,46,25,599,245,428,0.129,0.816,0.055,-0.9672,2,0,9,0,1,0,59.0,0,0,1,6,10,17,3,4,28,0,35,13,2,5,5,57,54,28,0,5,12,0,5,1,1,6,5,0,0,1,16,16,7,3,5,5,0,3,7,14,0,1,11,8,39,3,54,36,8,56,0,3,1,1,11,24,0,10,30,215,55,4,0.08822987897027426,0.10453797912319868,0.0,0.0,0.10603516885829517,0.08621721659550649,0.07821046422087496,0.1885818163992647,0.08834947900911776,0.0,0.0,0.07055740233595104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0599993432312543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10037422460757416,0.0,0.0,0.14733652715134474,0.0,0.09744296945312744,0.07507712856605744,0.0,0.0,0.07803215802414465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984937243037131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22760389144021564,0.1819222621147358,0.15198453094517822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2022381703563461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17286338385026806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09116505030959804,0.0,0.0,0.15961795356902433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08922335563722457,0.0,0.08471452010413523,0.0,0.08064051095980214,0.07504828997986072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13828941062401956,0.0,0.05014307347716563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719515881026614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07903664144299669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059138628067745974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018054343613903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08755454078433511,0.0784227703468418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438382544917043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09022102900429456,0.12463874556843213,0.04310466220154608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07500988797019745,0.07963091049513528,0.0,0.1177882586577927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09800350553354603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08908702624874466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12971822580627754,0.0,0.06804832186138181,0.0,0.0,0.08279776455768738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3105562583466441,0.0,0.0,0.1684508057920537,0.06116748890019354,0.07703892713176536,0.0,0.0,0.16681150808812312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10313600702109987,0.0,0.0,0.1876866734307152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09472587090362818,0.0,0.0753478345607458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07030779037837004,0.0,0.18408601197520966,0.09967464959982296,0.0,0.07298466762662285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06792367135320071,0.1745232126675297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08668540812073093,0.0,0.05144755195345852,0.0,0.0,0.08430743036449513,0.0,0.11980459251890893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08991378436014681,0.12535194916317455,0.0,0.0,0.2272685973065844

alcoholism,twozon,2020/03/09,"Super scared Tomorrow, I'll go in for a detox at a hospital.  


The local one, about 30 minutes from here, doesn't have the competence to deal with this stuff, so they'll most likely send me to another hospital, about 2-3 hours away.  


Lately, in maybe the last two months, I've just been sitting or laying in my bed, and sipping wine, to fend off withdrawals. I feel so fatigued - maybe because of thiamine deficiency, plus that I've barely eaten. Maybe half a meal a day.  


Detox is absolute hell... 5-6 days of agony, as I know from experience... (too many times)  


(I'm aware this might break rule #1 of this sub, but I don't feel intoxicated at all, but the opposite, extreme anticipation anxiety - I try not to drink so much, but it's extremely hard to do this on your own)  


I'm sick of this, and it's not getting any better. I have postponed reaching for help way too long.

alcoholism,Kgb415,2020/03/09,"Panic attacks at 1 month sober? My husband has about a month sober (I think).  He’s been SO anxious.  Says he’s scared he’ll get the shakes, or have a seizure.   

I told him that at 1 month sober - that’s just irrational.  He gets it, but is still super scared.  He took an Ativan tonight and it helped.  But he was still so freaked out.

I have no idea what’s normal, or common.

alcoholism,jasoncb123,2020/03/09,"Does anyone else feel isolated and in a box. Yes. I have had my battles with booze.  All the different kinds of it. Beer Liquor Wine and now seltzer’s.  I checked myself into rehab a year ago. Came out better and happier. 

I have not been perfect and I have admitted it to my spouse and others my fallings and have up until a few months ago really made an attempt to go to meetings as well. I’m just exhausted of all of it. 

I don’t drink anything near the amount I used too anymore and  even if I have a few and I feel like I’m always under a microscope . Maybe that’s me interpreting others thoughts. 

When I admit that I have had anything my wife just says ....whyyyyyy?  I don’t fucking know. I just tell her it’s a work in progress and harder then she gets. I can tell she really has no idea what it’s like though. 

Recently I’ve just gotten very tired of people who think they know what this addiction is like. They don’t. 

All I feel is pissed off when people say someone is an alcoholic and they have zero fucking insight into that person. Is some one who smokes to much a cigarettaholic??  Is some one who eats too much a foodaholic??  Should they NEVER eat again?? Is someone who hoards stuff a hoardaholic???  Is someone who collects valuable cars a caraholic??   

I do my best not to judge others who struggle. I just wish others would try to be more open and understanding of those of us who do, instead of labeling faults of others instead of always assuming we just suck and are weak.

alcoholism,TooCoolforSkewl2321,2020/03/09,"I believe my drink was spiked I went to a bar last week with my friend and remember when I came home because I went to bed.  The next day I woke up with severe disorientation and confusion that I thought was just a bad hang over.  Its been exactly a week now and I still feel disoriented.  I can barely even concentrate long enough to type this up.  I don't think my drink was spiked with drugs because my friend was with my the whole time and was watching our drinks and nobody came up to us.  I believe there was methanol in the shots or something because I don't remember hallucinating or have the side effects of the date rape drugs, just trouble concentrating like I have alcohol poisoning.

alcoholism,Warm_Mud,2020/03/10,"Locked out of room and its my fault. I'm sober. Im not sure if thats the term to use. But i do no drink, not even a sip. I learned early on what that did to me and know I'm not a good person when I drink. My partner however, drinks every chance she can. On a day off of work, on a day of work. I know its unhealthy and ive tried my share of being understanding, being strict. Nothing works and today is to the point, i dont think I can handle one more day.

I get off work M-F at 5pm every week. Its always the same. I don't have a car due to some money issues and my partner always makes sure i get a ride home. 5:20 comes around. No ride, no call, no text. So i find a ride home. 
Get home and the chain is on the door and its the ONLY way into my apartmenr since im on the third floor. I called and text over 20 times no response. 
Decide ill walk get some food come back. I go eat and walk back. Time is now 7pm.

alcoholism,weezleweez,2020/03/10,"Do I have a problem with alcohol? So I’ve been worried for a while now that I might be addicted to alcohol. The issue is I don’t really see it as a “problem.” Other than worrying about long term health concerns, I don’t notice any effects of my daily life. I get up every day and do well at my job, I’m there for my wife and family, I am social, I keep up with things around the house, etc. Basically I am living the life I want to, but I rarely go a day without a drink. Most of the time it’s a few beers after work, sometimes it’s several glasses of wine or bourbon, but I never lose control. I’m not aggressive or confrontational. I just drink. I haven’t gone more than 4-5 days without a drink in probably 10 years. 

I think I should stop because that can’t be good for me, but I really don’t want to. I’ve been telling myself I’m not an alcoholic because I am fully functioning and honestly my life is going great. But I’m honestly not sure if I could give up alcohol today if I needed to. 

Can anyone give me advice? Am I killing myself? Where do I go from here?",2.0830432645034413,3.3587789070796497,4.552684365781712,84.78491642084565,76.3008849557522,8.031071779744346,25.387413962635197,8.680891452615391,1.7541561455260577,827,29,179,17,18,292,127,226,0.085,0.772,0.142,0.9225,1,0,9,0,0,1,26.0,0,0,0,4,9,12,3,0,12,0,23,14,0,2,2,36,40,14,1,9,14,1,0,0,0,2,9,0,0,0,7,6,9,3,2,5,0,4,11,6,1,0,3,1,29,6,26,32,5,24,0,1,1,0,5,7,0,6,13,124,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131714702976578,0.0,0.10144484142798836,0.0,0.4437780113124757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07059638550422961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07258844857105047,0.0,0.0,0.09241556078976636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12656685667703918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643508315641887,0.08288621625807527,0.0,0.0,0.2008523493387961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30509159172351225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11577891311888397,0.0,0.0,0.08746691208269855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09786563732393302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05423799671682896,0.19917373767282665,0.17699792472312836,0.08707340127053867,0.0,0.11445417565386573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11034834198426137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11978623937434067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083537784415565,0.10301836288496154,0.09227374550379012,0.11485367990474217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21997853118988245,0.0,0.0,0.09166876225025626,0.0918712194620492,0.0,0.11614016898100088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11012916511133376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697600839416406,0.0800669691420817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181917644675845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1119279495239122,0.19867000098564236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330105050455596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272550341711822,0.0,0.0,0.11727911689011004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10582425844213468,0.0,0.0,0.10267369055546254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679229874071122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09784250397265766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09073711924109462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896873025548808,0.06651916505093584,0.0,0.0,0.0605341827985758,0.0,0.09840256539936623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122463169232844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933403354071748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20014401403777635,0.0,0.07557708499602624,0.21085423841083195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06685215472535158
alcoholism,alcoholhelp961489,2020/03/10,"Came home to significant other in withdrawal the tl;dr: Firstly, not seeking specific medical advice, seeking advice on handling situation at home. Aka, where do I draw a line or take a stand, how do I be supportive without being destructive. 

How we got here: Their drinking previously had worsened to on the order of a 2-3 half gallons of vodka per week, maybe more, over the last 2 months. For the previous 8+ months before that, ikt was more like 1 half gallon per week. Now they are very ill, sweaty, unable to eat or sleep.

Details: I recently returned from being on a work trip. Significant other is in substantial withdrawal symptoms and I am having a hard time handling/supporting it.  The first couple nights they claimed they were “tapering” but ended up so drunk they fell/couldn’t walk. They were taking shots of vodka essentially 24 hrs a day “because they need them” and “can’t stop cold turkey” - I estimate near a pint of vodka yesterday and probably nearly a quart in the previous days. I understand completely stopping suddenly is dangerous, but I don’t know how to actually convince them they aren’t drinking less and that they need to.

As of last night, I got rid of \*most\* of the alcohol in the house and took them to a free clinic - they have no insurance. By good/terrible luck, the clinic confirmed alcohol withdrawals and prescribed them a small number of low dose alprazolam (12 @ 0.5mg). They are a larger person \~230lbs. They claim the doctors literally said “take these and taper” with no specific schedule or further advice, which I don’t buy.  

Today is the first day they had the prescription filled, and the first day they’ve gone 12 hours w/o a drink (afaik). Some symptoms are very obviously real(sweaty, red face, unable to eat) some I can’t tell if they’re exaggerated (seeing/hearing things). They immediately took 3 of the 12 alprazolam and are still asking for alcohol saying they’re going to die from seizures.  I’m providing lots of water and trying to get them to sleep without giving more alcohol just yet (again, it’s only been roughly 12 hours since their last 2 drinks). 

Advice on handling this in general is much appreciated. I’ve read everything I can and will continue reading on this sub for stories that will help. Thanks in advance.",5.4910836071559,7.604470404819281,6.090449069003288,73.79590726542536,69.04819277108436,9.271266885724717,31.852866009492523,9.725611199111238,3.4156184738955826,1818,80,300,44,33,590,238,415,0.08800000000000001,0.825,0.087,-0.5036,1,0,11,0,0,0,69.0,1,0,20,6,11,9,2,0,26,0,30,23,3,3,1,40,51,22,1,3,10,0,2,1,0,2,12,2,2,1,12,14,12,2,2,10,2,9,10,3,0,6,13,6,32,7,46,33,9,65,0,1,1,0,28,20,0,9,35,192,44,4,0.0,0.0,0.07489132811387643,0.0,0.0,0.2999744140597675,0.0,0.3280651017887557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07174552419733184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04678258911030055,0.0,0.06530371351627083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08777498952794964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08046489739882064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08491606495062506,0.0,0.19797479746075455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07964842642417977,0.0,0.0,0.07855100293057407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3007206352192505,0.0,0.15705707618619158,0.0,0.0,0.06797263622508708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689727931691263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2611145163560008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04009570880066827,0.07362008803684714,0.04361553202313822,0.06436944490879372,0.12275879227464866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06874778362814413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08649635960056541,0.0,0.051440060359838856,0.0,0.1539615019891474,0.0,0.1511552760005699,0.088552573159297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042176638736920735,0.18767044658098567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037493369357469206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06524522618873753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07709992517107515,0.0,0.0,0.07731176891818857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12251307368282892,0.0,0.05641586204538115,0.11380979402038086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14403858005052633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05836746861851079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06701012842529203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08274329330777433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1535300579086456,0.08735177032403002,0.0,0.0,0.07577569910995674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07300136634381738,0.06103011653085206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06348364564283594,0.08626376467345799,0.15359936930959495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06128806586332155,0.12832327693136905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17417695554341311,0.0,0.15953334378782075,0.17310639969356492,0.0,0.06707786663834492,0.07065580449009154,0.0,0.0,0.050985476825656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04475019567278778,0.0,0.07274458583142115,0.0,0.1705313952225284,0.052104315503386886,0.0,0.0,0.0798934820947051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12664410504961826,0.0,0.0,0.12311923385077303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14795745770170698,0.0,0.05587073593121437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Charlie_redmoon,2020/03/10,more of a habit than a necessity In my case it seems more of a habit to me where I most alway get buzzed every night.  I get the feeling if I will be missing something if I don't have a drink.  If I can structure the evening so I only have a single drink then I'm fine with that.  Also when I get a buzz on I like to work out on piano and do a couple hits of weed.   Then I binge eat.  I find the buzzed state a place of expanded insight into life and my personality-which to me is a good thing. Something I would not otherwise experience.   It's just the cumulative effect of overeating and over drinking that I fight against.  It disrupts the following day because of lessened energy.,2.4223141486810564,4.191377460431653,4.208075539568345,85.52395983213431,76.55395683453237,6.9354916067146295,25.971822541966425,7.793537801064563,1.4302944844124699,533,20,111,8,12,180,88,139,0.039,0.873,0.08800000000000001,0.6124,0,0,5,0,1,0,10.0,0,0,0,2,6,5,1,0,14,0,9,5,0,1,0,18,18,11,0,4,5,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,6,6,4,0,5,3,0,1,2,2,0,0,0,1,16,3,19,14,4,16,0,1,0,0,1,9,0,5,6,83,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15292698892694168,0.15911912342257184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165723585710934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21159294857605476,0.0,0.12332787430395392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5619993632009175,0.0,0.1956765770075037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12630596414974407,0.0,0.16111997257589095,0.0,0.0,0.18706015648619745,0.0,0.0,0.09669190381039633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17478124361629188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2997301837519196,0.0,0.0,0.16039509902366622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350717815025028,0.09342557947086796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17945690182016974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14543943826285524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19979520665533126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740890960106548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2944372154589792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12704506953271447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13921810627557532,0.0,0.0,0.1358446846609589,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,MargotPowers,2020/03/10,"I drank vodka religiously from age 19 to 24. I drank vodka heavily if not daily from the ages 19 to 24. It was my coping mechanism for every emotion I had. Time to celebrate? Vodka. Bad day at work? Vodka. I didn't go out without getting drunk first. I didn't see my group of friends or my high school sweetheart without being drunk. I had become irritable, euphoric, estatic, reckless, suicidal; mixed emotions every day, almost manic.

I began taking antidepressants on the 2nd year out of 5 of my alcohol era. Its crazy how I avoided the real problem and had tried everything else in every direction to feel better back then. I had lost my loving high school sweetheart, dropped out of college, and lost good friends through my own reckless behavior. Medication and alcohol is a dangerous combination.

I was so neurotic, anxious, and unhappy all that time but hid It well. It had just got so much worse near the end when my comfort zone at work had been disrupted. I had quit my job Oct 2019. My first thought walking out was being worried about all my free time. If I didn't stop drinking and deal with this now I will die.

It was one of the hardest things I had ever done. Mind you, before all of this I had quit smokin, quit a meth addiction, and worked 70 hour weeks of physical labor... underweight. Those were all a piece of cake before this.

I had terrible insomnia. I would not sleep for days at a time since I had quit last year. I had fits of rage that whole month of Nov. The drop of a pen would set me off. I was sweating almost constantly. I was crying so much. I see things out of the corners of my eyes. Still do. Instant confusion. Can't remember what I had done one minute to the next. Talking sober is hard. This wave passes, but the psychosis aspect is still effecting me.

This is the first time I had truly felt like myself in a long time. 5 years. It's a breath of fresh air. I draw again. I play video games, cook, and study spanish. I remember time spent with my fiance. Going back to college next year. I scrambled my brain but it's healing.

I look so drained now. I guess from the stress of It all. I'm only 24 but typing all that out it was a living hell OMG. Wasted my early 20's in misery and loneliness. Wish I had got help sooner. I'll always be an alcoholic. That's why I don't drink now. Much love. ❤",1.4082828282828288,3.9555109651416136,2.8838993860170348,89.25063814616756,85.31808278867103,5.952560903149139,22.506674589027533,7.348242739294969,1.0499460566448802,1819,65,361,30,55,592,244,459,0.17600000000000002,0.7,0.124,-0.9788,1,1,10,0,0,0,69.0,0,1,0,14,18,24,3,3,20,0,42,21,5,2,7,54,65,22,2,6,12,0,3,1,4,3,7,0,0,0,22,16,10,2,6,12,2,4,9,11,1,5,39,7,50,14,47,20,12,70,1,2,4,2,12,20,1,7,44,233,72,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0788272856447042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23182841025587045,0.1448136740271496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06016672975754168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816883833261172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11120203655830596,0.06037484333378236,0.0,0.07985940931902052,0.12305895795873815,0.0,0.0,0.06395127409057683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08072055571242172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07814014491474514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07942784206120096,0.13989961844709609,0.07454721708502153,0.0,0.0,0.07504513779580615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14799405338014546,0.0,0.14167022828476056,0.0,0.0,0.06040473961957876,0.1626753772365946,0.06404415103808367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0654074663378601,0.18276989540920904,0.0,0.06498650381330523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03656151140835829,0.0,0.06942780555876621,0.0,0.0,0.18451753292710912,0.0,0.0,0.1117312280279335,0.0,0.03777837337227286,0.0,0.08218953613175567,0.060649206517826376,0.11566393581758225,0.0,0.07965631604638179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647744987208449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048467077018821934,0.15279647412587308,0.0,0.0,0.0712096209887093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07175534519807968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05894133822918809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03532643639279918,0.0,0.0638500117352189,0.06399102918796434,0.06072119632765793,0.0,0.15786723484508586,0.0,0.1305230641341707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07284352763988372,0.0,0.0,0.07301129403322475,0.0,0.0577162092779558,0.0,0.15946590527165275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15380249818074748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979966539345684,0.05499411503676346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06918977404614053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3076373177325777,0.0,0.08230326617833056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16382359181522374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463607699630233,0.11524153341494744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05981460210744916,0.0,0.072361039336793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11549183215388988,0.06045341026850772,0.08282950759807035,0.0,0.0,0.07909411154108417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05436723277350153,0.05811908952007973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960775323692941,0.0,0.0,0.057405125132046486,0.2951469760291328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04909294147110447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0580017728187057,0.0,0.0650143120166403,0.0,0.06524746202502035,0.08073021386287163,0.0831515730395218,0.13940624190123296,0.0,0.15792504378108654,0.07343311541721306,0.07368886384453928,0.10273222042945157,0.0,0.0,0.1862580342073479
alcoholism,myfavoritefoodispeas,2020/03/10,"At what age did you realize your drinking was a legitimate problem? Most people (or I guess maybe it just seems that way) start drinking fairly early and it usually escalates in college but never becomes an actual problem for them. I've just recently started college and was having  some problems and went to my college's referral center and ended up being referred off campus for substance abuse disorder because the school says there's nothing they can provide. I only have my parents insurance and there's no way I can do anything through that. And paying out of pocket is a no go too. I've been to a couple of AA meetings in the area but they didn't really seem to help. I'm just worried and don't want anything to escalate until a point of no return. Has anyone else had similar experiences?

alcoholism,harlemlovesong,2020/03/10,"Advice wanted for staging an intervention Cross-posted to r/mentalillness

Long story short, my dad is an alcoholic. Tale as old as time, right? He has been since I was a kid. The way he got on the wagon was when I was 10, my mom took me and threatened to leave him. When she killed herself, he started drinking again. When my brother was murdered, he started drinking more. 

He is drunk nearly everyday. He yells and screams and breaks things. He threatens to hurt people. We have had interventions (once with his therapist that has since moved and he hasn't gone to see another one). He admits he has a problem and promises to get help but then he keeps drinking.

My therapist told me to go no contact. I did that with my mom (emotional abuse) and she died. I did that with my brother (emotional abuse, threatening to kill me) and he died. I don't want to leave my dad but I can't keep listening to him when he keeps saying he will get help and he doesn't. He lives as my grandma's caretaker; she is in the hospital right now for a broken hip. I help when I can but he needs to take the first step to getting treatment.

I called SAMSA and a couple of other hotlines so here is my game plan which I am going to outline to my dad tomorrow.
1. I'm not taking him to any store anymore. He does this thing where he will ask me to take him to get medicine or food, and then he will buy alcohol. 
2. When he yells and screams and breaks things, when he threatens violence and emotionally abuses people, I am going to call the nonemergency line for the cops in order to make documentation of the problem. He doesn't get to get away with threatening people and scaring them any more. If they put him in the county drunk tank, then that's his business. 
3. I am going to see about hiring a professional interventionist. They run about 3000-8000 dollars but surely I can find one with a payment plan. 
4. If he escalates and I become afraid he will hurt himself or others and not just talk, I am going to petition to have him forcibly committed. 

Like I've talked and begged and pleaded and cried and I'm done. He tells me he'll get help and then he doesn't. I know it's a disease and I know he is struggling but he has always been firm when it came to me getting the mental help I needed. The biggest fight he ever had with my mom was putting me in therapy. He might hate me for this but I can't trust him when he says he will get help. 

I'm almost in tears so I guess if you have any advice I'd appreciate it",1.8705952380952369,4.060038964285717,3.208263492063492,90.0145142857143,79.99206349206351,6.254222222222222,23.17523809523809,7.404127859558343,0.9237093333333336,1954,66,410,28,50,635,228,504,0.195,0.74,0.065,-0.9972,0,0,5,0,4,1,56.0,1,1,3,3,19,18,5,3,19,0,43,9,1,1,3,64,88,51,5,9,14,8,0,1,0,7,2,7,0,1,15,30,8,3,4,6,3,13,10,14,0,3,17,9,58,4,48,64,2,55,0,2,2,0,82,13,0,8,25,245,73,3,0.0,0.2408992416217196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13245369301375068,0.0,0.14485713528952832,0.06786472141347459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05639244195392574,0.0,0.0,0.1382635899740947,0.07106574444494278,0.0,0.0,0.06721245798000589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06335846786753369,0.0,0.06367482530947463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07484979028518941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13840731850575216,0.07751408768418369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07498937157130235,0.07444529544836054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406750406454954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05930847941419914,0.06935515772917612,0.0,0.1991747804145785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2287060092458593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061304424615977876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061943158831332036,0.057647553207589235,0.0819512015388712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31867666108582743,0.0,0.19258436781455407,0.0,0.05420414083530955,0.0,0.07465943715091296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06691166019812844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725602842442441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451044793489484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18071887423961144,0.14996123849630402,0.0,0.07449237398625481,0.0,0.0,0.1435233290776333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03311039210121386,0.0,0.05984466988725575,0.05997684124758201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04523890491060187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06829909437413675,0.07189628581494703,0.0,0.2381242351329793,0.0,0.072031816018804,0.0,0.100505421879949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07111620745223059,0.0721758754109326,0.09184927685040747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409554863366552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06490765797722134,0.0,0.0,0.12969893269670826,0.0,0.13626087030122713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11575529044253607,0.0,0.10779138407398042,0.06785244782530417,0.0,0.1080123767732153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11212480688029036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09593994680491877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085089987360135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387511086056841,0.0,0.15287025058849674,0.1089465023405328,0.059236459773282124,0.0,0.07750416261459839,0.1573790093048166,0.13507581405152005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03951889495993971,0.0,0.0,0.06475986433583727,0.07529813215173405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07994836797380446,0.0537949352746382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,elizataylor13,2020/03/10,"Functioning Alcoholic I’m a highly functioning alcoholic. On most days I am binging after work but there are days where I can abstain drinking completely. On those days, I feel like I have it under control only to realize that I don’t the next day. I feel guilty about not having a severe case of alcoholism, but at the same time when I do drink, it’s out of control and I cannot limit what I’m taking in. I’ve had a problem since 2012. I also have a three month old baby who I feel like is being affected by this. My husband doesn’t drink really at all and has no idea about the severity. 

I’m wondering if anyone else has had this type of experience? My best friend is a recovering alcoholic and she’s four years sober. I’ve been to AA meetings with her but have excused it as just being there to support her. I feel like I would be super shamed for going to AA and I almost feel too good for it as fucked up as that sounds.

I don’t know where to go from here. I feel like I’m ruining my marriage and failing my newborn child. I dunno, I guess I’m just looking for advice or how to cope with being a functioning alcoholic. Anyone relate to this? My first time posting. I feel dumb but hoping maybe I can connect and get some encouragement.",2.3142687747035566,4.285150703557317,4.091304347826089,85.32217391304351,77.53754940711462,7.245849802371541,24.04347826086957,8.18289091462,1.4864134387351773,980,33,197,18,23,330,142,253,0.125,0.7070000000000001,0.168,0.9125,0,0,8,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,8,13,17,2,1,9,0,25,9,0,4,1,45,48,18,0,4,9,1,7,4,1,1,5,1,0,2,12,9,8,4,11,3,0,2,6,6,2,3,3,9,27,11,31,40,5,27,0,2,1,1,12,11,2,9,17,137,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266059776387138,0.0,0.5066883542800207,0.0949522132629149,0.0,0.0,0.07583045864015915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326058366431605,0.0971580607829123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951159675863484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09942081914356556,0.0,0.2127056290707199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24461370323723536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786733052552441,0.0,0.0,0.07921301295585922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09275574938851948,0.0,0.0,0.3356198944951919,0.270968209472058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065696951590857,0.0,0.0,0.07326053608616216,0.08766295957090238,0.04954145648562944,0.0,0.10778095943204108,0.07953359971279461,0.0,0.0,0.10445896853022577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10018641882051373,0.0,0.09418130494868347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704438709974058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05211261192769952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853042315083588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07962800504877968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526312670757538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07568735271587748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008460541156458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09950149585544683,0.0,0.0,0.07211767775737887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09081486896704136,0.0,0.0,0.09073345075977206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060746474305176414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21424752453224935,0.0,0.0784391238423813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10760478268075407,0.0,0.0,0.07129560264946018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058489489079036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283223063238298,0.06903276474589265,0.0,0.0,0.06736001809719484,0.0,0.0,0.0610633377849101
alcoholism,Random_Marcher,2020/03/10,"Started drinking I turned 21 about two months ago. What used be be 1-2 beers a week turned into two beers a day, everyday. 

I just heard alcoholism is hereditary. My grandfather and dad were former alcoholics, and my great-grandfather died from alcoholism (liver cancer). 

Should I be concerned? Should I be thinking about cutting back?",3.8772413793103446,7.185781810344827,3.716810344827589,81.32797413793107,84.34482758620689,7.727586206896553,27.9396551724138,8.472884824447931,2.988062068965517,267,12,42,7,8,81,42,58,0.102,0.898,0.0,-0.6662,0,0,6,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,0,2,0,8,8,1,1,0,8,14,2,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,2,4,1,0,0,1,3,6,0,1,3,0,0,0,1,0,2,2,1,6,0,4,6,0,9,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,8,27,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1711932750852363,0.6191742836305021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14850087020880662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12454936812469156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20043280883212614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1891885511641364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21292051555059316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15415018588146268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13669456165840735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12374642371697415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.420128140884436,0.3773092773198978,0.0,0.0,0.16679761774512286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15491287756614303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Max151945,2020/03/10,"Dating an alcoholic who's in jail for DUI I've been dating a wonderful guy for 5 years who was arrested Friday night for DUI. Had an empty container of vodka in his car and refused a breathalyzer. Apparently he was wasted. His brother bailed him out. It was his third DUI. Which is a felony in our state. And unfortunately his last DUI had yet to go to court. I'm in a state of shock, his family is in a state of shock and we are trying our best to figure out how to help him, etc. He hid his drinking from all of us. I only see him once a week, every weekend, and he barely touches a glass of wine. I recently found out about DUIs 1 &amp; 2 I had told him that I could not be in a relationship with him until he admitted his problem and got help. That conversation happened last Saturday and a week later he had another DUI. He is still not admitting he has a problem. He called me tonight from jail, first time we have spoken, and I told him please not to call me and to focus on himself and his family and figuring out how the hell he was going to deal with all of this. This is a deal breaker for me but I'm feeling tremendously guilty. Maybe I was too harsh? Our relationship was already strained and almost dead, he knew and I had given him an ultimatum. I will support him from behind the scenes, supporting the efforts of his family. I want to help him but maybe I'm doing it all wrong by being tough on him. I don't know.",2.63843607305936,4.219535537671234,4.470753424657534,84.6796689497717,75.47260273972603,7.880365296803652,24.15296803652968,8.59863814320734,1.5400885844748855,1115,35,235,22,24,379,151,292,0.149,0.7659999999999999,0.084,-0.9565,1,0,4,0,0,0,30.0,6,0,0,3,6,11,1,1,17,0,25,3,0,2,3,46,46,17,1,4,5,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,9,20,3,2,9,4,0,3,4,8,0,2,18,3,39,3,40,24,5,36,1,0,1,0,55,12,1,2,18,159,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12364798558493136,0.11585671742419575,0.0,0.12767769509957946,0.0,0.0,0.12536077209256294,0.0,0.0,0.12132141267529155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12141988638192748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23628502785510214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09237693992775688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23856299268977316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11334183540382815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12903595054674882,0.0,0.0,0.09748213934596926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3272146506935217,0.0,0.05850133593110182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09841425917710857,0.0,0.12685894699362327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13150981669116865,0.0,0.0925357637544341,0.0,0.0,0.11456107192179026,0.10231302214773874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2326535729834592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06358562846372677,0.18862168959383607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2324721619988935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085765000461984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12321659660814704,0.0,0.08799497269316581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12700372467549634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2214183198971888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11423967377388584,0.2484367441920038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09219782497807114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09239807395638136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2625897063824462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06746553070475199,0.0,0.0,0.22111238789515328,0.0,0.07855262406330492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13917271039071846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06824278715028807,0.0,0.1856149303221005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254715848854136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12649965636411725,0.0,0.07450692961875006
alcoholism,Purple_Window,2020/03/10,"Is my drinking becoming a problem? Today my girlfriend and I broke up. She was shaken, and the people we were with the Friday before were also disturbed, by my behavior.

Friday, I went out for some drinks with friends from the office at 6:30, and my SO and I planned to meet with a different group of friends after. My office friends and I each had 4 drinks over the course of 3 hours. I thought it wasn't too overboard. I moved to the UK from the US two years ago, and there drinking culture is a bit heavier, so I thought of that amount of alcohol over that amount of time was fairly normal for a Friday night. By the time I was about to head over to my SO and our friend group at about 10, I was fairly tipsy. I admit, very energetic and loud. 

Generally, while sober, I am usually a very energetic, enthusiastic person. I talk with my hands, I can be sort of loud (my Americaness showing), and I like to crack jokes and make people laugh. 

Those drinks previously were from a craft brewery, so the ABV levels must've been higher, because apparently I went overboard that night. 

My SO was relating my behavior back to me today, and it was really bad. I was all over the place, in people's faces, 0-100 depressed to uncannily happy, making everyone around me very uncomfortable. Keep in mind, they just started their night. 

The worst part was my SO telling me that--while I didn't seem to mean to--I would clap her on the back when she was sitting beside me in a way that I saw as comraderey at the time, but was too drunk to realize it was very hard and actually left a mark later. I physically hurt her by accident, and she told me today that not only was she scared for me--alcohol poisoning, lack of self-respect, etc.--but she was also scared . . . . of me. I was unpredictable, sporadic, crazy. Not malicious or mean. Just out of control. And capable of harm.

She told me to go sleep at my own place that Friday, so I got a kebab and crashed in my bed. That night, I was drunk enough that I didn't sense any discomfort on her part or on anyone else's. But after I left, they all started talking, ""wow he is wasted very early. I hope he's okay. That was all very uncomfortable."" 

The next day, I got a long text from her about it and my heart sunk. We didn't talk about it until Monday, today. She said she didn't know how to cope with me acting like that. It disturbed her. Despite her describing how I was, I'm scared to actually see what I was like, observing myself that night from a table over. 

Anyway. I have not touched any alcohol for three days. I think my alcohol habits are fairly reasonable. I used to be the guy who would be most drunk at a get together, but I feel like I've matured over the past couple years. I don't usually drink more than 2 times a week these days. I never drink alone, always with other people, and try to make sure I don't drink more than the people around me. 

I don't know what to do though concerning alcohol. I'm ashamed. Is this just a relapse? Should I cut it out completely? If try to be more moderate, how do I know I won't have another horrible night like this? I feel like I can live without alcohol, but it seems like the social thing to do where I live.",3.237982796892344,4.8375574135220125,4.357491675915654,86.03301331853498,73.92138364779875,7.755530891601925,25.04920458749537,8.435331408891425,1.5271892711801702,2489,80,516,44,51,813,277,636,0.121,0.773,0.107,-0.9343,2,1,14,0,0,0,102.0,4,0,3,2,30,34,2,7,31,1,52,22,5,9,5,86,86,41,0,8,14,0,5,7,5,4,6,3,1,2,28,31,16,2,15,13,0,5,14,16,0,2,38,10,88,18,80,40,18,77,0,3,2,0,44,30,0,9,47,349,116,0,0.0,0.0,0.10347150476921432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046995289020717694,0.3399464657583469,0.0,0.054908358001805685,0.0,0.08479339813058036,0.04411337487657194,0.0,0.0,0.07210509499708204,0.055591666488636296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037069865139149484,0.054320930384018834,0.0,0.0943905660659564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08153172268964679,0.04426596073660797,0.032317926615496505,0.058551762326254336,0.045112522869615285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05787949936450824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055586035290337836,0.0,0.05946170382535895,0.0,0.058660950745601126,0.0,0.10257237410967247,0.0,0.0456624125019607,0.0,0.0,0.05539020489902054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.415482238397164,0.0,0.0,0.04428788026037247,0.0,0.0,0.05477947139897309,0.05912660732889698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05065884848073792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05361274130438528,0.07574896578011282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638394364220256,0.0,0.027698556220587714,0.0,0.030130088779316024,0.0,0.08480312260583191,0.0,0.0,0.05249395603315361,0.0,0.0564362822411958,0.0474917243471504,0.0,0.05440948398970779,0.0,0.0,0.06282395301011011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05265663052934527,0.05220986279547275,0.0,0.056754487587359626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04712286002863938,0.0,0.0,0.08740825645889662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11520359734015677,0.0,0.0,0.18130582076675225,0.0,0.0936278077568666,0.04691729583246117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616533185195996,0.0,0.0,0.1154994502056512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05353082337847273,0.0,0.0,0.056347382609781727,0.0,0.0,0.04088903684574861,0.0,0.05638288208900155,0.2985103014861755,0.051944206801754586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040320888677151036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11482184394533147,0.050609559621162585,0.18377232817708355,0.0462913330392558,0.11078040979804107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050728940270185166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03396326537619029,0.05450905026003981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05043014602650557,0.0,0.15923412944182558,0.0,0.04224671164089109,0.0965271475741695,0.05530701948664058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05305406605254629,0.054042909941251306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07504968205671267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049966744000499684,0.0,0.0,0.12783622412997878,0.046338127341156166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035221327631583546,0.033970370302010326,0.05208773338830649,0.08417721272175573,0.12365570758578084,0.0,0.20101103690791025,0.10131769696147584,0.0,0.07198846736844558,0.0,0.05178871228737859,0.0,0.0637714541048703,0.045788610855165814,0.11677878043114978,0.26246141809053664,0.0,0.04208145744371047,0.04252605980361776,0.0,0.0,0.09829231597822637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0511053187858554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07532177617047514,0.0,0.0,0.06828084657311953
alcoholism,Programanites,2020/03/11,"Looking for support I've been staring at my phone trying to figure out what to say.  I know I need help and have seen how supportive everyone is on this subreddit.  I've lost jobs and been extremely unreliable to the people I care about.  Addiction runs in my family and has caused recent tragedy in our lives, and because of that I'm afraid to admit it and ask for help.  I feel like this is the first time I've been able to be honest.

alcoholism,butcherman480,2020/03/11,"Struggling, bad. A couple weeks ago, I fell, hard, off the wagon and had a drink.  Well, a lot of them.

I had a small detox period and was doing great again, but my mother was just admitted to hospital with a severe infection coming from a tiny little cut on her right index finger.  It's spread, very quickly through her hand and into her arm, and they fear there might be sepsis, in her blood.  She isn't doing well now, and I can't be there with her, because where I work, I'm exposed to all kinds of possible infectious things, and she is on isolation atm.

So I'm sitting here, at home, freaking out.  She was already not well, COPD, CHF, renal insufficiency, and HTN.  So this could be bad, in a big way.  The call to run to the store and grab a metric fuck-ton of alcohol, and drink till I pass out is loud, and I don't know how much longer I can resist.

I know it won't help me, or even more, won't help her, but I don't know how else to stop myself from overthinking it and freaking out.

Any ideas, please?",4.783550724637682,4.441116111111112,5.559722222222224,85.92625000000002,69.04830917874396,8.832367149758454,25.94565217391305,8.344100000000001,1.338910144927536,773,18,173,10,12,253,129,207,0.209,0.731,0.06,-0.9841,0,1,3,0,0,0,39.0,0,0,2,1,16,12,1,2,11,0,21,9,4,2,1,35,28,19,0,1,5,1,4,0,0,3,3,1,1,0,5,18,3,1,5,2,2,4,7,7,3,0,5,5,23,5,24,16,4,29,0,0,0,0,16,15,0,3,8,119,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892458031860712,0.15543208813039205,0.0,0.0,0.16049764711590764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09890479774721612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2428741488471845,0.0886594212418528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485114177142814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12528445506309824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11612272209808527,0.16092758686159073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28495341943516683,0.0,0.0,0.12149720737438392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09606234117739944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16366144477365646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344577662255219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16034910305275787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13028647674374566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949719357941704,0.0,0.1458890788162759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641850702607192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15145431379951688,0.23979154113461246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1457699880874848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12364865012170945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542898085165231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10691579437834944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15965043048024802,0.0,0.16396275914479866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420573187273325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1643068161796116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215951028038355,0.0,0.15204640477336953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662446976683628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12000397232096915,0.0,0.11544421479638013,0.11666391519303987,0.0,0.3923065010694139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10588270564373714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,comingupnext2,2020/03/11,"My husband decided he wants to go to rehab - I could use some advise on a few things from those who have gone and those who have supported their loved ones while they are there. The drinking has been going on for a couple of years now and has gotten progressively worse. We have talked about rehab here and there for the past year and he really started to express interest this past month. After some heart to hearts, bad nights, repercussions of actions, the physical affects getting worse and worse, and all that stress catching up to him, he decided he's ready and asked me to find somewhere and get him in. 

He was really sick from it yesterday but he had some beers in the evening. Last night was the worst I've ever seen him. I was up with him most of the night because he needed support. He was anxious, hyper ventilating, talking about all sorts of topics, overthinking, he said he felt pressure in his head and his eyes were killing him, etc. This morning I found him a facility that accepts our insurance and got him all setup. He's been in bed all day and is really hurting. He asked the counselor if he could go on Friday. 

Here's my current dilemma: The rehab called back and said they can't take him until Sunday morning but he could go to a detox center for a week and then get transferred there. I haven't mentioned this to him yet since he is resting but does anyone have any suggestions based on experience what would be better? Should we just wait and have him go on Sunday? Or should we get him to the detox on Friday and have him transferred the following week? I've seen him sick before but never like this and I am fearful of what could happen in the next 2-4 days. 

I'm open to all suggestions and/or advise on how I can best support him until he goes and during and after treatment. What is my role in this process? What worked for you and your spouse/loved one?

alcoholism,no-more-3mpties,2020/03/11,"Coming to terms Hello, first time poster, long time lurker on separate account. I recently went on a bender, and it woke me up that I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. It was a four day bender, and I know I drank about a fifth a day. The reason I've never posted and just joined the sub was a mental block, like it's finally admitting I can't or shouldn't drink. I've made progress, having finally admit it to close people in my life, and have been sober for a couple days now. The next issue however, is that I'm pretty sure I'm going through withdrawals now. I've had withdrawal once or twice before, and I waited it out, but this one has me scared, as does the idea of going to the doctor to make sure this isn't my end. I know it's for the best, but it's scary to admit these things and that I could be going to the doctor and it's just a mild withdrawal or that I've nearly killed myself. Any words of comfort that helped you seek treatment and walk into the hospital?",5.822362736273625,5.1468417673267375,6.5262736273627375,80.98006750675071,66.97029702970298,9.523672367236726,27.274527452745275,8.841846274778883,1.8147564356435644,775,18,160,11,11,256,119,202,0.092,0.7829999999999999,0.125,0.1655,1,0,2,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,3,5,7,1,1,16,0,14,6,0,3,3,37,31,14,1,2,7,0,0,1,0,1,4,0,0,0,17,13,3,2,7,1,1,6,4,2,0,4,8,0,14,5,21,20,2,31,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,3,17,105,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15085981386805333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959953607924604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12011891557183554,0.0,0.14814136577159126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121599019859554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11270679338022377,0.15619365404013716,0.0,0.27311446050783794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2889716612134079,0.12353228092410233,0.0,0.0,0.13828553786458794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12502810196057249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3092733023978121,0.0,0.12007277555866863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24067775597796684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946182680075933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15935531354804094,0.0,0.14733700571823685,0.0,0.0,0.15617542402559578,0.0,0.15515846909017544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09970726932331446,0.0689648815642218,0.0,0.0,0.12492439656382034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13357139866782047,0.09422708464815707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14225862804817904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10887324521582528,0.0,0.15012795167585566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150333486969685,0.09565538336701766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09786432399953696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13519468242256116,0.1436130414412683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14513859100743529,0.13938096799836447,0.15155572818065524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413283181247222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2660880271024721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09378211217168893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16462601240903135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13085907917933126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,DrummerBound,2020/03/11,"So I am well on the way of becoming an alcoholic. If I not already am, that is.

I need tips on how to get off of it before I start feeling the physical dependence/withdrawals, as I don't really feel any real problems with it yet. I know they're right around the corner.

I just get so bored when I'm sober, the days are getting *long* whenever I don't drink.

I am (self diagnosed) depressed, alcohol numbs that and let's me enjoy everyday things. It even helps me get put of bed in the morning. I need ways to distract myself, I guess.

The last thing I wanna do is work work work.
Maybe you have any tips on hobbies? Beginner level is what I need.

Something that can keep me busy hours on end, most days of the week.


General tips are VERY welcome as well.

alcoholism,Anikdote,2020/03/11,"Struggling Hard to know where to start with something like this.

Almost 5 years ago I nearly drank myself to death. Spent a week in the hospital after a serious bout of pancreatitis. Following that I cut back for a while, but slowly but surely it was right back to the same old behavior. I wasn't pouring vodka down my throat but I was still getting smashed most days.

Two DUIs later it's become obvious to me that this isn't something I can tackle alone. I'm terrified about attending meetings, I'm a bit of an introvert and I get very anxious around new people.

I'm also anxious because I'm not religious and there just aren't any secular programs in my area.

Yesterday I had to get the breath lock installed on my truck and I'm utterly humiliated. I know my girls are going to see and hear it and ask me what it is and that breaks my fucking heart.

alcoholism,anonymous099213,2020/03/11,"Went over the top after starting uni Hi, im 19 and have had bad anxiety as long as I can remember. Before I started uni in september I was very anti alcohol, which is how my parents raised me. I hadn't drank at all before I started 

Social pressures (*everyone* drinks loads) and never having tried it before led me to start, which really was around the beginning of November. I was bullied at school, and doing this with lots of people was the first time I felt I fitted in. I was definitely drinking too much, all of it socially. I also want to be clear Im not addicted to alcohol in any way, I just had poor self control and no concept of the consequences. I had days / weeks off here and there, and when I came back after Christmas I had a week where I went out 3 nights (not in a row). I had my worst hangover which passed after a day or two. 

However, as I'm predisposed to anxiety it started me thinking what I'd been doing the past few months. I decided I'd either cut down or stop altogether. Two weeks into that I went on a pre planned night out and was careful about what I drank, and following more consideration decided after I was going to stop altogether. 

Im having really bad anxiety about what I've done to my body. I keep prodding and poking things, constantly check my skin / eyes for yellow, I over analyse everything my body does. The only genuine symptom I've had is an on / off sharp (but not bad) pain on my right side. It's been 1 ½ weeks since I last drank at all, and 3 ½ since I was drinking too much. The pain went away a couple days ago, came back yesterday and is better but still there today. I know the best advice would be a doctor, but I'm terrified my parents will find out as I know they would be just as angry and dissapointed as I feel right now.",4.29877669452182,5.0035916016713085,5.823694289693595,79.95201311513466,70.30919220055709,9.325951717734448,28.32880687093779,9.516144504307137,2.4176489322191275,1391,48,281,30,24,474,187,359,0.10400000000000001,0.84,0.055999999999999994,-0.9259,3,0,5,0,0,0,42.0,0,0,1,6,18,11,1,1,15,0,33,17,4,3,5,56,60,26,0,3,11,2,4,0,0,3,7,0,0,1,13,20,8,4,10,3,2,10,6,8,0,3,28,6,38,3,45,26,11,75,0,0,2,0,7,27,0,3,37,195,51,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08449653264112122,0.0,0.07574115041934545,0.06870728108414559,0.1656676506881634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061984126077715085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052708953735549104,0.0,0.1778831119691297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06899967304729474,0.0,0.0,0.07282249987835042,0.11919967096367108,0.1941509800343449,0.0,0.0,0.19786401065761136,0.0,0.0813411849313987,0.06855064048496443,0.0,0.17219062612666933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17729988621145026,0.07902585483673491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375997284912576,0.08693322423594622,0.0,0.08576252036165656,0.0,0.14996117879633755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07933401049823745,0.06782887450313921,0.07931888216023716,0.0,0.2277886959566249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406341815305739,0.06966032377980533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039191010027282605,0.0,0.0744210433052229,0.0,0.07084205813734863,0.06592933574679494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04405029784875048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511698997440231,0.0,0.0,0.06889379035522591,0.0,0.0,0.08519412293927242,0.06318039076014471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06859325476321315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06589559988167235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061867150711718215,0.0,0.11395644676188668,0.0,0.05977991850592373,0.0,0.0,0.1454743770996707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05894928384592477,0.16495063186201825,0.0,0.17212971808655989,0.0,0.07399135766359716,0.05373516056890036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09930883156005747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08780288043655825,0.13238496663634675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844350769796597,0.0,0.0,0.08085906083309156,0.0,0.0,0.12823291930076255,0.0,0.0,0.15802185628869292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743072607806024,0.0,0.06189899401939929,0.1296024216042058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08056179742267615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051493707309112714,0.04966480320705752,0.0,0.0,0.045196271987016125,0.0,0.0734697142077308,0.0,0.0,0.05262369872988918,0.0,0.15143056618063225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395325574917439,0.0457169689021541,0.06152324169643698,0.2486930077642688,0.0,0.0,0.28740743691779164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11012070688235344,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,EndeavorWithin,2020/03/11,"Scare of my life second time around. I fell off the wagon around the holiday season and it didn't get bad till last month. I was drinking everyday and switched to the hard stuff (not good). So my last drink was yesterday morning when I got home from work, I had one beer left and I drank it and thought I would be able to sleep. I couldn't so I ended up staying awake.

At around 5 pm last night I just had a feeling something was wrong. A tightness in my throat and chest and all I could think about was here we go. By the time 9 pm came around I was pacing around my house like a lunatic just trying to control my breathing and i was forced to call out of work (i work nights). So I muscled through the first night but knew if I was already this bad it was going to get much worse. Swallowed my pride and went to the hospital.

When I woke up in the hospital I met a man who told me this time I was lucky and next time it might kill me and that I needed to get help. Thankfully they didn't keep me overnight and I was able to get some sleep. Each time you withdrawl it gets worse and I don't think I can survive a third time, not with the way my chest felt. So I have to start today, I am an alcoholic and I can't let it kill me. thank you for reading.",1.2872305764411038,2.9712288947368464,2.218214285714289,98.89970238095242,79.6015037593985,5.485964912280703,20.8577694235589,6.21433560688645,-0.13382155388471206,970,26,235,7,24,304,144,266,0.114,0.782,0.10300000000000001,-0.7184,1,0,5,0,0,2,22.0,1,2,1,7,15,12,2,1,14,0,25,13,6,1,1,46,50,22,2,5,6,0,4,1,0,2,2,0,1,1,11,23,6,3,6,5,0,5,7,6,0,4,24,4,40,6,30,20,4,44,0,0,0,0,10,13,0,4,25,154,51,4,0.18135674898418125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09690760527741683,0.0,0.0,0.10006584111264548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4036148911488004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15142531012532556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09259275880648142,0.10371190342435237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10170350753156608,0.0723993034654474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17766057076906686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08031412503250843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045849710723501434,0.0,0.08706545978045145,0.0,0.0,0.0771309790199032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2368785403011485,0.0,0.1030692198156306,0.07605671831762767,0.07252377970848099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08123001249701095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06077980300394897,0.0,0.09095780307830292,0.0,0.0,0.10463066945226483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08059910566820573,0.20064437251318387,0.0,0.0,0.22174493367742948,0.0,0.0,0.0985223192069994,0.09272478156599878,0.06404881758189017,0.044300873435219545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0961954255514108,0.0,0.0,0.07237861339743143,0.0,0.06665903883917934,0.06723686570437402,0.0,0.0,0.09643747999606797,0.2552865352178297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06144601333061785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09070291334803547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090784871836913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18148772265937585,0.0,0.0,0.06980864282856304,0.0,0.0,0.06418262018453387,0.09665108206693214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038050441824216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16696892841697086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116206081884494,0.0,0.07198850047399936,0.3172517362950542,0.0,0.08595249627447142,0.08664707276356105,0.0,0.06156466399530058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07197627294091162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08405976162192717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19804480981340947,0.0,0.1848180209554044,0.06441531554951714,0.09914256757739437,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,BloodSample,2020/03/11,"How can I be sure my dad actually wants to be sober? I've known about his alcoholism for 11 years. He's been to rehab numerous times, but it just feels like  he doesn't want to change. He's kind of getting better, in that he doesn't drink as often as he used to. However,  his ""benders"" are still just as bad and last more than a week. It always just feels like a giant breach of trust, because as a family we've tried telling him time and time again that he can open up to us when he feels like drinking, because we feel like it'd be a healthy way to deal with his cravings, but he has never done that. He never opens up to us on the bad days and only brags about how well he's been doing on the good days. Why can't my dad just open up and be honest about his emotions and cravings? Is this behavior normal for an alcoholic?",5.642011494252879,4.3972343505747125,6.05574712643678,86.08063218390804,67.56321839080461,9.342528735632184,28.528735632183906,8.167268648758528,1.5472459770114937,643,16,148,7,9,208,101,174,0.055999999999999994,0.7490000000000001,0.195,0.9802,1,0,4,0,0,0,17.0,3,0,0,1,14,13,0,0,7,0,17,5,0,3,3,31,25,14,0,3,6,2,4,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,7,10,4,0,5,2,0,0,5,2,1,0,3,4,11,11,26,17,1,24,0,0,0,0,22,10,0,1,17,88,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.12401248071623065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.271621348785428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10574136451210464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21221423673998047,0.1549344917765324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11239259657082436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13443458355682267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1639131416862431,0.13101467350670132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13004772909510065,0.0,0.2489815103785693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14294873953459905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11980042152631508,0.0,0.2570233828911127,0.36314605374814574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06639444698971969,0.0,0.0,0.10658930408241986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13233504576958835,0.0,0.1035877727714227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2483409420839549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960250178886868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12451215353812238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966506371138463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014868513808872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11977210325945573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1110741771106651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2223054224441324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08627948768341996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057249912452884,0.10975696610123543,0.0,0.0,0.14991103820212234,0.10087078450030837,0.1019365125325308,0.0,0.11426085634301147,0.0,0.11467061103836328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818358367148852
alcoholism,dreaice,2020/03/12,"My boyfriend is an alcoholic and is blaming me for the cause of his drinking/smoking. My boyfriend of 6 years (M-28) knows he has a problem, and can most likely assume he gets it hereditarily, but won’t stop drinking/smoking etc. I know on my part (F-26) I can’t do anything to change the situation and he needs to seek help on his own time, but I think lately since his mom brought it to my attention about the addiction, it’s all I notice and it worries me. If we ever get in an argument, he blames me for the reason why he does it but he was already turning to alcohol as the first drink of his day before he even saw me. Then he feels bad and takes it back and it’ll happen again. There’s a lot more going on and I want to be there for him but it’s taking a lot of energy out of me constantly worrying and feeling this way. Does anyone have any advise on how to get through this or what helped them? I’d greatly appreciate it because I do love him very much but not when he treats me this way and I know I can’t do anything to help but I’d like to try.",2.505333508403361,3.609434013392861,4.0881092436974775,89.22159663865547,74.9375,7.234873949579833,25.676470588235286,7.724431198458867,1.169713025210084,825,28,187,11,17,276,129,224,0.106,0.784,0.11,0.2238,0,0,5,0,0,0,21.0,1,0,1,1,9,7,0,0,10,0,14,5,0,3,2,40,33,21,0,4,9,1,2,2,0,2,3,0,0,0,13,11,3,1,9,1,0,2,4,2,0,1,3,3,26,5,25,27,9,22,0,0,1,1,23,6,0,6,14,124,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345703846021623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2638446664306461,0.0,0.0,0.1362217051689988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08394503247010755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08631376279011467,0.0,0.20316507567333988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09491954914979554,0.10306920784184358,0.07524931211072379,0.0,0.1050403497076476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268092994030217,0.13058564068656006,0.0,0.0,0.13339732895842007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961010499577896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2160504684325263,0.0,0.0,0.12092651009756775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1376708531421369,0.08153250937231023,0.11166067471372017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12483232453379965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050000016650808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934806022852973,0.0,0.07015513344817761,0.0,0.0,0.13609562901811054,0.0,0.0,0.10915966431794102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2482224197480153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20352206531021144,0.0,0.13924834997815394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206153958777645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20989254688899106,0.111411542312621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14457419089076676,0.0,0.0,0.09074433227796078,0.0915309399753934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1405399360755694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13367603799230185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11811765973894554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269192972890179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021127893037569,0.1387543758310252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10320333376710578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1856265724297943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909687486409206,0.0,0.0,0.07198022822674714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08380925413054369,0.13426983175862736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10185286843993564,0.07280949757000983,0.1959655867117118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113875225717842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507234012539725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794928275581484
alcoholism,anonreddy,2020/03/12,"I'm 21 and I am deathly scared of becoming an alcoholic. I created this account only to vent my fears of it. Ill try to make this short, basically I love to drink like most my age. My grandmother is currently and has always been an alcoholic, my grandfather was once one, my uncle is one depending on the phase he's going through. My father chooses to drink in moderation out of fear and he definitely has control, but, has also shown he could become like them if he was on the wrong path. Then there is me. I have always been fine with or without alcohol. Ever since turning 21 I kind of went a little wild. I now psych myself out. If I am not entertained, I want to drink cause why not. I am fine going without it like I said, if I am busy. It holds me back from accomplishing fitness goals or smaller things I want to do in the day because I am lazy the next day or feel like crap. I don't always drink to get drunk but 75% the time I am. I find the excuse to get drunk 3-4 nights a week. If I didn't have this family history I wouldn't be worried but still, I shouldn't drink like this. The fact that I even have these scared thoughts makes it feel like a problem. I care so much about health and fitness and day time-im fine because I am busy! but night comes around and me and my boyfriend get bored, so why not sometimes? Then on top of all this I have about 4 friends I consistently hangout with and 3/4 I only drink when I hangout with. Basically I just want advice on what everyone thinks! Like I said I psych myself out- I will be thinking ""i actually don't want to drink that's not fun and doesn't make me feel good"" then the other half of my brain is like ""just do it you'll feel great its fun"". I also am becoming more socially awkward because I feel the need to drink to hangout with people.  I get super excited to drink too, it's ridiculous. I see someone else who drank 3 times in one week (which they probably never do) and so i feel like i can too.  I'm scared I am headed down a dangerous path. Thanks for any help/opinions/anything.",2.0208988623577966,3.888803627078389,3.473782347793473,89.89010595074386,78.04988123515442,6.806875859482436,23.668021002625327,7.7627490962704995,1.056259857482185,1601,53,348,25,38,526,201,421,0.13,0.6890000000000001,0.18100000000000002,0.9783,1,0,12,0,0,0,49.0,0,1,2,5,19,36,3,6,15,0,39,21,3,6,4,70,74,30,1,13,19,1,6,9,1,4,5,2,0,0,20,19,15,2,11,15,1,4,13,12,0,4,10,9,55,24,41,57,4,42,0,0,1,1,15,17,1,9,30,222,75,4,0.0,0.0,0.06206410867540765,0.0,0.0,0.062148866574171235,0.0,0.20390613282087086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10172127463056334,0.1587600740021217,0.0,0.0,0.043249960092210535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052337113682884406,0.05661719488198419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048904224489532966,0.0,0.11630931515503395,0.2107225336052808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099827124857222,0.0,0.0,0.06484410760816255,0.06533438581317925,0.0,0.054785488723228894,0.0,0.0,0.07133244377711978,0.0507791655302425,0.0,0.0,0.12304958718898162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5607312218153294,0.0,0.0,0.05312936773489372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04200698567632207,0.05752954740898336,0.0,0.06077221520054639,0.0,0.0,0.059956113594587086,0.1431346328250976,0.1929474405609623,0.13630686210795565,0.0,0.0,0.05812895096841876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0491369513282635,0.0,0.13291282134231966,0.0,0.07229032219334369,0.05334439012912645,0.0,0.07011886648389345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06527161530784642,0.06760348073025592,0.0,0.0,0.04262952169292645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06869856302337618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06622927478567754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2796442990280212,0.06374358282941009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05740119000547586,0.0,0.12735983125628975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04675307917730165,0.047158353325409234,0.04905199034434723,0.0,0.067638976145356,0.119367973714047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06773157846678356,0.12929035775508685,0.09674083786949134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044092006868769136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06857120680522841,0.06085629988544995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209957106736483,0.0,0.19102310991908528,0.0,0.05068070689233842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05261030858335114,0.0,0.0,0.0648318596160406,0.053887798446113584,0.0,0.06290170505652415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05079078280549194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05855403607949738,0.0,0.0,0.04225279821134156,0.08150420770898463,0.0,0.050491037991653484,0.11125644627072827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04318000469884506,0.06917818355977601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15005094508043332,0.0,0.1020316464161018,0.0,0.0,0.05895753612974609,0.1147776292233935,0.0,0.0,0.1226156347524341,0.0,0.0,0.0645885574127273,0.0,0.0,0.06953626083583002,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,jhbball2002,2020/03/12,"CBD or Medical MJ for alcoholics - looking for real world experiences I have a family member who's a deep alcoholic.   Not a drinks too much on the weekend type, but a does anything to sneak a drink type.

This has been going on and off for more than 12 years.   Through rehab 6-8 times.  Recently had a pretty terrible bender, that caused all sorts of problems for our family.  

I was curious about CBD, or medical marijuana I guess, as a means to mitigate the effects.  Sobriety just hasn't worked, and it may never work.   Looking for real-world experiences, or any general advice.

Thanks.",3.4965909090909086,6.1750434907407445,5.283535353535356,74.66954545454547,77.05555555555556,9.482828282828283,28.33670033670034,9.800150414767053,3.4942851851851864,459,20,78,15,11,156,81,108,0.071,0.826,0.10300000000000001,0.5267,0,0,4,0,0,0,18.0,1,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,9,0,7,7,0,2,2,19,13,7,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,4,2,4,0,2,3,0,1,3,2,0,0,3,2,4,1,15,9,3,11,0,0,2,0,2,5,0,6,5,52,8,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15029504044373315,0.0,0.32873842188217123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10459168219087203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265672095289095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1579986039880436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13459451540226958,0.0,0.0,0.30133783358961586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30089875183541803,0.2899845810315227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08741009689028248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16943194063963046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583124764586046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16753714546272755,0.0,0.3098817736907547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11306329967314148,0.0,0.11862277269129078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15647349481152653,0.0,0.14716921734403526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3501242036213403,0.0,0.0,0.15186244197632126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14160163661567504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968408175193987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2239416196270645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09904443791091903
alcoholism,ThisFlipFlopHere,2020/03/12,"Starting Day 1 today... I'm not sure if I'm an alcoholic but I'm going to assume I am for the better of my body and mental health and the people I care about around me. I can't just have a beer or just two. I have to drink every single one until they're gone. 

I don't crave alcohol but when it's around moderate is not a word in my vocabulary. I'm usually a happy drunk until I'm not. I'm already super emotional when I'm sober and with drama currently existing in my life and who knows when that will give up there is just better ways to get the emotions out than thru alcohol. 

I'm just gonna play it safe and learn to say no thank you and keep the healthy side getting healthier. I have been perusing this sub for a while and on a fence about maybe this is a major change i need to make to be a better person, mom, daughter, sister. Soo here's to day 1. Soo looking forward to the fresh feeling days ahead.",3.3420023790642333,3.826511067010312,5.010412371134018,85.72003568596351,72.35051546391753,8.237272006344172,25.23235527359239,8.384062270229773,1.4080766058683591,713,20,157,11,13,243,121,194,0.057,0.738,0.204,0.9844,1,0,5,0,0,0,16.0,0,1,0,5,13,10,0,0,13,0,12,9,1,1,1,33,35,17,0,2,11,3,1,0,0,2,5,1,0,1,6,11,6,3,4,5,0,3,6,0,0,2,2,3,12,10,26,30,2,26,0,0,1,0,8,9,0,3,15,97,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4308147269686657,0.0,0.0,0.14828501813462408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392426457937037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35652857201007143,0.0,0.14925918905145433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13700321872750434,0.0,0.14214984369271333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2599802839427012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13163533462254362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3023052616862498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11321586585225425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06794351709339203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14040970726351182,0.1289037570249337,0.07636782422224064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14304359052904986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14283324728894867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194377593067973,0.0,0.0,0.07384842013706007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09491230944574154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11284029247424075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08969566890149261,0.0,0.1349967146999145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13541735741305908,0.0,0.0,0.15737717048424404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963659665904147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910552802007036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09315799205194393,0.1173301682065385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068595749105716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951105881104574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12664587717402934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12371349854721025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12737081232773992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312638441136549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14799394456109086,0.0,0.0,0.10665980338176533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,jeffaziza99,2020/03/12,"20 years old Hi, new to Reddit and talking so don’t know if I’m posting in the right category here but felt like I needed to just tell someone about the hole I’m in.

I’ve had quite a hard couple of years, started taking drugs at 17 and finally quit about half a year ago. Started to take care of myself, training, taking antidepressants and went into que for getting a psychologist. I got the psychologist, keep taking my medication and still train. Then about two months ago I started drinking, I drink every night before bed. Can’t handle my mind, I’ve been very emotional unstable since about 11. Lots of problems in school with learning, my parents getting divorced, a dad for alcoholic, no friends and being asocial. I do have some friends now but life is complicated so we don’t really see each other that much anymore. I work in a social environment but have lots of problems with my thoughts, specially when it comes to how people look at me. They don’t really even have to say anything, just a look can make me question my hole personality and who I am.

alcoholism,Areyo718,2020/03/12,"What does it feel like when you crave alcohol? (Delete if not allowed) My dad is an alcoholic and he’s currently unemployed. It seems like he’s given up and he constantly drinks although everyone in my family is quite transparent about how it makes us feel. I try to never get angry with him becuase I know it’s an addiction. I don’t smoke or drink. I don’t drink coffee. None of it. So I don’t fully understand the sensation/feeling of craving a substance. I want to better understand what goes on in his mind when he decides to have another drink. It breaks my heart to think that he knows what it’s doing to us but his body craves it. He’s so smart and intelligent. He was an engineer, he built our house with his own hands, rebuilt car engines. He’s the best dad ever but I feel like I’ve lost him over the past few years and it breaks my heart so much.

alcoholism,vlnsux,2020/03/13,"""Kindling"" and how it would apply to me? I didn't even know what this term was for a long time and I still only have a vague understanding, but from what I've read I'm terrified of it.

I'm mostly a binge drinker. When I'm being disciplined I'll only binge 1-2x a week. When I'm being lazy it can creep up to as much as 5x a week. But then I'll often take a few days off of drinking to recover. I don't experience bad withdrawal symptoms, however I once went to the doctor at about 3-4 days sober and my heart was RACING. She attributed it to PAWS. The most withdrawal I get is a fast heart beat, a bit sweaty, and trouble falling asleep.

I guess my question is, am I at risk for this kindling effect? I often go a couple days on, couple days off, in terms of my drinking. I've been trying to go longer periods sober, but it's hard. But I've heard it's actually worse to be doing this, as opposed to drinking every day (maybe not bingeing though) *because* of this kindling phenomenon. Is that true? Is on and off sober worse than just being a drunk or completely abstinent? The concept makes me extremely nervous. Thanks for reading.",2.1694513457556965,4.122392760869566,3.9188198757764,86.4739855072464,77.91304347826087,6.989648033126294,24.865424430641824,7.957251820313856,1.4351511387163551,885,32,182,15,21,297,133,230,0.162,0.787,0.051,-0.9705,1,0,4,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,0,2,10,6,0,2,13,0,18,9,3,4,1,28,33,18,0,1,7,0,1,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,13,5,4,2,4,6,0,4,3,4,0,0,6,2,14,2,30,22,7,30,0,0,0,0,3,9,0,7,17,113,27,3,0.0,0.0,0.1197111444292377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10242682429057864,0.07478031733181655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339271352701568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12862029819189735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714706648067385,0.0,0.3955696568789752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12556100544224544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3605184902801202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08102435427913736,0.0,0.10335728662786456,0.0,0.0,0.11999772530677638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0640915751945397,0.0,0.1394357767414865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13513813099623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10989090542745833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29073617240547034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741786824367696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10856173765243443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08188517475128261,0.0,0.12324150886473395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09017876407726858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13064273289838102,0.0,0.18659667659078133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13742182610648532,0.0,0.2454123781672615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796680989815816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12750420936869752,0.092234823164179,0.0,0.0,0.11294080942477125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12052559182447335,0.0,0.07153160816264313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08328690912154879,0.0,0.0,0.12770691099844236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968017493709806,0.0,0.0,0.11371909261973588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2500285182505383,0.08714337387787979,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ObviousDust,2020/03/13,"How to help my mother struggling with alcoholism? Can I help? Alcoholism runs in my family. My grandmother was an alcoholic and successfully recovered, but now I see that my mother is suffering. I have known for a while that she has been drinking a lot to excess but last night (I am home for Spring Break) I came home to her on the floor, helped her up, she spilled her drink, helped her into bed and then a few minutes later heard her fall out of bed. Helped her in again and told her not to try to get up again. 

This morning, she remembers none of it. She says she went to bed at midnight (even though I didn't get home till 1:45 am) and was even puzzled by the spilled drink on the floor, she thinks the dog peed or something. 

I haven't said anything to my mom yet, I was just so shocked that she couldn't remember anything. I am flying back tomorrow, even though my school is shut down due to COVID-19, there are still responsibilities I have back in that town. Should I bring this up to her? How do I help her? Can I even help her? Is it helpful to tell her what I saw last night??? It's not the first time I have found her in a similar state but this was by far the worst/seemed different and also the first time she didn't remember. 

Any advice welcome as long as it's intended to help.",2.434257871064471,4.300277869731803,3.1222422122272206,92.88937031484258,76.816091954023,6.991237714476098,22.84207896051974,7.893859768569023,0.8678737631184408,1008,30,226,16,23,316,135,261,0.046,0.858,0.096,0.9189,1,0,7,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,0,3,19,5,0,1,12,0,24,6,0,3,0,29,36,20,0,2,7,3,0,0,0,1,3,3,6,0,12,9,6,0,6,3,0,5,7,3,0,2,14,5,41,2,34,20,3,48,0,1,2,0,38,18,0,3,23,160,53,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827721944095453,0.0,0.28963145145860564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07224324253491493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0614329179006996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486809051932185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13892864648464506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10332257217700523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09438395193022524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2654904578000153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386695106129483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851625989075689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15368286346571391,0.0,0.09905092205764468,0.0,0.0,0.0943957222626855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5449647376903308,0.0,0.27184905097633355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14727500674650434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07994626130414398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680211217734494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10580273946186453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16955213169014316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30700593142296223,0.0,0.08593209732799001,0.07184038020559479,0.0,0.09142684926796217,0.07198766655572457,0.08224029567331745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06954658336296006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07214402009966281,0.0,0.0,0.0944408614576219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07895936820377564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05788492394065128,0.17751319509429153,0.0,0.1053535943940939,0.0,0.0,0.08632180235771397,0.0,0.061333552168842974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0837442039013244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,breathing_dead,2020/03/13,"Not sure how I (20F) should leave alcoholic BF (30M) who has a violent history. Been together 18 months, living together 14. Worried about welfare of pets. TLDR;      Not sure about best way to leave alcoholic BF, worried about our shared pets welfare, advice from others who have been in his position? 

How to break up with alcoholic bf with violent history? 

I’ve decided I’m leaving my emotionally manipulative bf. He’s ten years my senior and we’ve been together 18 months or so. He is all I could ask for when sober (or if he’s just had a few) but when he’s drunk his personality changes. 

When we got together he was living with his dad with no job, no license and no way to function as an adult, having just been released after a four year jail stint. I got him a job soon after and have driven him to work every day since. I got him his permit, but he failed his test, so I’m still driving. He has another booked, but has not made any effort to book lessons or drive with his dad. 

I have been unemployed myself for much of the time, living on benefits while studying. I’ve worked a few temp jobs but otherwise he’s provided for me (except for when we first got together). He is a good provider. 

The underlying issue is his drinking. His family are multigenerational alcoholics. His father frequently drives drunk, and he’s been in trouble years before for driving without a license and drunk driving / drug driving. We have three cats, two of which are his (we have adopted them since we got together). He has thrown things and accused me of cheating when drunk, he’s threatened to kill me and my family, he’s gotten me fired because of his behaviour at work functions. He’s damaged relationships between my family, friends and myself, and I’m constantly apologising on his behalf. 

I have gotten a house with a friend, and can move in shortly. But I’m not sure how to go about leaving. 

I am worried he’ll immediately turn back to drugs, smash the house up and hurt the two cats I can’t legally take with me (this is my biggest fear, other than him hurting me). He is extremely dangerous and can and will hurt people if he’s angry enough. 

I don’t know if I should take my cat and go, or if I should just take them all regardless and leave. I’m still responsible for taking him to and from work, so leaving during the day is tricky. I also don’t know wether trying to talk it out with him will end in me getting hurt. I don’t want to leave my pets to be abandoned by him if he returns to jail or drug use (meth), but on the off chance he keeps himself together and finds a way to work, he deserves to have his cats as company. 

My real estate agent is letting me break lease early under the DV act and is very supportive so I don’t have to worry about that, thankfully. 

I know it’s long, but what would you guys do in this situation? Any advice would be so helpful. 

Thank you all.",4.6293894993895,5.621275439153443,5.5635978835978825,81.06893772893773,69.74074074074075,8.919441052774387,29.353276353276357,9.197007762596977,2.3951958485958484,2262,84,448,44,39,744,251,567,0.19,0.741,0.068,-0.9973,5,0,9,0,0,1,73.0,6,2,2,11,26,26,5,1,18,0,51,12,0,7,6,88,84,52,1,13,26,3,1,0,6,8,7,0,3,3,12,32,9,2,6,7,0,11,13,14,0,6,17,1,64,12,66,55,8,61,0,7,0,0,70,17,0,10,28,289,76,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181342498693934,0.0,0.2583935355261271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04833863888691682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08221069625263114,0.0633828942054622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056508843989937836,0.0,0.0,0.04647923762712992,0.0,0.03684731638740544,0.0,0.051435088116504164,0.0,0.06343434059396105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06394384590452623,0.0,0.0,0.06532064476726586,0.0,0.04826120699843953,0.0,0.0,0.07796533002448515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05921406126123058,0.21029448517858396,0.0,0.0,0.06799360649027547,0.05353720861337144,0.06245686916081197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05092835624676215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17094930837059602,0.06801854728494476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055246542671486126,0.05141533089815399,0.0,0.0,0.09340084873640687,0.0,0.03158053660673097,0.0,0.06870570177603677,0.05069923121706312,0.24172091286006964,0.0,0.0,0.059851036528212165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04051567506444147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13949312093122504,0.25883474338155793,0.0,0.0,0.06308991249098722,0.179949963707522,0.053727176041117465,0.06687453560621724,0.0,0.09965861111486274,0.0,0.0,0.4480250532655547,0.0,0.06181012334155201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16012475813139826,0.05349280181703376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05719546024552132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964948300946166,0.06424452469761005,0.04443475997348498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04190564079283567,0.05277910971164595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880077352154974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06489637536621855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10000310033770513,0.06794382889320967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654449642851087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06859339671401486,0.17090889959680222,0.0,0.1817914570213198,0.048584199643859016,0.0,0.11130109864226533,0.0,0.0,0.040157631962785684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03524654470204289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04103886157253678,0.0657478830479405,0.11809390433075174,0.0,0.0,0.0522059305101297,0.0,0.04987427476876893,0.035652612864056306,0.14393764750935728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05826778038039983,0.0,0.22002701462298474,0.2455433606658831,0.0,0.08587819851302035,0.0,0.0,0.11677571337481225
alcoholism,DamnitChubz,2020/03/13,"Today Marks the Day I Broke My Promise After Two Years. I drowned myself after having my whole world crash around me. Am I being dramatic? Yes, I can confidently say I am. Am I afraid to go to my meeting before work tomorrow? I've never been more terrified. I put myself in a very explosive situation that ended very badly for me and now I'm stuck with nothing but this pack of Newports and a sixer of Stellas. I wanted to try apologising to a group of anonymous users. I'm now realizing I have lost my outlet to apologise to myself and that's really why I've come to this sub. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to figure out what the correct path is for me. The path I'm supposed to be on to excel. It's always what seems more comfortable to me rather than what's more important to the improvement of my future lifestyle. It's always, ""how can I feel better now?"" This mindset is the main factor as to how I've ruined every relationship I've worked so hard to build. I bounce from town to town, state to state, just to burn every bridge built for my path to excellence. Tomorrow, at noon, I'll be starting over with the big hug, white chip, walking in just like countless members I've seen over the past two years. Will I be Okay? Yes. That's my simple answer. I'll be okay. I lost my focus this evening, but hopefully you all can forgive my slip up as I take this mistake to the soul. My biggest supporter once said, ""you'll burn bridges in your life, yeah, but always remember that your only path is forward now."" I'm just as terrified to tell him about my relapse.

All of this over a girl. I hope she throws away the chips she holds for me. I know I definitely don't deserve them.",2.9111779448621564,4.539777532163747,4.389360902255639,85.34802631578948,74.84795321637426,7.341854636591477,24.78738512949039,8.07648339933343,1.4045385129490398,1324,43,270,21,28,441,182,342,0.08,0.708,0.213,0.9944,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,0,4,1,7,15,20,0,1,13,5,21,2,0,3,4,37,42,13,1,5,7,0,3,1,0,2,1,2,0,1,15,8,0,1,9,0,0,6,4,7,0,2,6,7,46,13,51,29,7,43,1,4,2,1,16,18,0,4,20,175,61,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3181316286639342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11345245667968308,0.0,0.0,0.11973812552838906,0.0,0.1064106764514016,0.0,0.0,0.10844572206506094,0.0,0.0,0.1127141365532873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1097819893585933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08219103748198964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11287783219645953,0.0,0.0,0.08417576555357552,0.0,0.21475465753093967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06443967298664803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0724295389774813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22833014033938825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2531619140774814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07004006044714406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09001768593586633,0.06226285296332663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27824104083394324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098292909445521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12228625373313172,0.0,0.0,0.1357240320342062,0.0,0.09692714148433687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1216600156097307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281167330529618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08164408911586214,0.0,0.0,0.1368274954648436,0.1443695607405574,0.0,0.1212287243499379,0.1013488314604656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23204102878076915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14325274543128094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09020573937880123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14462229400088555,0.0,0.0,0.09582226133880507,0.0,0.11139194527378198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12080230529075063,0.0,0.0,0.17305264320267738,0.0,0.24898914720671486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.210309807480816,0.07516995667998183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499866811140234,0.1422870220916614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855619527320529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641399158995591

alcoholism,krookedkat,2020/03/13,"Got out of detox two days ago, how long will I feel this way? After 6 years of daily drinking and dependency I finally got the courage to go to detox for the first time after accepting I needed help. It was miserable and I spent three days there but probably should have stayed longer. I have extreme social anxiety (why I drank) so I didn't go to any of the groups and basically slept the whole time, they gave me Librium and a lot of hydroxyzine. I left with a rx for the hydroxyzine and trazodone but its not doing much for me in terms of the insomnia and anxiety. I'm still shaking and can't think straight, but my vitals looked fine after my follow up visit yesterday. I feel nothing, I feel like I don't exist, and I have no one to talk to. My brain feels so broken. I know its only been five days, but is it the drugs they prescribed me or is my brain gonna take a while to feel like a brain again?

 Its been two days since I got out, and now this whole coronavirus thing makes me feel like I have the worst luck in the world and I want to just stay inside and drink like everyone else so badly. I'm trying so hard not to give up after only five days of sobriety. Someone please give me some advice.",4.863292682926829,4.982326060975613,5.484048780487806,84.95485365853659,68.87804878048779,9.161626016260163,26.562601626016264,9.029198982220553,1.7319986991869922,945,25,204,16,15,306,136,246,0.16699999999999998,0.7659999999999999,0.067,-0.9816,0,0,3,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,2,1,10,13,0,2,13,0,15,12,4,3,0,40,43,22,0,3,8,0,7,4,0,3,5,0,0,0,8,14,3,0,9,2,1,5,6,4,0,7,11,8,27,9,28,29,7,39,0,1,1,0,10,9,0,5,26,134,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09822188481277386,0.08910029239167906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06835350075554968,0.0,0.1537870711604348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392564716202956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33662322765745445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3241186054646001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19693244629486514,0.1165652395350134,0.0,0.08396720528449675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09604618475417097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3049397732632921,0.21542334795728016,0.0,0.11010903409605474,0.0,0.08549782496900643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19284588199900893,0.11424973762118205,0.0,0.24117256784747101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09004150445059869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737294177922186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05524029727391898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10920960825516028,0.0,0.0,0.19642578746270714,0.0,0.0,0.0889524219131051,0.08440710429802263,0.0,0.0,0.08545407596018119,0.0,0.0,0.06709439965141432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07388993252378802,0.07453043963014871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09644664732735146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.068111419815231,0.15289204707487652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103350501595118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837193898392272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08314686903374653,0.0,0.0,0.10246216541704617,0.08516585134294101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21427077427582766,0.08027123732526686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07557460927392137,0.0807899769358299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06677755698052505,0.06440581576652057,0.0,0.0,0.11722195917271518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06824294120767803,0.0,0.19637667960121444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059286224577196615,0.07978395793777675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069895959573868,0.22444233623971835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06472822618171672
alcoholism,secondtothedrink,2020/03/13,"Fiancé (M32) is triggered by caffeine, anyone else? That’s my question really. Lots of things trigger his benders and have done since he was 15 but by far the biggest enemy is caffeine. If he drinks coffee, an energy drink or God FORBID any type of pre-workout for the gym, we are then drunk and on a bender for at least a week. The initial caffeine might have been for something innocent or positive (at an AA meeting for example) but then the second the caffeine hits him, all he can think about is drink and his drink of choice is a highly caffeinated wine. What came first, the alcohol addiction or the caffeine addiction? I guess he loves the “high” from the caffeine and talks about being able to feel his emotions better (he has horrific mental health issues) and that everything is clearer. I think he believes the caffeine makes him almost super human. Does anything else feel that way? Can the high from caffeine be a starting point for you too?",7.655113636363637,7.841549738636368,7.096727272727275,75.53009090909092,62.97727272727273,9.76727272727273,35.21363636363637,9.3871,3.2933450000000004,758,31,128,12,10,236,113,176,0.08900000000000001,0.773,0.138,0.8771,0,0,7,0,0,0,22.0,1,1,0,3,3,4,0,0,17,0,17,11,0,3,1,27,27,13,0,1,6,0,2,0,0,1,4,0,0,1,5,7,7,1,5,7,0,1,0,1,1,2,4,2,10,3,18,19,3,16,0,0,0,1,18,9,0,9,5,86,15,1,0.12533510331555375,0.0,0.0,0.27326752554007994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13394510860544115,0.12550500135236328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08523216817840379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08763721842453985,0.12842062476404534,0.1031401107857958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14120974155537167,0.0,0.11084871363347157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433499685404897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10968159352979764,0.1282613261102307,0.0,0.4911227427082624,0.0,0.0,0.2094027923419189,0.14098512158628973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11264310920590452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12674638826966506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10660997485274283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13807074670657335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332253538907752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3972702540826801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13081728477930274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10655542281317476,0.1131198241514302,0.0,0.08366215470615944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263083050111699,0.1329607380756629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11848218451876252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14040399999932382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08029287657268477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10367849263984648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096489085851442,0.0,0.0,0.08871283122298541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10073960843570903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08326707343727302,0.1606193467898915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994851711430328,0.10053625978284852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Trifolium_pratense,2020/03/13,"What can I do for my boyfriend (28)? I feel at a loss. I don't really know how to start....I have lived with my boyfriend for most of our relationship, almost 2 years. His drinking has been a problem on and off for pretty much the entirety of it, though I didn't realize it at first. It's difficult because he can take ""breaks,"" from drinking after he's had an episode (like stopped completely) and he can go months drinking more moderately (though still more than I think the average healthy adult does?). 

He ruined my 30th birthday with a drunken episode, in which he came back at 3 am very intoxicated with a stolen, huge metal sign for our town's farmers' market. Then he fell/slumped backward on the bed into our bedroom window and broke it. This, after he was very rude to me at a restaurant and I walked out. I was convinced that I was going to break up with him the next morning, but he was so apologetic and seemed so humbled by it that I was sure he was going to shape up.

The worst of it is that when he drinks he tends to get mean-spirited. If I disagree with him on something or see he's getting pretty intoxicated and I try to ""stop the party"" he gets mean. He blacks out when he has a serious episode. Once he tried to get out of my (moving) car when I drove him home, then when I closed the door he started beating the dash with his fists, and when we got to our apartment building he kicked the elevator HARD so that the whole thing shook (it was terrifying). He is worst when he blacks out, and unfortunately he doesn't remember any of it so he doesn't realize how bad he was the night before or what it was like for me to deal with.

He hasn't had any major episodes like the ones I described above in 6+ months but a few weeks ago he stayed up late watching television while drinking beer. I had gotten into bed earlier to read and had fallen asleep. When I woke up it was 1:30 am and he was still up watching television. I kind of groggily walked into the living room and was like ""Geez I fell asleep, what time is it? What are you still doing up, hun?"" I brush my teeth, get back into bed, and am almost asleep when he starts getting upset with me over something that happened the day before. I was shocked because I'm well... essentially asleep, and its almost 2 am at this point. So I just said ""Babe, WHERE is this coming from?! It's 2 am! what are you doing?"" and that sets him off: ""Why do you have to be such a bitch, etc. etc."" I couldn't deal, and went to sleep on the couch. The next morning I told him I was moving out.

When I had the conversation with him about my leaving, I said ""look, I'm open to this being a break rather than a 'break up.' I'm open to working things out. I love you, I want to be with you, but I can't keep re-living this same pattern and subjecting myself to this."" We're good together, and I feel comfortable with him, like I can fully be myself. I've dropped by to see him in the almost three weeks since. We text each other. I don't WANT to officially end things. But 2 weeks into being separated, I went over to have dinner with him, and afterwards he says ""I'm gonna go have a couple beers with E. and play darts"" (this is a friend who he tends to get into trouble with). I was really upset; it just felt so disrespectful. Late that night, I get a text from him that he fell off his bike after drinking, broke his nose and cut his upper lip open so badly he needed stitches and would have a scar for the rest of his life. He texted me about what happened and just said ""you win, when you're right you're right."" 

I thought that might be a wake up call for him, but I think he still wants to believe that because he doesn't get into incidents like this all the time, and because he has successfully stopped drinking for a month or so previously after things had got out of control, that he doesn't need quit, he just needs to learn to ""moderate"".

I should add that he suffers from chronic depression (he's on antidepressants) and some social anxiety and I believe he's using alcohol to cope with his symptoms since even with the medication he's still suffering a lot.

**TL;DR** \- My boyfriend has had issues with drinking since we started dating, it took me awhile to figure that out. I moved out of our apartment and decided to take a ""break"" to let him work on things and figure his shit out. I'm not sure he understands the severity of his drinking problem.

I've already physically left our apartment. Should I/can I stage an intervention? How would I go about it? Should I just break up with him entirely, cut ties, and forget trying to resolve things? What can I do?",3.309146246246246,4.760860742702707,4.141713963963967,88.25085322822825,73.46486486486485,7.214564564564565,25.171546546546544,7.793537801064563,1.1712501501501498,3597,114,765,48,72,1154,354,925,0.11800000000000001,0.8009999999999999,0.081,-0.986,0,0,14,0,0,0,144.0,9,6,0,10,43,44,5,3,42,0,77,30,10,5,3,145,142,63,0,16,16,0,4,6,1,7,7,4,9,2,53,74,13,5,18,14,0,21,11,25,1,3,39,17,95,19,124,88,17,145,0,7,7,1,95,63,2,13,57,491,148,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04557202560051622,0.05494185113432251,0.20591948963888868,0.0,0.05673241568918363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06992137517626643,0.0,0.03932864952419756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07906251522421277,0.08585071133537787,0.1253566823200288,0.0,0.08749255893337134,0.1158433432922869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052495545173144906,0.05879955388935691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04428532076174006,0.053902599091703335,0.0,0.05766089209037464,0.0,0.05688439000663751,0.0,0.03315531518326596,0.10600328317938493,0.0442795155617261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04498939787073807,0.0,0.0,0.4532616683345477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04553416307097363,0.0,0.1146718881408004,0.03395594122209563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051989066779868205,0.0,0.04936183818086416,0.0,0.0,0.04372947566937375,0.0,0.0,0.03971938010481818,0.0,0.24173729017028514,0.0,0.1460879596454333,0.04312042262947132,0.0822348400217939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09092371065087132,0.0,0.04605342626591522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05156860560042879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053658874601478064,0.0,0.04569573309035265,0.0,0.05353579471597514,0.02825369226041125,0.0,0.11598585211061364,0.05443596109176782,0.05585731460171165,0.05257039559153035,0.0363125328589008,0.15069851244991006,0.0,0.0907922675001558,0.0,0.04317160600355288,0.0,0.0,0.04370709941339675,0.046399697634170636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200152209505662,0.0,0.051790351069640576,0.0,0.05453808021897388,0.0,0.0,0.12310535353360118,0.16392266648363554,0.03779240007195479,0.11435999854788555,0.0,0.0,0.10935062639398258,0.09648994884961523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054750167389283316,0.034836870723861844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04859924047748875,0.0,0.0,0.10460527746261986,0.0,0.09838520468129387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05468105816572655,0.05142409564606626,0.0,0.06586935973597435,0.0,0.0,0.055195297162027805,0.058237715885648994,0.08780803131019578,0.14670857145348304,0.040883441229997416,0.0,0.0,0.08193452001487077,0.046801900063382994,0.0,0.058078873825086176,0.05277181439413951,0.1275811047022736,0.0,0.05144731113989421,0.05240620765803485,0.0,0.07915614158860655,0.0,0.0,0.1455535694435817,0.05479641507692946,0.20528119404430825,0.12894364575427752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09690697872977726,0.05343486507745068,0.07730811956127302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2049278484662268,0.06588313923890357,0.10102048817694516,0.04081394298314465,0.05995538264766152,0.0,0.0,0.04912463329758672,0.05711860529485675,0.10471241946433596,0.0,0.0,0.05351981391396378,0.0,0.04440189196801803,0.0,0.08483757069846448,0.09096917434276368,0.0,0.12371444413535955,0.0,0.046223928919792885,0.09531550998907662,0.04638969410411491,0.05739763371366511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07485445149906607,0.0,0.0,0.07304063840109616,0.0,0.0,0.03310647250922687
alcoholism,Gimmemyspoon,2020/03/14,"How to give back trust My partner is an alcoholic; he has admitted it and is ""working on it.""  While he is definitely making some sort of attempt to control his drinking, he's still drinking a good bit daily and still drinking while at work occasionally. Granted he's not gotten blacked out or puked in my car for a couple of weeks now, I'm still having trouble trusting him about it at all. Several times in the past he has gotten black out and the broken up with me over stupid shit, only to conveniently forget about it by morning. He claims he doesn't want to break up or anything but I find it hard to believe that. So now I just feel it is almost impossible for me to actually trust him about anything at all. I'm always suspicious that he's at least had a little to drink and sometimes he's honest when he has, other times he's a complete liar about it. The more obviously wasted he is, the more likely he is to lie about it. 

He's sometimes really difficult to talk to about things like this. He gets very defensive, rarely apologizes,  and is just aggravated anytime I try to bring up past actions.  He acts like I'm just supposed to forget it all ever happened and just move forward, but that's hard to do when it has happened so many friggin times.   

I can't afford to do therapy right now, so can't work on it that way. Wondering what others have done to start trusting their alcoholic partners again. Also, no I am not open to any sort of alanon meetings.  I get they can be helpful for some, but I'm not one of those people.",5.312774805867125,5.721232367213116,6.107247627264888,79.86813632441763,67.95081967213115,8.781708369283868,31.134598792062125,8.6894789155246,2.3661475409836075,1212,46,237,18,19,399,162,305,0.129,0.7659999999999999,0.106,-0.6742,1,0,6,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,2,5,26,15,4,0,9,0,23,7,1,3,5,43,41,20,0,1,12,0,3,3,2,0,2,0,0,2,21,10,6,2,4,4,0,6,7,6,0,1,4,5,15,9,45,36,9,45,0,0,2,0,29,18,1,8,24,159,36,3,0.0,0.0,0.10636004745959247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329576779772908,0.10913931084899507,0.0,0.0,0.08716051699010319,0.09068971512379047,0.0,0.0,0.07411800324227857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793815464046253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08380778760369632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227961731600568,0.0,0.0,0.11899056292023988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11427558465990224,0.0,0.12224331046502925,0.0,0.1205970961617499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11153621440907784,0.0,0.4270809697133936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858911250541946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055109411255705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09961631796103024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11388719090361285,0.1045546427708176,0.0,0.09141695557911177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1927617660216941,0.0,0.19527007234570268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305475011576172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15974332321427612,0.10923818354402544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07275271750435558,0.11050034233656132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11584078731564595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07385550672460056,0.08289299827773816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2080895672763995,0.0755610294458186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06982278889925073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307820295211053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12312944782976112,0.1118782775797977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2155908939284305,0.0,0.07714479230956581,0.0,0.2611224193013755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08760329326639911,0.0,0.0,0.12464135591376975,0.0,0.07240915432399635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906615781341121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07399811980050837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899294575406202,0.06428605026609918,0.08651243298074733,0.08742646101592201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11819670546496397,0.23804147722726515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Kitchen_Particular,2020/03/14,"Alternative to In-Person AA Meetings During Coronavirus Over the last year, my brother and I have been creating a virtual reality platform for people to create support groups. We were focused on mental health issues until my friend said it could help people in AA right now. It's not completely finished, but it's pretty close and usable.

It's definitely not as good as the in-person meetings, but I am hoping it would be better than nothing until you can go back to in-person meetings. It would also be completely free; all you need is an Oculus Go or Rift headset. We aren't trying to make money off this unfortunate situation.

I just wanted to throw this out there to see if there's anyone that thinks they'd like this? I just want to make sure there would be a benefit to it before we rush to put it out for AA members to use during the Coronavirus outbreak.",8.551084337349398,7.249068295180724,8.851897590361444,68.5568825301205,61.83132530120483,11.191566265060242,35.207831325301214,10.125756701596842,3.5242192771084326,691,24,119,12,8,230,106,166,0.043,0.726,0.231,0.9846,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,3,2,1,1,8,9,0,0,6,0,15,1,0,3,2,30,28,11,0,9,8,1,0,1,1,3,1,1,0,0,12,8,0,0,1,0,2,5,3,0,3,0,3,2,12,10,23,17,1,21,0,0,1,0,14,9,0,3,8,84,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12030875268849668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10519284131893852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11568093834652254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12801542282139808,0.0,0.0,0.1330540990834221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3154720400463578,0.0,0.0,0.12011603452068045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11623144414359395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17099979382125371,0.1261839681555751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15991326246346835,0.0,0.0,0.100838386093959,0.0,0.0,0.14942327302436142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1570228052298642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12263065542288325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07349856957367955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20084297339910068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15161057967334554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155115167459208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14435356396538954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085956696543556,0.39408156726995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15305403095964687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15123618931165886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128477008700243,0.1431051968693192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988313464873783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691035886663145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1707202807393056,0.1417902048776966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09639743115631258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10214053107904324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12993395195320626,0.0,0.0,0.17746967984741496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3206099463332112,0.0,0.0,0.09687998906561096
alcoholism,idontlike-it,2020/03/14,"Need support with alcoholic boyfriend Hi All

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 7 months and his drinking is really severe. He drinks about 13-15 beers a day and drinks from the moment he wakes up until the time he goes to bed. 

Every aspect of life has been affected by this hygiene, work, finances. I just really don’t know how I can help him or what I can do for myself to relieve the stress I feel from this. Should I just realize it’s just not going to change? How do I not be a part of the problem and start being a part of the solution? Any advice would help. Thank you.",2.5684033613445365,4.244063697478996,3.627470588235294,90.25061764705885,75.89075630252101,6.776806722689076,21.984033613445376,7.554174236665415,0.7327472268907562,456,12,97,6,10,147,82,119,0.083,0.787,0.131,0.6972,0,0,5,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,0,1,7,5,0,1,8,0,13,7,1,3,1,21,20,7,0,4,6,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,4,4,5,0,3,4,1,1,3,2,0,0,2,1,11,3,16,14,3,9,0,0,0,0,9,1,0,1,7,66,15,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17369078116460976,0.0,0.18995581333541006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12087299041550413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1880311011938645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1146311005545048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5223685714056504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14975819442218247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08987343219083357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010168264083956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2382780356800677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09768424219878588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255468567416401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14187470979847105,0.0,0.0,0.13179598726473202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3849619681731565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17007837549662516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22773655317764185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20080174743433216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258091331867016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2036067943518742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20170341236623784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1636441149711227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10364479208052726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294007930449797,0.0,0.0,0.1262652566992808,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,abide95,2020/03/14,"[Relapse] Got wasted and took Xanax Hello friends,

Last night I decided to have some shots of whiskey for the first time in a long time as I seemingly forgot why I quit drinking in the first place. After Five or Six shots I decided to take a few Xanax and relax on my couch which I now know is a dangerous combination.

I have no memory of what followed. 

8 Hours of my life missing, and I'm terrified I did something stupid.

I do know this: I made a stupid mistake.

Alcohol makes me do dumb stuff, it also makes me extremely depressed and I can't touch the stuff anymore.

Thanks for reading, it's good to be back on the wagon.",4.845700000000001,5.354626000000003,5.6077499999999985,82.68762500000003,69.0,9.13,30.825,9.188382445141503,2.48614,490,19,100,9,8,160,85,125,0.22699999999999998,0.6859999999999999,0.087,-0.9583,1,0,4,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,3,3,11,4,0,8,0,8,6,0,3,0,16,22,7,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,7,4,3,1,5,4,0,2,2,7,0,4,5,1,14,4,14,16,2,18,0,2,0,0,2,5,1,3,11,66,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18809010709834093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14074686112739665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17454436599942802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13533287147196668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15158824561454987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17241265887979487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2994104345664663,0.0,0.0,0.13597689745709887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476201610075764,0.14076300258885405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17332420849647912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19344961603830926,0.143463209808645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243137617941656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15575415696479533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16653512977736604,0.23496227376413895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651637543906843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18388218065597012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18719729813066008,0.17604728377019585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16022347652258634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1354931335721915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4029549966016896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13232983770697346,0.0,0.0,0.16203683672782834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052536292552372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1955420934207652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15881231433156812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It culminated in me stripping my clothes off and urinating on the kitchen floor before going to bed. Something that wasn't a first in my apartment but definitely a first being back at home. My dad was the first one up and found my clothes lying next to the puddle of piss. I couldn't even look at him this morning when he told me.

I'm 23(m) now and I think about how I've gotten worse and don't want to hurt myself later in life due to substance abuse. I usually have at least 2 drinks a day (mostly beer) but will often have 5 or so days a week where I drink more than that. The past 2 weeks have been around 4-7 about 5 days a week, maybe 6. I don't want to just stop cold turkey because I want to avoid any potential issues that stopping may bring. Should I just gradually taper down or is there a better way?

alcoholism,terranT4,2020/03/14,"Praying it’s reversible  I had a physical about a month ago to get all my immunizations done for my clinical’s for school. Haven’t had one in years. Blood test came back with elevated liver enzymes so I had to go do an ultrasound. Today I saw the results online. I know I shouldn’t self diagnose and shouldn’t worry until I hear it from my doctor, but it sure was gut wrenching to read “ABNORMAL: call patient”. So until I find out whether it’s alcohol induced fatty liver, or the other stated which is liver disease, I’ll try to stay positive. These usually don’t have many symptoms and catching it early is the best chance of reversing any damage. So I’m hoping that’s just the case. I was naive to think that just drinking beer and no hard alcohol couldn’t do much damage.",6.094705882352944,6.208754156862747,6.927581699346407,75.67411764705884,66.25490196078431,9.937254901960783,32.68627450980392,9.725611199111238,3.0830862745098035,618,24,114,12,9,206,103,153,0.11,0.752,0.138,0.7519,0,0,4,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,1,7,5,0,0,7,0,16,14,5,2,2,22,25,11,0,4,5,0,1,0,0,2,7,1,0,1,10,6,4,0,4,3,0,3,6,2,0,1,8,3,11,3,15,14,3,16,1,2,1,0,3,2,0,2,9,76,21,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565827130737471,0.3775537294444379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12012279992688245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13582700102869075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853751628680125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18037150596622525,0.20203169716944103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17928818427485926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1808008468217737,0.0,0.1807663695994036,0.0,0.17304217475261469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16144783329861429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228829466999,0.0,0.10038987193244672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15823677653198473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19908867461061952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17544562958155133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09707797119370992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17908753519651227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14099417348096202,0.0,0.12985239209485838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11969737269874375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17669007044386706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17877140624042526,0.0,0.0,0.18427641033174624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18827715525911592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664832476210641,0.18359895212693972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11318523317653575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1674362163350678,0.0,0.0,0.11992850523382075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19454650296215573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17938879811943098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11375182949378153
alcoholism,thesouthdowns,2020/03/15,"My wife has blackouts.. My wife and myself are not heavy drinkers. However sometimes when she drinks she 'blacks out'. These blackouts are incredibly destructive and scary for me.
They are scary for me as in the morning she has no idea what has happened

She gets incredibly violent and aggressive, destroyed her phone, throwing things around our room, telling me she hates me and other things along those lines. When this happens I literally cannot see the person I love and feel she barely recognises me; and the person she becomes HATES me.

After the most recent episode she has said she will never drink again. 

Does anybody have any experience with this type of thing? Sorry if I haven't explained the situation very well but I am willing to talk further with anyone who has some insight

alcoholism,MargitSlachta,2020/03/15,"Thinking of Giving My Mother an Ultimatum. Need Advice. My mother recently relapsed after almost a year sober. I spent Christmas with her and my sister, and I really regretted it. I had a horrible time. She's an angry drunk, and she says such hurtful, hateful things when she's drinking.

She's had a problem with alcohol, to a greater or lesser extent, my whole life, It's always been something of a struggle, but it's only after almost a year of being able to have a relationship with my mother as she could be - kinder, less erratic, and most importantly, HAPPIER - that I really feel that I'm not capable of putting up with it any more. It's just too exhausting.

I know my mum is sorry and ashamed, but that doesn't really help. I haven't seen her since Christmas. Tonight she messaged me, inviting me to stay with her while my workplace is shut due to the coronavirus, and I told her, truthfully, that I have other plans. But I can't keep putting off the decision forever. I don't live far away. And what I really wanted to say to her was, ""I'm won't set foot in that house if you're going to be drinking.""

Is that a bad idea? Will it help or hinder her addiction? Complicating the matter is that my mother refuses to use the ""A"" word, even as she acknowledges that she needs to quit drinking. Alcoholics are people who can't hold down a job and who collapse in pools of their own vomit behind seedy bars at 3 o'clock in the morning. Not hard-working middle-class people like her. So I don't know if an ultimatum will only serve to make her dig her heels in.

Thank you all in advance, and I wish you all the best in your fight.",4.596535855448899,5.5327651583850965,5.729361942405423,80.05486730660645,69.77639751552796,8.960135516657258,28.92207792207793,9.218907990703514,2.408877018633541,1279,46,248,25,22,426,177,322,0.13699999999999998,0.742,0.121,-0.1656,1,0,6,0,1,0,47.0,0,3,1,4,6,13,2,2,19,0,24,13,2,2,3,51,44,21,0,9,10,6,1,1,0,3,6,2,0,0,19,14,7,3,7,6,1,4,9,9,0,0,7,4,44,4,36,30,10,30,0,2,1,0,39,13,0,7,12,176,63,1,0.11444357173259405,0.0,0.0,0.1247603856941714,0.0,0.11183293377696643,0.0,0.2446107473390433,0.2291974115010134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952262195649024,0.0,0.0,0.07782555321545895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10752350289478332,0.0,0.09555560208553122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12010146792607565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09137387967028993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3363333935254336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07558889978634736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05786610851258045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10978470221715342,0.06504091916877873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10251896126404476,0.11298933376009893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15341822753080098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13205251629134646,0.12251421051799202,0.12919286236667046,0.0,0.0,0.11356758601178933,0.10172270492041953,0.0,0.0,0.12579038813253776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08083487921323768,0.055911348380449206,0.0,0.10105577054331123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639197280040504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16971691666097294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17407898665497648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15868152569971022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950704220612713,0.0,0.2300947982357421,0.0,0.12172482567530622,0.0,0.0,0.2932619301881419,0.0,0.11299922051056935,0.12286956672970392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18202024334076602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09466890516444038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08810425272679034,0.0,0.1281102089214192,0.0,0.12198162026519985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11964126953833387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053642648725948,0.0,0.0,0.07603122381356958,0.0733308197373553,0.0,0.0,0.06673296700810022,0.0,0.0,0.10935573716201574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09884250123836208,0.0,0.0,0.06750178373858419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12777216082387666,0.13160445952999467,0.0,0.0,0.08331628323768937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14739581603180607
alcoholism,Myneckmyguac,2020/03/15,"I don’t know if I should stay and help or leave. I was with Jake* for 3 years. He was a personal trainer when we met and I knew he liked to drink and lived very much the “work hard play hard” lifestyle but it didn’t seem like an actual problem. Within a year it was clear the drinking was more than that of a normal person, and he’s a very bad drunk (not physically abusive but definitely verbally, and can get aggressive with other men) we ended up getting engaged and he promised things would improve, they didn’t. He lost his job, gained weight which made him feel worse about himself and that just made him drink even more. I stuck around for another year and a half begging, pleading, offering help, booking doctors appointments, everything I could before leaving and whilst he didn’t take it well and the first 4 months or so were very tough, he eventually seemed to sort himself out.

He got back in touch 11 months after the breakup and he seemed to have changed, more stable job, much less drinking, working out again  and back to the same old happy Jake I fell in love with. That was December. Since then there have been at least 4 times where he has seriously crossed the line with drinking, but he drinks in excess without fail every weekend. 

This weekend I’m in self isolation with suspected corona. I have weakened lungs from childhood asthma and whilst unlikely deadly, it could be dangerous for me. He went out Friday night “for a few pints” and I took a turn, almost ended up in hospital and I couldn’t reach him. I called him at 3PM Saturday and he was slurring down the phone clearly still drunk. He knew I was upset with him but proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the day and then get drunk and go out again Saturday night. 

He doesn’t remember what happened, the whole weekend is a blur. 

I’ve ended things but he’s begging me not to, he says that this is the wake up call he needed and he’s going to get help this time. I said I’ve heard it all 1000 times. He’s called me in tears begging me for one more chance because he can’t do this without me. At this point I don’t know if I’m helping or enabling and I feel like I’m drowning myself trying to save him. 

I just need some advice from people who have been there, what helped you? I can’t carry on like this but I don’t want to abandon someone that needs me either.",3.609214235787508,5.270564834051727,3.949086672879776,89.08566169617895,73.07327586206897,6.912767940354147,25.68709226467847,7.534196372845213,1.180420619757688,1849,61,378,22,37,576,238,464,0.13699999999999998,0.7090000000000001,0.154,0.8746,2,1,6,0,0,0,42.0,2,1,1,7,16,22,2,1,20,0,34,15,2,2,3,86,70,35,2,13,18,0,6,4,0,2,2,3,0,4,23,33,10,2,11,14,0,6,14,11,1,3,25,9,39,11,50,39,15,63,0,3,0,1,54,22,0,12,38,233,62,7,0.0,0.08855624227052894,0.0729367466409994,0.0,0.0,0.07303635276634111,0.0,0.0,0.07484263550174362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07837279071327438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06653562077606437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11494292296768238,0.062405880155461065,0.04556161487695312,0.0,0.06359935826228356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2289577325438561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07906640609108423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11934972434038076,0.0,0.0,0.048201968129547516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07650090796136012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4393082350073089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985958750523772,0.0,0.0,0.04936593688068252,0.0,0.06297278556829612,0.0,0.06717267896289987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755829141166763,0.05339521385858526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0635749285110353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1561970192190392,0.0,0.08495442900803883,0.0,0.059777461260111686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06609350233572085,0.07956352482487025,0.1339070838479928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25048765619153895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14833845441846424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08215174950686348,0.0,0.0,0.15828053192334104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14605933426016768,0.0,0.06599795478133001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08158897973242371,0.0,0.06745695929055026,0.14144408808600445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193156169139817,0.0,0.109886939921289,0.1662592249487186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1402793311890536,0.07323062440074768,0.0,0.0,0.07842844237413882,0.0,0.05064665267342349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0518162203971988,0.1305224752298328,0.0,0.0,0.07065470581918844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0715173490924961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08466734547812481,0.0,0.07109611079896484,0.0594372974680449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20412507160203988,0.07797149711436542,0.0,0.0,0.061826792162877627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06332807779229117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07966430234645203,0.059688514606028274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056196170880144565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09930962367095177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307467940330132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08304035648005208,0.05074445005160852,0.08129709352264039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850082493436637,0.04408436694794037,0.0,0.0,0.0910147921889372,0.06720142264667348,0.06928595233297476,0.0,0.0834460144831896,0.0,0.14409593043438432,0.0,0.10882514207959716,0.0,0.07616779029058411,0.053094089211801525,0.0,0.0,0.1443928785430687

alcoholism,throwawayacc_2032,2020/03/15,"Starting my journey. Questions related to Bloating, etc. I [29M] have been drinking about 4-5 times every week since a year and a half and occasionally try to take a break but it doesn't last more than 3-4 days max. I have finally decided to quit once and for all. I have gained several pounds and have immense bloating and gases and stomach problems. Have got a detox diet from my doctor. The doctor advised me to take a blood test and my cholesterol was high and triglycerides were off the chart. My question is how long does it usually take for the bloating to subside and things to start returning back to normal. I used to be slim with an athletic body and had a decent amount of stamina but all that has changed drastically. 
Just need some encouragement and want to know if anyone was in a similar state and managed to turn things around.

alcoholism,Useless_Space12,2020/03/15,"How do I talk to my partner about their alcoholism? 
Hey everyone, before I get into the question of this topic, let me provide a crumb of context. My partner and I have been together on and off for nearing two years now. During this time, he has coped and tried to overcome alcoholism. And I’ll admit, I haven’t been the most helpful person when it comes to such things. 

In the past, I would become angry and disappointed due to some of the things he’s done and said while drinking. I also would have little patience as I felt like I had to treat him like a child in order to take care of him while he’s drunk. 

My whole life, I’ve never been raised around good role models for drinking responsibly. I’ve had old friends in high school who are now alcoholics. The town I was raised in had a huge problem with drunk drivers killing high schoolers and other people at least a few times a month. So I’ve never had a proper example of what drinking responsibly is like nor have I been taught how to talk to someone about their drinking problem. 

Now, presently, my partner has corrected their drinking problem (kind of). But last night, we were at one of their friends houses drinking, and my partner had way too many beers. My partner ended up being overwhelming, and I was tired as hell and just wanted to sleep. I tried my best to be patient, but my patience wore thin. Everything they did began to bug me, and I started to blame the alcohol once again. They ended up becoming very frustrating during the whole night, and we woke up and had a bit of an argument over the whole thing. They had to go off to work, and we decided we’d talk about it later. 

But that’s the thing guys. I don’t know how to talk about it without getting upset and disappointed and angry. I don’t know how to go about this. Please give this stupid redditor some advice on how to talk to their partner about alcoholism.",6.068011363636362,6.317285904891302,6.036353754940713,81.57801383399213,66.30978260869566,8.864822134387351,31.40118577075099,8.575989854853784,2.308620652173913,1495,54,289,20,22,471,185,368,0.11699999999999999,0.8059999999999999,0.077,-0.96,0,0,12,0,0,0,39.0,4,0,8,2,22,21,4,2,17,0,33,17,1,5,3,51,52,32,1,6,5,0,2,3,8,2,7,1,0,9,15,23,14,0,6,9,0,3,7,11,0,2,22,3,39,10,55,24,10,53,1,3,0,0,41,23,1,4,28,208,54,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07328771216616338,0.0,0.4007531913516301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059976310971037165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06676460748024136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16566000573647033,0.06381823962637675,0.0,0.07870634807501424,0.0,0.0818789889134482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07646601709762739,0.0,0.0,0.0646046074490962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07674955256048682,0.0,0.4408201431202687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13285290385724635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07166432568810166,0.06740385814462306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0720103665003969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11588738280112636,0.0,0.0783672907542362,0.07194544026167594,0.08524680524916932,0.06290522297453628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07426035282359841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05026994517886866,0.15848016530580464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865382537855864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0829747803397037,0.07809944565398863,0.08243448014261219,0.061133825759696316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669109565462856,0.05297369174434124,0.10992150528127544,0.07516824695855844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07603675521034584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05986312471883151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11568700598082896,0.0,0.0,0.1407621117108022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07869835900411114,0.07987100490898592,0.05082095645143013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0715945994114228,0.051994549319259925,0.06548583844583444,0.0,0.08232588300807969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2152904422245476,0.0,0.0,0.08401553690774728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07134079272876077,0.0,0.0,0.07590253358502437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07505271009295457,0.0,0.0635460255268487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053084357609764536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05638957368915301,0.3014049560782842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1993028085126637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08746451180181837,0.08619979708962397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10183818081141696,0.0,0.07326268274221204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06188165579060704,0.04423608618908361,0.05953035574471725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511995982503058,0.0,0.0722959230164178,0.0,0.05459983547293786,0.0,0.0,0.10655363200645332,0.0,0.0,0.04829660536930607
alcoholism,Fashiontoast1993,2020/03/15,"Help please, how to manage the fall out of a bender Hey everyone, i was looking for a place to find some advice on how to handle a binge drinking situation and i stumbled across this reddit. I am sorry if this is the wrong place! 

My boyfriend is in a band and i went to one of his gigs last night and drank a lot of vodka. I went completely off the rails as i was so drunk and we ended up in a massive fight afterwards and i was really nasty to him, to the point that he got into his car, drove away and slept in it overnight to get away from me. He came back this morning understandably angry at me and said he doesn't want to break up over it but no longer wants to be around me if i drink again and has said he will just drive away again if i drink when he's there. 

My binge drinking like last night has happened before, but not that often. The first time it happened, he forgave me but as it has happened a few times, he is getting more and more angry with me. Which is perfectly understandable. I feel so awful that i acted this way and i have no idea what to do. I am a completely different person when drunk and i hate it.  

Have any of you had massive drunk arguments with a partner? How did you help the situation afterwards? What do i do to move forward from this? Have any of you guys managed to reconcile with loved ones after drunken moments? 

I have currently moved to my parents to allow him some space, i just wish i could go back in time and not drink. 

Any help is massively appreciated",3.345516749821812,4.6199090655737765,4.322066999287241,87.69456165359944,73.09836065573771,7.533856022808268,25.064148253741983,8.04050195162591,1.249856735566643,1175,36,252,17,23,381,158,305,0.138,0.747,0.115,-0.7064,3,0,6,0,1,0,23.0,1,3,0,2,16,6,2,0,15,1,26,11,1,4,1,49,50,27,0,7,10,1,1,1,1,1,0,2,0,3,16,20,9,0,6,10,0,12,5,3,0,3,14,4,34,3,45,33,6,55,0,0,1,1,28,22,0,7,22,182,50,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09017478251817246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882603477851147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214861375112684,0.0,0.0,0.2600998157251111,0.14191498737311686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07852333916432587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055435426521504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935072935077731,0.0,0.0,0.07367793590699058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09641278228304916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4519955137610445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173253986338769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08817733276465503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04665945508236004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08434209343674698,0.07849317682156991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642480562470504,0.0,0.05244475435584652,0.0,0.07380461050491054,0.0,0.0,0.09137154057160546,0.2448082484918911,0.0,0.0,0.09110722802828453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855596759560672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417269647998954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1504407568320755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04508326402810699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749181648846774,0.0,0.0,0.07845301207250484,0.08328615001933531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19615771206048094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17319673974187275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250624029573424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10246583137061367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.080575188736751,0.1928255645660983,0.10129554295593901,0.08723426745464458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05911682248342719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17555850165998702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20745279207920755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10329971536726308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1614273340646429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19213311628835444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10885807002711816,0.07324743430847283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17108865507505974,0.0,0.0,0.1061172511150124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008935085005048,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,looking4helpCA,2020/03/15,"Advise on avoiding withdrawal symptoms I'm seeking advise on how to reduce my withdrawal symptoms from alcohol.

I'm a 40 year old male who has been drinking in excess daily for about 8 years now (15-20 drinks per day). In the past I've gone through bouts of difficulty sleeping (night sweats, sleep paralysis), the shakes, and anxiety when cutting this down to under 10. I've been taking vitamins (and B-complex) for a number of years, but no drugs aside from caffeine. 

Recently, I've been able to cut down to under 12 drinks per day (as low as 6). But while doing so, I experienced extreme headaches (this has subsided) and an inability to get a good amount of sleep (this is improving).

What should I do from here in order to be as safe as possible? When should I try to go cold-turkey? If I continue to tapper, how should I do it? I don't have any urge to start drinking heavily again (yet), as I'd rather be healthy with this COVID-19 pandemic active.",6.891576086956519,6.462108483695655,7.233826086956522,75.97204347826091,64.70652173913044,10.838260869565218,35.24782608695652,10.355215969177356,3.5278930434782607,747,31,143,16,10,244,120,184,0.095,0.804,0.1,0.4479,0,1,6,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,0,0,11,7,2,2,6,0,16,13,4,2,0,15,23,17,0,5,4,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,1,7,4,5,2,0,4,0,3,2,5,0,0,4,1,7,2,34,14,1,31,0,1,0,0,4,10,0,1,17,88,14,2,0.14651344765980642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565783179636555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996341685688681,0.0,0.11208238643481062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18897810597093376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5741096018181365,0.1699090843442876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07654722928270152,0.0,0.08326696870879427,0.12288852861360405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137492945535591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15374121710426525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13986366413344722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16517189818639924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14466435405003206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4398577737584708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10370297235418756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30456714223141085,0.11015987881663653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09947301356571857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830495699825312
alcoholism,The7footr,2020/03/15,"Grateful for a Calm Mind So last night I'm not sure what I would have done if I had still been drinking. I came up on an accident on the freeway- dark, raining, curvy road going about 60mph- the two cars must have hit right before I turned the corner, but one was half way in my lane. I had just spent 16 out of the last 20 hours driving (I drive for work, and yes I take plenty of breaks), and was just listening to a podcast on my way home finally.

&amp;#x200B;

I had the presence to already know what cars were around me, slow down, move over, throw my flashers on, and call 9-11 all within about 5 seconds. I didn't stop because it didn't look like a safe situation as more cars were following at high speeds. But man, if I had still been drinking, even if I was dry while driving (which somehow I always was when driving, although i can remember waking up still drunk from the night before and having to take the bus to work at 6AM, and sleeping in stock rooms, ah good times), I'm not sure I would have missed hitting a car there. All thanks to my higher power and groups like this. Felt like sharing, thanks for listening, will probably go share at a meeting today if they aren't all cancelled. :)

alcoholism,whydoitbelikethattho,2020/03/15,"WHAT COULD THIS BE? HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS?  

I am a daily drinker at a pint or more a day. This has been going on at this rate for a couple months. I've been drinking daily overall for the last 6-7 months.

A couple weeks ago I started getting random numbness feeling in my left foot and leg that I brushed off as a potential injury from moving things. It comes and goes. A couple days ago I started getting blurry vision and sparks/flashes in my vision like floaters (similar to looking at a camera flash light or the sun by accident and looking away and seeing dots) and that would come and go. Around 6 hours ago I had a few shots of vodka and ate a sandwich. Well not long after I felt heavy and numb and a brain fog clouded my head, and my vision started to blur. It made me very anxious to the point I had an anxiety attack. I ended up puking. My friend tried talking to me and I had trouble interpreting her as if I had confusion but I knew she was talking and I could respond it just felt really passive. Afterwards, I still felt heavy and more exhausted. I felt like I was going to lose consciousness. I had an orange juice and some pretzels and started to feel a little better. The feeling of anxiety attack went away for the most part, but I still feel odd after the ordeal and a bit confused. I am currently back home and I feel extremely tired and my vision is still a bit weird and my foot feels kind of numb. I have a random pain in my left side that I'm not sure if it is related. I just overall feel really exhausted as I'm typing this. My friend told me it could be low blood sugar. Sometimes I would get similar symptoms as I did earlier when I wake up and I figured it was just slight withdrawal because I would also feel shaky so I would drink and they would go away temporarily. This has been going on for a couple weeks.

alcoholism,shygirlll,2020/03/15,"“Moderate drinking” isn’t working. I need to stop completely. I don’t have access to AA meetings. Any advice for quitting completely and on my own? I’m not surprised. I’ve had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I need to stop completely. It’s hard to imagine. Why can’t I just control it? How will I feel less shy and anxious without drinking? I use it as a crutch to feel confident and numb pain. What will social events and holidays with family be like? Drinking is a very big part of my families life, but I don’t want it to be like that for my future family.

I’m 21 but I began drinking when I was 15. I’ve tried to drink “like a normal person” for about two years now. Basically just closet alcoholism. Before, I was drinking the same large amount, just more frequently and in public. It was more noticeable. At first it was just the thing to do, and then I started drinking to help me cope. I’ve had mental health problems from a young age. I would drink when I got sad. I would drink no matter what activity I was doing. At the movies, concerts, parties, home in my room and even before school some days. There are many times where I should’ve died. Even back then, people would pull me aside and suggest that I get help. I lost friends. I know that if I don’t stop now, I might either lose everything or die from drinking. I don’t want to miss out anymore or ruin relationships. I have an amazing relationship and I need to stay focused as I’m close to graduating college.

I’m just stuck in the moderate drinking attempt and fail. When I met my fiancé is around the time I started my attempt at controlling it. I basically go without it for a while and then I blackout and am right back where I was. He knew about my struggles with it in the past and he has tried to offer advice and remind me of my limits, but I surpass them almost every single time I drink. It’s not like I’m a raging alcoholic every single day. But when it’s bad, it’s bad. My fiancé has seen me go through these cycles of “okay I’m being healthy now and taking a break” then just completely blacking out. I have never done anything to ever directly hurt him, like I’m not going out to clubs/bars or getting arrested but at the same time these relapse moments still do hurt him. They’re not fair to him. I’m not being the best person I can be. He thought that I was going to actually die at one point and I hate that. I’ve seen alcohol ruin too many relationships. 

I don’t have normal hangovers either. It’s not an “ow I have a headache” hangover. I had a somewhat high tolerance back then, but now I  get sick for hours on end and have severe pain to the touch on my stomach and back after I drink. I think it’s an allergy but I don’t know. It’s 2 am now and I’m still hungover after drinking yesterday afternoon.. And the mental mess it creates is horrible. I try to pick up the pieces that I broke. Most of the time I’m totally alone but other times I have to apologize to people for quite literally taking care of me when I get so drunk I’m laying on the floor, and then I reply back to worried friends who I abruptly stopped replying too because I passed out. Someone has to make sure I’m laying on my side so I don’t accidentally die. Then I make the same excuse about how I’m really petite so I misjudged my limits. Feel like a terrible person. Repeat. 

I hate drinking and the cons definitely outweigh the pros, so why do I still do it? I become someone I hate when I drink. But I drink (partially) because I’m someone I hate. Yet I know deep down that one cannot hate themselves into health.

I’m in a long distance relationship and although my fiancé is very supportive, we can’t physically be together until the end of this year. The people that I’m surrounded with in my everyday life aren’t the best influences. They don’t really acknowledge drinking problems in general and they all drink a ton. It’s hard to not give in and agree to drink, and view it as one harmless night. Although I think I tend to have the most trouble not drinking when I’m depressed and alone.

I won’t have a car for a few months so I can’t go to AA meetings. I would go back to therapy but it’s crazy expensive. I’ve never tried to be completely sober and idk how to do this. Any advice is appreciated.",2.198266626841896,4.246302724654377,3.883038061102578,86.30959236502247,78.20506912442397,6.8670649143767415,25.00176366843033,7.879130955064827,1.444914701029755,3367,124,683,56,81,1125,335,868,0.214,0.6859999999999999,0.1,-0.9989,1,2,24,0,0,0,86.0,1,0,3,15,48,45,6,1,39,1,67,34,1,10,7,132,134,71,4,14,32,0,7,6,2,8,11,1,3,3,38,41,25,8,12,24,1,10,28,28,2,5,20,12,91,17,88,99,25,124,0,11,4,0,32,38,0,10,80,458,129,5,0.0,0.0,0.034280952515712795,0.0,0.0,0.10298330497633017,0.0,0.11262703366051345,0.035176738090808235,0.07276634538461647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0477780108301154,0.0,0.0,0.03968590514160485,0.034838646377065734,0.0,0.0,0.02890827158021115,0.031272363540624216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1620727438118576,0.05866269371296735,0.042828769531599774,0.038797351763551965,0.05978458543950418,0.0,0.07373168577933073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03581647785300432,0.0,0.0,0.030260625304288125,0.18416106352903447,0.0,0.07880058765500783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04531075093728031,0.0,0.030256658550081143,0.0,0.14583391658093126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03594928510531721,0.0,0.722676415272624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0622279447697037,0.0,0.0,0.04640490331794058,0.03177629913759256,0.05919559539650296,0.0,0.031571786841750445,0.0,0.09934982038872674,0.0,0.053287013936603685,0.025096249492208084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0298808105083692,0.0,0.0,0.05428134009176692,0.0,0.0734140586952617,0.033699051756115546,0.1197881266006589,0.0,0.02809596541307523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944063711568856,0.17341366007165154,0.0,0.07468122115251136,0.0,0.0,0.047092615687617835,0.03711584273814582,0.035237370412982735,0.0,0.034595105799137826,0.0,0.07521289647330061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057918134965409464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049625471004477006,0.10297387804177544,0.0,0.0,0.031088164692020345,0.0,0.03930049826030569,0.0383475829238652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046897919166562906,0.07123082546665463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0708037785936119,0.0372664436416906,0.0,0.0,0.028039727477452092,0.0,0.0,0.07814338941959884,0.054187484125171013,0.0,0.0,0.032966298285127364,0.0688381556181687,0.0,0.03999473459178995,0.0,0.0,0.07141320014957164,0.0,0.074759718387491,0.0,0.0,0.03804141235633817,0.033534718840397215,0.07306232342895222,0.0920201746372935,0.0,0.0,0.033208372003773086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06722764480727107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07472828395203067,0.0,0.0,0.04500922607578205,0.0,0.0,0.15086210755614127,0.0,0.030000075515774924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03555254368308526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03968590514160485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035809712705718616,0.08929436509121293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049729142195117336,0.03744296656633393,0.08416247896334661,0.11747806518949525,0.0,0.036724582322633766,0.0,0.0,0.039864107719094,0.03310877873606696,0.0,0.052825450934610566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04017320888463593,0.0,0.023338225587261785,0.045018641755014986,0.0,0.027888596369172867,0.1433885017256643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09540146292608563,0.0,0.034316044610221204,0.0,0.0,0.030340279635198926,0.0,0.05797040406333088,0.04144012886854189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339713147016203,0.0,0.0,0.06772643388170868,0.0,0.025574416874588814,0.035675325352757935,0.0,0.0998188723768306,0.0,0.0,0.04524400151184842
alcoholism,Manray1024,2020/03/15,"Question about AA So I've been drinking heavily since the beginning of the summer. Long story short, I was in denial of my problem and now (after many many many mistakes) have accepted I have a problem (hell I'm typing this with one hand and a beer in the other) My question is though, if I were to go to AA, would I be forced to share an account of my addiction? I know its recommended and definitely would help, but I dont feel ready for that. I can't tell a group of strangers the various mistakes I've made and how embarrassed I am to be 18 and already failing college because of my drinking. I'm even embarrassed to say this on a pretty anonymous platform like Reddit so ill probably delete it after I hear a few answers

She was once an alcoholic and that being a majority of her life. So many years have passed and my recollection of events is in shambles. I don’t remember her qualities/traits, personality, humor too well anymore which hurts. But remembering the alcohol problem is not an issue and sticks with me.

I have a need to feel what she felt. I get an understanding of how she felt a lot of her life. It just makes me feel closer somehow and it’s comforting.

alcoholism,jnh4mx99,2020/03/15,"Advice/alcohol changes my mom Hi all. First post ever so sorry if the formatting isn’t right or whatever may be. 

Came home from school Thursday after classes were moved to online due to coronavirus. I knew it would be straining on me mentally, but not so soon.

My family dynamic is a bit complicated. I grew up witnessing my parents domestic violence quite often and when I was quite young. This has caused a lot of issues for me personally, but my parents have never tried to hear me or validate anything they have put me through. They “make up” for it by paying for my college tuition. Which I am thankful for, yet any time I have mentioned therapy or the abuse is brought up, my mom turns it into a joke and acts like I am dramatic. My parents have never gone to therapy either and the physical abuse is no longer, but their marriage is quite the roller coaster and not exactly a happy one. 

Anyway, my mom drinks. Every single night. It depends but on weekdays she may start as soon as 4/5 and weekends like today it started at 2. She drinks wine and seltzer’s, never hard alcohol. But that doesn’t matter. When she has a few, she changes a lot. If me and my siblings are in the kitchen (we always hand out at the island) she will just sit against the counter and stare and become very slurry and just straight up confrontational and rude. We all hate being around her when she is drunk. 

Tonight, me and my two younger sisters had come back from the store and were sitting at the island. My mom is staring at me, I ask why, she asks what’s wrong. I was just quiet and sitting on my phone because I could tell that she was drunk and I don’t like engaging her or talking to her when she is. So I just sat there. I told her my stomach hurt (cramps) and she asked why I was drinking a soda. I simply explained that the soda wasn’t why and I had been feeling icky all day. A few minutes go by and she is making a comment that my sisters lemonade was “disgusting and filled with fake sugar, just like soda” and I said “eh, a lot of things are bad for you” and she then raises her voice and says “then don’t bitch!” I explained that I had not complained at all and only mentioned it when she asked. We then get into a fight, and she uses her favorite jab at me “if you are going to come home from college and act like this...” yada yada. She loves this line and I can’t ever seem to escape it. I’m pretty financially dependent on them (my dad is the only one who works and we have no issues however) and yet she is always the one to throw money and stuff in my face. I don’t know how I am going to continue to live here until August. Any advice on how to handle her and not let her anger and alcoholic tendencies to get to me would be extremely appreciated.

alcoholism,bllaaushpibu,2020/03/16,"I’ve been sober since mid December but I just kind of hit a wall. I’m in my early twenties. I don’t even know if I can be called an addict? Started drinking when I went away to college. Have had mental health issues since I was a teenager, never got diagnosed with anything or got any support for it. When I started drinking it pretty immediately turned into problematic drinking, bingeing, drinking to feel numb or better, depending on the day. Drinking to forget. Always hiding my drinking and how much I was consuming. I haven’t had a drink since mid December but the cravings have hit full force. Why after this long? I don’t understand it. But I was so visibly not doing well that one of my coworkers asked me on Saturday at work if I was doing okay. She happens to be a recovering addict herself, with about 2 years under her belt. I guess I’m just reaching out here for anything. I have no support here, I’m back living with my parents and I can’t broach the subject with them because they believe drinking to be equivalent to the devil, basically.",3.6753420908593353,5.877146487684732,5.0260673234811195,79.11514915161467,74.27093596059113,7.269731800766285,30.4896004378763,8.167268648758528,2.485077941981391,839,39,146,14,18,279,124,203,0.114,0.79,0.096,-0.5833,1,0,8,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,2,2,12,8,0,0,9,1,20,13,0,2,1,26,39,13,0,2,10,1,1,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,8,8,0,3,8,0,1,7,2,1,1,10,1,24,6,24,24,2,25,1,0,0,0,8,12,0,6,12,108,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20639237566814686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07876685204418604,0.0,0.0,0.06437380233498577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15579847952796025,0.0,0.08849673628862822,0.0,0.08893861252166667,0.0727896829019724,0.0,0.057705431770299714,0.0,0.0,0.10665231431908133,0.0,0.08372136169987289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09666108081897118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06104953458312925,0.0,0.0,0.09608052877999404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7418663407726969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06252374307053205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04786424609113811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15142062990800598,0.0,0.10428150716673808,0.0,0.08370980922854282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10062189875801307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09880314219809032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09857651278181227,0.05202407979591883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08358879479796108,0.08377340680663778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09539761845594316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06958789028000995,0.0,0.07300961951947199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414581590519232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051115954954707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09630587838982772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23491759980633226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13400532648123858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2148439540268185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10296570690182973,0.0,0.09854708701645112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08511303034094783,0.08775316252043447,0.08541825703829661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06891548761086537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0609595996058443
alcoholism,PhoSho862,2020/03/16,"Rehab Options in the US/Experiences So....I'm a 33/M in Florida that recently got out of the hospital and was diagnosed with Stage 1 Cirrosis. Clearly this is problematic, but I was told it was also somewhat reversible at this stage. I want a proper Rehab facility option in the US. I have good insurance as well as a father that is willing to help with the cost (he's also dealt with this).

Right now, I'm also concerned about COVID-19 and doing something like this. But that is almost a secondary concern considering I know I need immediate treatment.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on what you think my immediate decisions should be, since I'm a little bit torn about traveling and doing something like this, even though I know I should seek treatment. It's a weird predicament to be in with how things are evolving daily. And also, maybe positive Rehab experiences/places?

alcoholism,BonzoMarx,2020/03/16,"Quitting seems impossible I’m 25, been drinking heavily since 19, and it’s gotten to the point where quitting seems impossible for me. I’ve created such a habit that I can’t even fall asleep without drinking, and when I start I don’t stop. So I’m hungover every single day. I’ve always had depression and anxiety problems really bad. The depression and anxiety has been pretty low for a while now, but lately it’s rising into a real problem, and I know it’s obviously because of the alcohol.

The other day something triggered me, I don’t know what. But I wasn’t drunk yet and I blacked out, something that rarely happens even if I drink a lot. I went into a full meltdown, and continued drinking all night. I got violent, I was screaming, my neighbors had to get involved and I don’t remember any of it. that’s never happened before and I’ve been riddled with anxiety ever since. I’m hoping it’s just the alcohol severely fucking with me and I’m not just losing my mind. This has gotten really bad but the anxiety that rises when I don’t drink for a while is unbearable. The only time I’m not scared is when I’m drunk, but then i either feel like shit the next day, or I could become violent again. I don’t know what to do. I feel stupid even writing this post.

alcoholism,lepipizzara,2020/03/16,"Mom with failing liver, she refuses help. Please help me, help her. Hi all- 

My mom has battled wit alcoholism my entire life, even before I was born. This past week she has been gravely sick (jaundice, puking, diarrhea, etc). She absolutely refuses to go to a hospital or doctor. Today, I called 911 because she couldn’t get out of bed. They couldn’t do anything because she was denying symptoms and her drinking and she was unwilling to go. They strongly recommended she needed emergency care. 

My question is—can I do anything to help her? Get her to the hospital? Would that even help? We’ve put her through every treatment imaginable, nothing ever stuck. What can I say to her? Any advice helps.

alcoholism,Pumpkin1390_,2020/03/16,"[SERIOUS] Seeking resources in DFW Texas. Hello lovely people. I have never been on this subreddit before so please let me know if I have broken any rules. 


I have a family friend who I’ve known for a couple years now. He is in his mid twenties, has alcohol related seizures multiple times a week, and is basically a dead man walking. I know there’s nothing I can do to help him as he needs to help himself as is extremely resistant to opening up and being honest about his feelings and struggles. All his “friends” and even some of his family members enable his alcoholism even though he likely has irreversible brain damage, and at the rate he’s going, will die within the next couple of years, if not much sooner. Basically everyone talks about his issues and how they feel helpless behind his back but no one will actually confront him with his own reality. What little friends he has maintained, want to help him but are just shut out. I know this is pretty common with those struggling with addiction and mental health. 

It’s a vicious cycle. 

I just want to get a packet together of available resources for him because that’s honestly all anyone else can do for him at this point. He went to rehab about five hours from here, where his dad lives, then stayed with him instead of living in a half way house. However the moment he moved back home, he immediately relapsed. He has been to MHMR (country services) and should be following their crisis program. However, the only reason he is following their program is because a Mental Health Deputy will be knocking on his door if he doesn’t appear for his counseling, case worker, or psych appointments. I’m looking for groups, medical facilities, and any form of assistance where a team of people can teach him the skills he needs to figure this out. It’s really quite dire at these point.

Thank you so much in advance. I wish all you lovely people joy, healing, and strength. You all are doing such great things to improve your health and spirit. I wish for each and every one of you that you reach the light at the end of the tunnel.",6.485552699228791,7.434440763496145,6.4948524421593845,76.21177994858614,65.52956298200513,9.308832904884321,31.241233933161954,9.3871,2.8402052647814915,1663,61,287,30,25,528,222,389,0.084,0.752,0.163,0.9876,2,0,2,0,0,0,42.0,0,6,3,7,20,19,2,2,17,0,32,12,1,2,5,52,54,25,2,10,9,1,2,1,3,4,9,0,2,1,13,20,2,0,8,1,0,8,4,7,0,4,3,4,38,12,48,43,10,46,1,2,1,2,55,22,0,6,15,201,51,7,0.0,0.0,0.09029790166600993,0.10087355786115956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.197777172921318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12584989059909765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06470053846366974,0.09480998737116456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14230282036606778,0.0,0.11281331864591525,0.0,0.07873793201465347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10329633426606467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20476983586448955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09603362576461516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729862759156432,0.0,0.08195590299185951,0.0,0.0,0.12223305040031993,0.0,0.07796221604000536,0.08841830857354993,0.0,0.0,0.17446190286739294,0.0,0.09357393715586476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144700227185488,0.0,0.048344160287910116,0.0,0.0525880782318014,0.0,0.0,0.10201687651406688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2950716244320841,0.0,0.0,0.18606678352679776,0.0,0.0928171586557248,0.0,0.09112539857648126,0.10676952518790718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657938622120933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15255953151792082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09462025764320288,0.0,0.04520647002307386,0.0927413910714867,0.1634149343220732,0.0,0.07770359033754619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1670275178762121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932162732751212,0.18650102076648686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834689126022927,0.13604336020402635,0.13722263775927127,0.0713663967012065,0.0,0.0984088508981206,0.0,0.0,0.08878696687536855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254041802913815,0.07037476934304301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19245015124517934,0.0,0.0,0.10157236892283916,0.17494533200677773,0.0,0.0,0.09413832816911934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09841919113649557,0.0,0.0,0.05927838014989983,0.09513832569202407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09862681941351584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19346911214176435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07437373101956535,0.0,0.08519105010766874,0.0,0.0,0.061474161144495325,0.0,0.09091223787637498,0.0,0.05395616381981848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10915556327914852,0.07344760887917648,0.07422360339602299,0.0,0.0,0.08577810772659214,0.0,0.0,0.21281450821622067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11917517162398322
alcoholism,hetlot,2020/03/16,"I want to get out So, long story short in advance: I'm one of those worst case scenario alcoholics to be cured. I'm a functional one. 

I'm quite a talented bartender and whatever happens (competitions etc.) I stand and deliver. I could do better and I know that, but I get so bored so easily and alcohol just takes the edge off. I just get away with it. And when people start to notice, I just flee.

I have so many things that trigger me to start drinking.

I hate noice. My bf is a really 'sound triggering' person. He eats chips super loud all the time. Scratches his head. Can't communicate with him about it bc of his autism. Result: drink and try to sleep.
My mom is extremely judgemental. Try to make her happy but always get some kind of comment. Result: drink and try to go to sleep.
My ex tried to kill me last year. People tell me to get over it. Result: drink and try to go to sleep.

I know I'm being difficult, but it feels like everytime I want to talk about it to people, it's just a burden to then, and in self defense I just start drinking, numb myself out and 1. Walk away from it all or 2. Give them a proper reason to hate me and be self destructive.

I've studied psychology myself so every time I seek help, it's like I already know what they'll try to do to help me.",0.7879262086513991,3.0964236450381684,2.7236335877862596,91.09051399491095,85.45038167938931,6.088753180661577,19.03867684478372,7.42949916751922,0.518915623409669,993,27,213,17,30,331,142,262,0.133,0.738,0.129,-0.7389,0,0,7,0,0,1,38.0,0,0,2,4,13,17,5,0,7,0,11,13,4,7,2,42,37,22,1,3,9,2,2,2,1,1,3,2,0,3,13,15,8,1,5,5,0,5,1,10,0,2,0,4,30,7,34,32,5,25,0,0,0,0,19,9,0,2,12,128,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19673419179624785,0.0,0.0,0.10157289678839958,0.0,0.07658802218508601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17295682770460435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08140548137735007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0734896833592757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4508406319640216,0.0,0.09418404085317174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265344527605844,0.0,0.0,0.07755108103085688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046540236741263605,0.06575628692994973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.240446082877674,0.08829703885556138,0.10462150829880876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139424846772426,0.09798260161291854,0.0,0.1817488847133866,0.09446374888664262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233903715532593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10183310265444502,0.09584971281607946,0.15175500635724395,0.07502818481421414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899361459422713,0.0,0.0,0.0814560868247951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061440117378725685,0.09331821870628053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10780087763103544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10479275974370042,0.0,0.0,0.12474285931527047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914352622552074,0.08036931320053284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09790017593780592,0.0,0.0,0.05896577465196566,0.09463661219040054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920440341409209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763315660529571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19544775469205156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06920566975433366,0.07398151994429979,0.08045055574980751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061149976159918074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10734325023182456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3749512036640599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10857992964805276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059273349712989774

alcoholism,mothybot,2020/03/17,"I always fuck up my relationships with drinking Okay so this happened like two days ago and I'm really fucking depressed about it. I have this female friend who I met a few months ago. We became fast friends, super close and sharing deeply personal thoughts together. I always had a small crush on her, however, and I fucked it up so badly that she blocked me and texted me telling me to never speak to her again. Yep, it was that bad.

I expressed my feelings for her one time and she said she saw me as a wonderful friend but didn't have romantic feelings for me. I decided to continue trying to be friends because I genuinely did like spending time with her. We were able to go back to our normal friendship and it didn't seem like she minded at all.

But then I guess two nights ago I got really drunk, and on Instagram I saw her hanging out with another guy friend. I guess I got jealous and started posting to my Story about how annoyed I was, she demands my attention all the time but doesn't like me, yada yada. I also tried facetime calling her a bunch even though she was declining them.

Anyway I deleted the message threads out of embarrassment without reading them, but she wants nothing to do with me ever again and I'm really sad about it. A really great friendship that meant a lot to me, gone after one night. She was who I would always confide in when I was sad, or happy, or whatever — now i feel so alone. I would pay so much money to be able to take that night back.

This isn't even the first time I've done this with a girl I liked before. I've been blocked in the past by another girl for drunkenly harassing her online too. 

TL;DR got drunk, posted a bunch of videos on instagram complaining about how a friend of mine I'm attracted to doesn't like me back",4.443418803418805,5.627995586894588,5.114659829059832,83.39978461538466,70.33903133903134,8.465002849002849,29.424615384615393,8.841846274778883,2.2747956923076917,1405,54,276,25,25,453,177,351,0.151,0.6709999999999999,0.17800000000000002,0.9195,1,1,1,0,0,0,30.0,3,0,2,2,24,31,6,1,13,2,22,6,0,2,4,51,50,26,0,4,7,0,3,6,6,2,0,2,0,4,15,19,3,2,9,5,3,3,7,13,0,5,22,7,55,18,41,24,7,45,0,3,2,3,42,12,3,7,34,195,70,2,0.16598509732150754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207036607117403,0.0,0.0,0.08595525116944461,0.0,0.06636911117962283,0.20716934664061054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17404984704884416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19144844128745286,0.1385906230613119,0.05059148735460872,0.0,0.07062054622025989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08474467130584287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053523328083939385,0.0,0.07148136055133439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493019167739534,0.0,0.0813011020942769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096315913381198,0.07507151167673197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12589057874985118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07059341949407402,0.0,0.0,0.38471902334028096,0.230175821738263,0.0,0.0,0.047166577967940784,0.0,0.19913016803282774,0.09149957788791582,0.1828512980249785,0.08217567124405935,0.07339003669360357,0.08834711128954398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2432758029605204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055729702974735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08379881563117378,0.0,0.06624386054591395,0.0,0.0610090725106923,0.0,0.06400896985550754,0.0,0.0,0.23364865454606246,0.08131507670099256,0.07963358876140841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11247579767313616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07922577849931252,0.0,0.07246589231873933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15896784071524628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08301500762307518,0.0,0.2126686072709684,0.0,0.0,0.08910293816735589,0.0,0.0,0.078944918878789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07555329931861131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058742553102385214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06240006804276797,0.0,0.07253914557415474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08153975768300545,0.06588681327899422,0.19357449012992975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126929855333612,0.0,0.16214332150516458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04895115546290321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08000185531296124,0.09000187879748417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11791105079210285,0.0,0.0,0.0

Whats strange is that he barely gets drunk at home. It's very easy to tell when he's drunk, and the person he lives with is retired. He goes a week just being depressed but not drinking and staying home all day. Suddenly he will go out and binge for 7 days straight. We wont be able to contact him during these times.This cycle just kerps going, 5 days home, 5 days at bars binging, etc. Is this common?",2.6164270613107803,4.375209317829455,3.5278224101479942,90.65739957716706,75.97674418604652,6.8614517265680055,24.13037350246653,7.686295010490155,1.057505426356589,498,16,106,7,11,159,94,129,0.10800000000000001,0.8420000000000001,0.05,-0.5147,3,0,2,0,0,0,17.0,1,0,0,2,6,3,0,0,3,0,10,5,0,1,1,16,16,10,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,2,1,0,4,1,6,9,5,0,1,4,0,2,3,3,0,1,4,0,7,0,11,8,3,21,0,3,0,0,20,5,0,0,13,55,13,2,0.14685821317820535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15694676745293454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3788455928923779,0.0,0.1264887638169405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438651394089614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16378572790915713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13844485333814688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07672735503639297,0.0,0.16692581379604976,0.0,0.11745592883170075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09843596465507697,0.0,0.5892430476181405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16578504703504834,0.0,0.0,0.14573411598533206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12967849280354696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32062617564848817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11722082464976295,0.0,0.10795768440856147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12823092716186069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14500476840662896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565313151409414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283605513555189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12117340610831592,0.0,0.0,0.11780080026069405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14966106567674664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,savagebandits,2020/03/17,"Alcohol for me was a crutch out of heroin. It’s a socially acceptable vice, and now I find myself a 31 year old functioning alcoholic wanting out of this party. The hardest lesson of all my addictions has been to let the party go on without you. It’s the hardest thing to do and the absolute best thing for you, biologically and socially and personally. 

I learned this lesson once already kicking heroin, and I thought that was my lowest point but no. Heroin addicts hide you don’t normally see them in your day to day life. Alcoholics like me function directly under and around the umbrella of normality. Suffering in broad daylight in the presence of everyone is absolutely worse. And suffering in self enforced silence being able to throw up a facade good enough to keep them away another day or more... it is an affliction. 

I want out. My partner downplays the effects, but he’s just an addict at an earlier stage. Such denial I feel nostalgia for. I felt I had it under control. So wrong I was.

I feel too young to be feeling so old. I am aware of the biological affects alcohol is having on my body. I’m 30 pounds overweight (it’s like carrying a 3 year old child all day every day) I can’t breathe at night I must prop up my head to align my respiratory organs, I can’t run for any length of time I tire so easily (I used to run 8 minute miles five years ago). I’m irritable when I used to be jovial. I’m still quite positive for others, but at the end of the night I’m combative even in absence of drinking.

I will improve upon my situation, of that I have no doubt. All support will be taken to heart",3.3661872948898264,5.320822775316458,5.255457102672292,78.22915846225973,74.41139240506328,8.732114392873887,29.74167838724801,9.348350401419415,2.8973339428035634,1271,57,240,32,27,436,180,316,0.136,0.7390000000000001,0.125,-0.6990000000000001,1,0,5,0,0,0,34.0,0,4,2,6,11,10,0,1,18,0,24,15,4,5,4,42,42,15,0,5,6,0,4,2,1,3,10,0,0,4,12,11,6,2,11,1,0,4,6,4,0,1,8,5,34,6,46,26,6,48,0,2,1,0,13,23,0,2,22,164,46,3,0.09513286004366506,0.0,0.0,0.31112657875541444,0.0,0.0,0.08432954044039127,0.406672382545956,0.0,0.0,0.10498147668660808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06469360707446739,0.099755098542654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08468841477644065,0.0,0.0,0.08938045359327741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998360673847793,0.0,0.0,0.10567116134039513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10669959185025134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30676412291507565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931939853847154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08425947706984405,0.09829767504156547,0.0,0.06283435683946922,0.0,0.08015353763339718,0.090903524600875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14430609738207806,0.0,0.09134246446658016,0.0,0.08694971060283488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05406619670043488,0.07979292945665277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976337602355874,0.0,0.0,0.1127328971986055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455845709769304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09727979484311333,0.0671951524617555,0.09295422014192513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785514893486047,0.1864200084481453,0.0,0.0,0.29947780063881096,0.1013133911458274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306634394465792,0.0,0.0,0.08993130239908108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10118550679164436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758085725618901,0.0,0.09924432073138334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693332059966523,0.0,0.19395194090190854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597322491899595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795564220215488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12640409005943104,0.0,0.0,0.07552486443108496,0.055472735729655984,0.10934122801113644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16432849297374424,0.0,0.0,0.11222365132233222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09170468225806573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09694851181210384,0.0,0.10401284825118408,0.0,0.18378732844435544
alcoholism,bridgeeeeeeee,2020/03/17,"My drunken behavior is scaring my loved ones Hey guys thanks for reading this is my first post here. I have been drinking daily for the past year and I’m starting to think I have a problem. Every time I drink I blackout every time and the next day my family and friends tell me things I said and did that surprise me. This morning my boyfriend told me that last night I broke several plates and glasses and threatened to kill him if he touched me. He said I was talking about a time I was assaulted when I was 15 and that I said I was going to kill all men and chop their genitalia off. I do not say these things when I’m sober. When I drink I get very angry and I want to pick fights with everyone and hurt people. My dad passed away of complications from alcoholism a few years ago and even though I tried to change him I’m feeling like I am following in his footsteps now. I can never have 3 or 4
drinks I have to have 8 or 9. I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years back and I think drinking makes it worse. Until today I always thought I was just the funniest friend and that everyone was boring because they didn’t drink as me. But after last night I think I might have a problem. Sometimes I will go to the liquor store 2 or 3 times a day because I always feel like I haven’t had enough. I’m ashamed of the way I’ve acted and the trouble I’ve caused. I don’t know what I am trying to say but I can’t stop how can I get help ??? I don’t want to hurt people anymore",3.49950076804916,4.10208317741936,4.365207373271891,90.05876344086023,72.06451612903227,7.453149001536099,27.019969278033795,7.447530270364453,1.1895130568356378,1155,38,260,12,21,373,164,310,0.132,0.7859999999999999,0.08199999999999999,-0.9233,0,0,7,0,1,0,17.0,0,0,2,1,11,20,4,2,12,0,30,11,0,4,2,43,56,27,2,5,8,1,3,2,2,2,3,5,0,2,11,16,8,1,7,8,1,5,7,13,0,2,16,8,49,7,23,38,4,38,0,3,0,1,24,3,0,5,30,163,60,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07550132491961913,0.09102475695376684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417426435398123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08446940000114128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800234725929649,0.06549329958725826,0.0,0.10384216499016842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08749682768873876,0.09010245585745452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985994989153122,0.0,0.0,0.08644948851288134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5006266606700592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08800717593619957,0.0,0.056256409878166366,0.0,0.14352499152046752,0.16277419540974813,0.0,0.0,0.08029416171558801,0.0,0.08613273980014052,0.12169618267839875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244868551641838,0.0,0.0,0.13160994199326367,0.0,0.08899946086481131,0.0,0.09681232609427066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843353304844683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05709011981355355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18236036408205453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884641065050622,0.0,0.04680922498885093,0.13885582826332873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322311186488816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07687256822768743,0.0,0.05685409028849935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09035581062822794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06569118992289151,0.0,0.09058317097761874,0.15985945069533414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0577158873463651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08130791159326034,0.1180974055064634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08157283767908255,0.0,0.0,0.16299941045063965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08519672546719627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2430590120987975,0.13546705196721484,0.08527370860499045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622201045159867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423894370716431,0.0,0.06028636644387893,0.0,0.0,0.07120900717876434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06845937465689253,0.0744455472336595,0.07841647765661712,0.0,0.0,0.11317121171188987,0.16372755775676848,0.0836827044758318,0.06761838495909006,0.198661822304862,0.0,0.08073468599864944,0.08138709770487408,0.0,0.11565467046823162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07027720302412198,0.10047528206492068,0.06760689970750153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679925270046002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645471649498017

alcoholism,al-key-hole,2020/03/18,Hiding alcohol Hi. I’m still fairly new to recovery. I seem to do well until number of days hit the 50s. Anyway. I’m now hiding alcohol and drinking at home alone. I think my bf is onto me. I feel like such a looser. I know I’m an alcoholic. I’m not real sure why I’m doing this... 😞,-1.8561904761904768,0.03859988888889277,2.498730158730158,89.6157142857143,97.7301587301587,5.339682539682539,14.936507936507935,6.937597516519254,0.06190793650793625,215,5,48,4,9,82,48,63,0.141,0.759,0.1,-0.3532,0,1,4,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,0,3,0,3,4,0,0,1,8,13,2,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,1,4,0,4,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,6,3,6,12,0,7,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,6,26,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6889397292412061,0.0,0.2225559204473912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385829647992849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21050536603412534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086522473346676,0.15351379476305366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2155470462328586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11809510536490415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049818937059957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20753714742340135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24458602745877275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1956231160274724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171607335541518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025264478392282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13768954865221072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1932073056452029,0.0,0.1939001728544835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,pitchpines,2020/03/18,"Drinking after recovering from a hangover. Is this a red flag? This is a much lighter situation than other posts I've read here but I figured I'd ask.

My boyfriend drinks everyday and gets hangovers every few months. Recently we had plans to hang out for the day. He was able to drive over but when we were getting lunch he started having a bad headache and was unable to eat anything. We go back to my place, I give him ibuprofen and an ice pack, and we end up napping together for a few hours until the hangover passes. He apologizes a lot for messing up our day, we hang out for a bit, and then he suggests we get dinner. He orders a margarita. Am I being ridiculous to find this concerning? I can see a college student doing this, but he's 30.

He gives a lot of external reasons for why he drinks a lot. For example, he's said he drinks so much because he had to stop smoking pot for his job, and recently he said that it's because he inherited a high tolerance from his mom (This one I especially don't get. I can eat a dozen cupcakes without getting sick but that doesn't mean I don't stop at two). He never brings up internal reasons (He drinks because he chooses to).

He's not aggressive or mean when he's drunk but I do worry about the future.",3.2614285714285742,4.810417365079367,4.635904761904765,84.26742857142861,73.76190476190476,7.5796825396825405,30.06031746031745,8.238735603445708,2.1685850793650787,984,44,197,16,20,327,142,252,0.086,0.868,0.046,-0.892,1,0,5,0,0,0,27.0,7,0,0,1,6,4,2,0,17,0,17,12,0,2,1,35,33,17,0,0,8,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,9,14,10,2,7,9,1,6,6,4,0,3,7,4,20,0,29,25,8,36,0,0,2,0,36,9,0,4,19,122,29,4,0.1028120179448744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08460553061697312,0.0,0.09611535817621414,0.0,0.0,0.07905609559247817,0.08584374052311163,0.1880197556176368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11224409551661264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326104922968249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5035831832097724,0.0,0.21040472281204892,0.0,0.0,0.09106093167549424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08662355936453056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09396832180486496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2685751798332203,0.19725331189061496,0.058430439101955424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10862654173024132,0.0,0.0,0.10124912777178917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10202506365567007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2622213031925341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22398485583565667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204121928268795,0.08206357183973251,0.0,0.15115732578376925,0.0,0.07929496639894608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06966808415538488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10741667632983733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09846549332447864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283984033705867,0.0,0.0,0.21141575552947875,0.20302892877260156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1955955455615717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08192786718522888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11556501582472806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07277087547193438,0.0,0.0,0.17191090123866906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043240236164544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927718548088285,0.0,0.0,0.0991071164434428,0.0,0.0,0.10441059483713323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Due to coronavirus I now take my classes online and don’t have a job as I mentioned, so I’m just in my apartment all day long. Everyone else all over social media has been joking about how they are all drinking during quarantine because how else can people cope. Everyone is just drinking to make the day get by faster. I had a serious problem and went to detox and was able to develop a healthy relationship with alcohol that was based off drinking moderately if I was going out with friends on the weekend. I was just wondering what advice y’all have for not falling into a relapse during this isolating and stressful time when everyone else is drinking?

alcoholism,Kovacs12,2020/03/18,"Sometimes it feels right Hey guys..... so ive had about 800ml, about 27 oz for the imperial friends. 

My high-school friend died last week. Age 24. he had cancer (non hodgkin) and died in his sleep due too congestive hear failure about 4 months after recovery. Coroners say it was likely caused by the chemo. .... i recently talked to a couple of my close friends that knew him in early middle school and early high-school. This brings me to my main question....

I did not cry when i initially heard the news. I felt a sinking feeling.... but i was just in shock. I was numb.

I had an assignment due so I drank a couple Nütrl’s (vodka soda pre mix) and helped my group complete the work i had forgotten about.... work was done. And still, no emotion....

Its been 4 days. I seem to have accepted the reality that life presented to me. Unfortunately whatever god or force controls this world has presented me with some kind of critical lesson.... and I cant stop drinking...

To be honest I dont know why im posting this.. maybe its cathartic... time for another drink",1.4862801377726775,4.154666562189057,2.629975124378109,89.9763289322618,87.35820895522389,6.0773823191733625,22.65614236509759,7.468242284971852,1.1619129735935716,813,30,162,15,26,259,138,201,0.134,0.775,0.092,-0.8635,0,0,3,0,0,0,57.0,0,0,0,4,10,9,0,0,9,0,17,9,1,2,0,25,27,10,2,0,4,0,3,1,3,0,4,3,0,1,9,7,4,2,9,3,0,1,4,2,0,0,15,6,22,7,19,11,2,26,0,0,0,0,15,7,0,4,18,92,31,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296783140950072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12704270200663784,0.0,0.0,0.12966517823584334,0.0,0.1387059246886474,0.0,0.2736760265121678,0.13584520195278285,0.07975663372724931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25669895177538865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12655689458204072,0.14493980046891095,0.2422981699189469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13911160683695015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12506208835789462,0.0,0.1187421692761337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.286640380287405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12245230532796322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13938457944921584,0.0,0.08289309761946961,0.26132735507668586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335843440147939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12878281346015658,0.06796555462073775,0.1008071954031162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08735146587892485,0.060418699054599276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12424269293139213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09871186100299344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11844125076129268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385382076241759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221087685272086,0.0,0.0,0.1056131264747076,0.0,0.098346995939166,0.0,0.37548058409301577,0.0,0.11258412053879524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12375887027933792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12231235469261023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09876266845291684,0.10339328771304276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09940090588239406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07211271356304423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09920025947709063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11159254016829324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18006582166585428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,FormalDisaster2,2020/03/18,"Coronavirus is making me realize I might have a problem I've been drinking every day for the past month. I kept telling myself it was because my birthday was coming up and I was celebrating (and depressed). Then it was because I was on a mini vacation (and depressed). Lately, it's been because of social distancing and being bored (and depressed). I stocked up on wine and already went through it in two days. I would probably be drinking even if we weren't being asked to stay inside but the isolation makes it feel like the weekend, which is when I drink the most. I tell myself to not drink during the week because of work (mostly successful) and then go wild on the weekend. But, like I said, it's been a month now. 

I keep thinking it's not that bad and that I don't have a problem. But it's been building up for a while. I've wondered if I might have a problem since I can't just have one drink and because I think it'll make me feel better when I'm depressed. 

I guess my question is: what are y'all doing to distract yourself and keep yourself from giving in?",4.7739034205231405,5.470241873239439,5.356716968477532,83.75588028169015,69.23474178403757,7.588061703554661,32.11569416498995,7.447530270364453,2.0699553319919515,841,36,164,8,14,271,112,213,0.102,0.8029999999999999,0.094,-0.184,0,1,6,0,0,0,25.0,1,1,0,3,5,14,0,1,12,0,28,6,0,3,0,42,47,20,0,6,8,0,2,2,0,4,0,1,0,0,13,12,6,3,7,8,0,3,5,10,0,2,13,3,23,4,17,27,2,27,0,4,0,0,9,8,0,9,17,121,36,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.111547329753298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944987273918968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439987519082848,0.3080955351905995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939947921188261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08707383985382129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13038002457305609,0.0,0.3482497026561026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4951130688400284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06676420396649622,0.0,0.0851665777190052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102220952610799,0.07221353779845421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969677859043392,0.057447657074340026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11135404683880988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17969398783489762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402574643553005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09876785289546866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20242056444260345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21446565052429345,0.0,0.0,0.1613665755658047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06849628839176175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964949239643732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10898430257883478,0.2901676247021431,0.0,0.0,0.11323581544400114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09615284429989486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361669651957514,0.0,0.0,0.10304113540268578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10774076350586648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17670156025489606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295394911108214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09874316022093453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108248595663667,0.0,0.0,0.09370472325385563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10961993199333887,0.0735894469099834,0.0,0.0,0.07180628638973892,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Zomodee,2020/03/19,"He showed up with alcohol on his breath at our house closing He’s had real issues with drinking since we met and at every major milestone of our short (1.3 year) marriage. He has lessened his drinking a lot but still drinks at super inappropriate times. He “sells real estate” but hasn’t actively sought new business for almost a year. He’s making several thousand off our sale and keeps saying he’s “flush with cash”. Needless to say, I pay the bills. I am done with it. I want to cancel the purchase and file for divorce. I don’t care so much about the money but the fact that he provides zero support in other ways. Nothing around the house, pretty much dead bedroom except for the occasional blow job from me. He’s been taking to passing out at 6 right after dinner (usually no drinking...at least not in front of me) and he’s not awake when I leave for work. I co-signed his car loan, this house is solely in my name, etc. I know it sounds like all I care about is the money but honestly if he were just PRESENT, someone I could talk to or trust, I’d be happy. I told him he needs to get 100% sober or I’m gone. I don’t think he will. I don’t know what to do. I am alone in this town, I moved here to be with him and all my friends are his friends really. Thanks for letting me put this somewhere.",2.8402882205513755,4.2554222518797005,3.856015037593988,89.97758145363413,74.6015037593985,6.26967418546366,23.94486215538847,6.655083550727371,0.6322651629072675,1013,30,216,8,21,327,163,266,0.053,0.75,0.19699999999999998,0.9925,4,1,5,0,1,0,34.0,4,0,0,2,8,11,0,0,9,0,20,6,1,1,3,41,37,14,1,4,11,0,0,1,2,1,1,3,1,0,8,14,5,1,3,4,9,6,7,0,0,2,7,3,29,11,37,25,8,33,0,0,0,0,32,17,0,5,10,132,37,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12494128437230805,0.11706852327323837,0.12108354925031292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040747271538906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383951667306809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09334315853475617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11963956718055695,0.0,0.343582010369479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13038560487051845,0.0,0.0,0.09850175589702442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18064882279394925,0.0,0.06108067365969678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12445291771485255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4046954887186802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202371365847788,0.1160151809659323,0.10391502042194957,0.0,0.0,0.12850140744786356,0.0,0.0,0.12379085805133433,0.0,0.1195484427546512,0.0,0.05711634303588822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09939274021814916,0.0,0.0,0.07803836340999226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12425687683345694,0.17188467104823782,0.08668731761789346,0.0,0.112912450771001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112178342051065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11893954652482365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11752688682608865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.266138454031766,0.07489556900871347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984054034945088,0.0,0.18594312173237398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13207507466144225,0.0,0.09670919802204037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09905750244061848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09336451361521143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13266813455620236,0.0,0.0,0.08790180482615176,0.09396786636081457,0.0,0.10763506283621777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07491123674431438,0.0,0.0,0.06817118788660917,0.0,0.0,0.11171255885633748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12875989855006773,0.0,0.06895657406279745,0.09279775266167854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08511190575298477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15057247293057807
alcoholism,jaymason2020,2020/03/19,"Immune System does anyone know how quickly your immune system bounces back after a lot of drinking?

i started drinking last year in september for about 2 and a half months until mid november. about 6 drinks per night mostly vodka. then took a month off until mid december and started again. mix of vodka and beer about 6 drinks per night again. just stopped a couple weeks ago in early march now.

alcoholism,SoftDarkie,2020/03/19,"How to help an alcoholic mother? My mother is a secret binge-drinker and has narcissistic tendencies. I've known this for a while. I've tried to intervene. I've tried to plead. I cried. I told her she's not going to live to see my wedding or meet her future grandkids. I tried to distract her with hobbies and other things. 

One time she actually admitted that she drinks because she's lonely (she self-isolates. I tried to get her out).

 I spend as much time I can with her, I don't go out, I don't have a life because I'm trying to be there for her. I don't allow liquor in the house and she finds a way to get it and a new hiding spot each time. Every time I step outside for more than an hour, she drinks herself to oblivion. Then she yells at me for being a bad daughter, as I'm trying to carry her to bed. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Yes I know I'm a doormat who lets herself be abused. Please if anyone has advice on how to help her, I would really appreciate it. I can't have her death on my conscience.

I live in a very small country, in a region where alcoholism is totally normalised (we're The Drinkers of our country). Any kind of therapy, especially psychotherapy, is out of the question (stigma and embarrassment; I know she won't do it. I tried to convince her). So if there's anything I can do by myself... Please tell me. Before she completely destroys her mind and body. I'm putting my life on hold because of her right now, but I DO NOT WANT to devote my entire life to a person who is destroying herself. I want to live.",1.8800282823887748,3.7691326908517335,3.637141303165453,88.45545741324922,78.55835962145109,6.391341237898401,24.180245839225503,7.372421405659032,1.0276216469052537,1201,42,254,16,29,402,160,317,0.091,0.85,0.059000000000000004,-0.8863,0,2,6,0,1,0,46.0,1,0,0,0,7,9,2,2,15,1,25,9,1,3,1,35,41,17,1,5,6,4,0,0,0,2,5,1,1,1,10,12,5,1,8,3,1,4,8,6,0,1,1,2,54,3,42,34,4,28,0,1,1,0,42,13,0,4,10,172,64,0,0.0,0.1184009092098103,0.09751742955305874,0.0,0.0,0.09765060430732728,0.0,0.21358991927514173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679559414688886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910387531508157,0.06987349744862219,0.0,0.0822340142395928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0834375167802715,0.18274950996742131,0.0,0.08503321336073509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11099988978403233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477488063307146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1097685979599713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29368056454633784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419547708430727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091334363806019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10441877736241256,0.0,0.11358523553002607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13396217128685736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09841108677192452,0.11530599780088277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10406189303451006,0.16475702195687447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10218536797391158,0.21175090032132185,0.0,0.0,0.2647205093083975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009009835001568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07346017210858052,0.0,0.0,0.0965131796367294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06771526852559838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08725516882433343,0.0,0.21938663353677346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045742044335312,0.11194465903977162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06401782492874099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533981806238017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0796314064529723,0.0,0.10424895991621468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734337204606547,0.0,0.11427885691134625,0.0,0.06638916373621866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2330803399491641,0.0,0.0,0.09548755860810214,0.0,0.4749221747209597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08245285471308138,0.11788280520371892,0.07931991654919922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07098752470932429,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ronaldburgandy32,2020/03/19,"Need to stop drinking I'm going down a dark road. I know I've had a drink to some extent every day/evening for at least 30 days straight. I bet in the last 90 days 75 of them I have drank alcohol of some sort. Over this time frame I've had several bouts of performance anxiety in the bedroom, and several panic attacks. Over the last few weeks my anxiety is become unbearable. I drink to make it go away, which is only temporary and then the next day the anxiety is worse. I have a prescription for Xanax, and unfortunately I have taken it daily for about 3-4 months. (about 2mg per day) I am splitting the Xanax into 3, .5mg doses per day to slowly taper off of it. (1.5mg per day for now) Right now mentally I am in the worst place I've ever been. All I do is constantly obsess over the bad things in life, not being able to perform in the bedroom, doom and gloom 24-7, etc. I've never had any experience with alcoholism so if you have any advice or have experienced this stuff I could desperately use any and all tips/resources to taper off of alcohol. I am not sure I could stop cold turkey.

alcoholism,AkiraPierrot21,2020/03/19,"My roomate friend has an issue My friend has a problem drinking is there any helpful steps to help them reign this in or best practice to show support, he understands it’s an issue but either after the fact but nothing happens beyond that.  He is an active on Reddit so another subreddit to join with resources was a suggestion. His major issue is he drinks every night and apparently can’t sleep without liquor people have suggested melatonin as a sleep aid he heard it from at least a couple different people. But possibly he might need therapy of sort to get to part of the issue. Is there any suggestions going forward to help my friend because I don’t want to care more about the drinking then he does.


First time I don’t know his Reddit or haven’t seen if he joined this sub yet but I hope he did and if so don’t be embarrassed bro we just want to help.",4.81397435897436,6.070024278106513,5.403091715976332,81.40905571992114,69.53254437869822,8.236883629191325,28.87623274161736,8.59863814320734,2.1811534516765287,689,25,128,11,12,222,108,169,0.03,0.7490000000000001,0.222,0.9858,2,0,3,0,0,0,7.0,1,0,1,2,8,9,0,1,10,0,16,6,2,0,1,25,29,14,0,7,11,1,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,5,4,4,0,2,5,0,3,6,2,0,1,4,2,10,7,20,23,6,13,0,0,1,0,24,5,0,7,7,84,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16212540903253966,0.12499562851467601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07266555951189035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12509708449496587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12153626785908613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318967908474861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245426502248322,0.0,0.0,0.10431609094548916,0.0,0.0,0.35032316985690115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043438341026037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10139473246633413,0.0,0.0,0.27628979248959395,0.0,0.0622790907779167,0.0,0.06774629404109413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10541156937251132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31959930721748697,0.0,0.0,0.11839631808530166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4976713899610638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06551131757422145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12645644541544807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838814308594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11186473653683657,0.0,0.11437930738678675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12908615137571516,0.0,0.16528187849015386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13438442824783234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11406198398911856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23857987178177986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13527111441821665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363199892463067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950872255408626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12409541002694716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14061903638187276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11490825595931105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

A year and a half ago he was in rehab and I supported him through it all. He’s slipped further and further and now I suspect he’s using again, all the usual signs. Avoiding, losing contact. We don’t live together and we kind of broke up a month ago because of these patterns. He asked me to be patient with him but now he’s not responsive and I can tell he’s using again. Not sure what to do and looking for suggestions. Do I need to let him struggle through it on his own? I often try to help him avoid the rapid decline into a full on relapse. If we “kind of broke up” do I just wash my hands of him and his addiction. Feeling torn because I do care but also don’t see a future as he’s hiding his behaviours again and not dealing with things. I realize stressful time in the world so I’m trying to reach out to him but he keeps isolating away from me.

alcoholism,Damienn93,2020/03/19,"How do I maintain a healthy approach to alcohol? I AM WRITING THIS DRUNK, AND I THINK I NEED HELP TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDUSTRY THAT IS MY CAREER (craft beer).

I'm a 26 year old male that works as a retail manager and brews beer with a local brewpub as a resume builder / passion. I've loved alcohol of all styles since I turned 21 and got into craft beer.

While I don't drink on the clock and don't drink and drive, I feel that I drink too much at the end of the day. I have 2-5 drinks every night, be it beer, mix drinks, or neat liquor.

I have a history of addiction in my family and have lost multiple relatives to addiction related suicide. I almost lost my father to alcoholism.

I drink flavored seltzer to curb my cravings, but it doesn't seem to be enough.

I only think about these things when I'm drunk. I'm writing this drunk. When I'm sober, I'll tell myself I don't have a problem, and that I only drink socially. The problem is that I'm drinking liquor after my fiance has gone to bed and even when she's around I mix myself strong beverages.

I truly love beer and genuinely wish to open a brewery someday that works with local animal organizations to find homes for less adoptable dogs (I have a sound business plan).

Please help me rediscover a healthy relationship with alcohol. I want to make my fiance proud and be a good dad to my dog.

I'm tired of getting drunk at night, being ashamed of myself and thinking of all the people I've lost to this, and then doing it all again the next day.

TL;DR: I think I have a serious drinking problem but brewing beer is my career.

alcoholism,LKamz,2020/03/19,"He took my baby so I'm gonna blow his mind When my partner and I fell pregnant we were on the verge of breaking up.
Basically, he felt obligated to stay because he is a good, moral man. I went to rehab for my entire pregnancy bar 6 weeks at the end and I gave birth to a healthy beautiful boy. We doted on him for 3 months putting our relationship issues aside. 
One day while he was at work i found an old stash and i panicked. I didn't know whether to tell him or not. He has never been understanding or empathetic. He refuses to educate himself or even ask me how I'm going in terms of my recovery. It's hard. However, I love and respect him so I wanted to tell him, to maintain honesty. I kept it in a drawer to decide later as I had my two kids to look after. But knowing it was there sent my anxiety sky high. He came home to me avoiding eye contact and minimal conversation, he immediately accused me of drinking. I was tired and spaced out and couldn't find my words. He locked my 3mo in the car, packed his items and left. 
I relapsed that night.
At the time I should have been strongest for my baby I was so weak.

I want to beat the stereotype. I want to beat the stigma.

We planned on starting a support groupchat/online meeting through group facetime and the free video app Zoom. I'd be interested to hear anyone's ideas and if anyone is interested. Thanks!

alcoholism,Initial-Cheetah,2020/03/20,"My friend is on house arrest. It will be revoked if she tests positive for drinking. She is currently begging me to go buy alcohol for her. I've known this person for an extremely long time and have kept in contact with her, but my life is not really tied to her.'s I'd be sad if she went back to jail, but I don't know what to tell her. She's been sober for more than a year, but went to jail for a few weeks back in January because she tested positive for marijuana use. 

That incident put her on house arrest, which has really been bringing out the boredom, so she's asking me to bring her wine.

super random but i though i'd share (also if anyone else has tried this i'd love to hear)

im a college student and i go to a crazy party school. ive started to realize i like the feeling of drinking especially after something really stressful. Sometimes in the middle of the school week i feel like i need something to drink but to combat this i start putting hot and cold cream on my stomach and chest area to mimic the burn feeling of digest alc. surprisingly it works really well and suppresses any cravings i have for a while.

alcoholism,starkslut,2020/03/20,"Resources for young people struggling? Hiya, I’m 26 years old and have begun to realize over the last few months that what I thought was a “drinking problem” might just be alcoholism. I decided to stop altogether (10 days sober today) but I need more community/resources than just myself. I can’t afford outpatient. I’m hesitant to do AA because I associate with the middle aged crowd, and I know that it is religious/Christian and I am not religious and wouldn’t really feel comfortable in that kind of environment. 

Anyone know of other resources? Maybe anything specific for the modern hip woman who also is an addict? 

Thank you in advance :) I am very new to all this and haven’t even told anyone in my life yet",4.8365823650034185,6.9956985639097775,5.716431989063565,75.61385509227615,70.8796992481203,9.046889952153112,30.13602187286397,9.573946990214177,3.1635924812030067,571,24,96,14,11,187,97,133,0.06,0.8440000000000001,0.096,0.8320000000000001,1,0,2,1,0,0,15.0,0,1,0,1,5,5,0,1,5,0,12,5,1,0,1,22,21,7,0,3,4,0,1,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,8,6,2,1,6,1,0,1,4,2,1,0,3,1,11,3,14,15,3,19,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,1,13,65,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21874501467672272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144405903326047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16046479239782568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2806071389948813,0.0,0.16512306029051846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12231823466014732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294067311853197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19656681003252685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13253161170641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10145786810003904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20895268699177608,0.22055093966840889,0.16356168794295678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14172949804143534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2015862507549613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21286465374403196,0.0,0.0,0.16016196602907418,0.0,0.0,0.1487841241405647,0.0,0.19379513121606093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21055506140987096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13910983231967314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19200100593872133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285455813281565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16775767436730296,0.0,0.20976956038961048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18473738709381535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15929871029844636,0.0,0.0,0.19019873609397664,0.19173571961477606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16556248440269394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12921609596575348

Does it ever fully heal? What did you do that worked? Will I be able to enjoy some wine again?",4.591180124223605,7.5290945362318835,5.355734989648036,74.22130434782609,74.65217391304348,9.160248447204973,30.146997929606627,9.606745405546679,3.6538389233954467,309,14,48,9,7,100,62,69,0.08199999999999999,0.8220000000000001,0.096,0.2523,0,0,4,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,0,1,5,2,0,1,2,0,8,8,0,1,1,11,11,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,3,3,5,0,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,5,1,5,6,3,8,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,3,7,35,8,1,0.21949741445909696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4691519652609364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23963432725740666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22278525529170687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841673331202589,0.0,0.0,0.21502390263148688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14497597212081492,0.1985479778423872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11467833963318845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2498992611807495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21672721641297146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15536139970114102,0.0,0.1752909187234039,0.0,0.2514335466585443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16503473888296535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21441707970479432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1760675859991479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597967319278117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,life_is_an_addiction,2020/03/21,"Want to start drinking.... I recently partied 3 weeks back to back as two of my closest friends were getting married to each other. 1st week: Bachelor Party, 2nd week: Destination Wedding, 3rd week: Saint Patrick's Day

Each week I reconnected with old friends, ate amazing food, traveled to new cities/countries, and drank. Drank a lot. 

I'm not one who drinks regularly, but when I do, I tend to binge. Last time I drank was New Years when I didn't pace myself and blacked out. This time around I was a bit more careful, but surprised myself at how well I could hold my alcohol.

On several occasions, I had 16+ shots over 2-3 hours and didn't lose my shit. No blacking out, puking, or passing out. In fact, what I remember most is that feeling of happiness. Whether it was cans of Whiteclaw, shots of ice cold Tito's, or crisp ginger beer + Jameson, I miss that feeling of warmth and joy that alcohol gave me.

Now, back home in the states I'm self-quarantined at my parent's house for 14 days and find myself craving some Jameson and Whiteclaw. This is the very first time I've wanted to drink by myself and I'm a bit concerned.

Looking inwards, I have a void. A sort of hollowness that I'm constantly looking to fill somehow. Whether it's reddit/youtube, swiping through dating apps, or chatting with randoms to pass the time, I've been distracting myself constantly to avoid the void.

I'm craving connection, but haven't been able to find it and I fear that the warmth of alcohol will be replacing it...",5.12392733564014,6.28140252595156,5.234427335640138,83.27136418685122,68.72318339100346,8.409757785467127,33.82716262975778,8.697196308434329,2.746610934256056,1186,56,228,19,20,372,170,289,0.062,0.774,0.16399999999999998,0.9794,1,2,7,0,0,0,52.0,0,0,0,2,10,14,1,3,10,0,18,13,1,1,1,43,39,20,0,3,9,1,2,0,2,1,3,0,1,0,14,16,12,2,5,6,0,4,5,6,1,3,14,7,23,8,33,22,8,45,1,2,4,0,7,11,1,9,29,134,37,0,0.10118920649680024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3244214644269653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900798471397431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23342476127724526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2209448114395915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031691399305798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2186991681976992,0.0,0.0807913475470237,0.0,0.0,0.13051733403249216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2973806977008376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11386598958288223,0.10232860640049564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849702030820668,0.08607148735364817,0.1223583901552411,0.0,0.15635705985749648,0.0,0.05286718396409778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10771779192149301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10150102457988476,0.0,0.09965098538590893,0.11675875837438135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08248270883837486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699468966088657,0.11320483887331435,0.0,0.08602744480331193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19545833236893206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061810503617047,0.0,0.06856842511947943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11235863887946572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991213385875937,0.0,0.11462764530395705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10556241092208553,0.11431500097887233,0.10386926634099514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07162224117642277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2360169602013085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09884715138060296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08349169275085996,0.11936803142750227,0.0,0.4058393890644421,0.0,0.09098124897578637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06516253136548596
alcoholism,pomonagod69,2020/03/21,"Has quitting alcohol made you less social? I’ve been sober no problem now for the last 3 months which is great. Used to drink 3-4x a week, heavily during the weekends. That was consistent since I was about 22, and I’m 27 now. Anyway, I quit because I’m a destructive person when I drink and my hangovers are awful. Since I’ve been sober, I don’t like going out in public anymore. I don’t like being around my “friends”, because they still drink a lot. I don’t have a problem with that, I just don’t like being sober around inebriated people. I find that I just don’t like being around people as much anymore now that I don’t drink. I’ve turned into a hermit. I’d rather stay home and away from everything. I don’t like going to restaurants.

alcoholism,PuzzleheadedRooster1,2020/03/21,"I don't want to lose my dad. Please help. My dad's been drinking my whole life. He's a successful person and that fuels him. He earns a lot of money and that's on top of all of his moral system. He loves us by giving my brother and I money (and he really does - he's a great father), he buys his ""friends"" with money (e.g. he buys them drinks all the time) and he feels superior to most people because of his money.

That's probably also the reason that he feels like alcohol and cigarettes won't kill him. It's not like he doesn't know the effect that they have on his body - he knows perfectly well. But he copes with EVERYTHING using alcohol. And most of the times he doesn't even need a reason to get drunk. Whenever he's drunk all he talks about is his money and how well he's doing at his job and how all of his colleagues suck at the job. While he drinks, he also smokes. A lot. Which also concerns me.

I've tried to talk a lot to him about it. I've told him that I'm worried. I've told him that this can't go on. He always says that periodically he checks his liver and lung function and I am not sure if he really does. Mum left our home for a few months because of his alcoholism. Back then he begged a lot for her to come back and promised that he will change. He said that he's consulted a specialist. And indeed, when she came back, there were a few sober months.

alcoholism,Brekmepleseinc,2020/03/21,"I don't know what to do anymore.. I'm 25yo male and I'm alcoholic.. I've been drinking since I was 16 doing immature stupid stuff using fake IDs and shit to get alcohol 

I regret it tho cause now I lost all my friends from acting stupid and wreckless, I got my license suspended for DWIs and I don't even like drunk drivers I said I was always so against that and now I'm one of those ppl 

I drink everyday I drink all day and I have no one that cares I tried to just drop it and go cold turkey but the shaking and cravings are way too bad it's embarrassing to go out like that

I've had job after job and I can't keep it cause I'm always drunk or hungover and have to call in ""sick"" or saying something ""came up"" it's gotten to the point that quite honestly I don't give a f*vk I'm not even making enough money to buy much anything so I just spend it all on alcohol and no food most of the time 

I drink whatever I can get, beer, wine, whiskey, vodka I went to my mother's house not to long ago drunk asking her for anything she could give me and wound up somehow taking  champaign she saves only for special occasions, I feel guilty for taking it but what can I do? 

I can't stop drinking and soon I'll have to move in with her or be homeless cause I can't keep up on my bills and she won't take me in unless I tell her I'll stop with the drinking so I'll probably lie and hide my drinking like I've done before and I quite frankly feel disgusting really

I'm like a failure and I can't remember when I was sober I can't help but destroy myself I don't know who I am anymore I black out and do things I never thought I would I've been hospitalized multiple times for alcohol poisoning I've tried going to AA once it just wasn't for me I'm drinking now writin this I'm afraid to stop and I don't want to

Alcohol is my only comfort, my only happiness, I know it's killing me but I love it it's like a toxic relationship I can't get enough and I'm a disappointment I tried to kill myself once and that didn't work either I'm just a lost cause its gotten so bad I've thrown up blood my whole body aches I can't picture my life without it and I'm always thinking about it

What else can I try I've tried everything and everyone I know says I don't care if I hurt them but I do I just can't help myself 
My own mother even told me I'm selfish and haven't tried but they don't know what it's like or how hard it is I'm not me and I don't know what do anymore I think I fear I'll just drink myself to death and I feel helpless to stop it",0.27006641604010184,2.1451024928571414,2.4437218045112807,95.04092731829573,83.89285714285714,5.644110275689224,20.181704260651628,6.8360192770164,0.17245238095238102,1996,58,474,24,57,674,227,560,0.21100000000000002,0.7,0.08900000000000001,-0.9968,3,0,19,0,0,1,18.0,0,0,2,5,23,37,8,4,9,0,46,29,3,7,4,91,100,45,3,5,23,2,4,6,1,2,9,3,0,1,32,31,21,6,13,16,4,8,27,22,1,2,19,9,76,15,43,77,10,39,0,6,1,1,26,12,1,7,23,283,108,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05103929127245007,0.30766606335142954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14372815464611133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17130527106076215,0.0,0.0,0.09476333160494987,0.0,0.05382751867851218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09615020188489816,0.0,0.0,0.04899451078516202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395601297700453,0.0,0.0,0.05879342393259459,0.06585372315807303,0.11740891385664785,0.2365932560031393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04597122924012774,0.0,0.0,0.03713295089629348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05892213264884474,0.0,0.507639368843451,0.0,0.0,0.048098906668113985,0.0,0.0,0.1189866241805842,0.0,0.11408888358333813,0.0,0.0,0.05501810451671972,0.051747260252903333,0.0,0.0,0.06479109049050034,0.08733927516041202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06962336653693801,0.0,0.04448450521163602,0.0,0.09024615285240692,0.1104678433463721,0.09816845960417538,0.0,0.04605026765112817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06129269353727669,0.05157844546751338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0771864402921456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664371100370278,0.0616382808437011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142742663359503,0.10235567984409387,0.12740272354895316,0.0,0.1898596882362363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04066893926709411,0.16877777912879904,0.0,0.0,0.05095458667469907,0.0,0.0,0.1257060529122097,0.0,0.051966258934016366,0.0,0.03843366295034193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0611961439835596,0.042326345817193904,0.0,0.04440758860957497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12263706533884572,0.07803248455454798,0.13137165178300572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05442968043804259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062078662270216876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1224822648556876,0.0,0.0,0.03688584601181418,0.0,0.0,0.06181706456098944,0.06522448157529698,0.0,0.05476972193583714,0.09157643697691137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05910283710995831,0.04762899372260608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04432624305488875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1925506479515844,0.0,0.0,0.06591286454391307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12987413594257194,0.0,0.050325580024468464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03825216606707728,0.07378712465042797,0.0,0.04571038255254322,0.06714821643281382,0.0,0.0,0.05501810451671972,0.0,0.23454948980028106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0497287769709728,0.0,0.0,0.03396090858307905,0.04570261846228668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05337524515324045,0.0,0.06428361493389421,0.0,0.055502994139110286,0.0,0.04191736161336049,0.0,0.0,0.040901653689462296,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,MinnieTyco,2020/03/21,"Could drinking really be a problem this young? I'm turning 22 soon and I drink a bit more than my friends and they think I might have a drinking problem.

I mean I go to parties like my friends and maybe I tend to be the one totally drunk in the group but that's not to say I'm an alcoholic. I know that I can get really crazy when I'm drinking sometimes(been in arguments while drunk and tried to start a fight once) but isn't that normal behavior? People get into arguments with their friends all of the time.

Sometimes I can start drinking a little early on in the day(about 12:00 o clock cause around lunch time) but it's usually just depending on the amount of stress during that day. I wouldn't say I always get ""drunk"" but I do love the feeling of a good buzz when I'm stressed out.

I've been having about 4 glasses of Vodka a day generally, I'll have two in the afternoon and 2(sometimes 3)when I come home. 

I go like actually real drinking only about 4 times a week? But it's not like I'm always alone, however I do enjoy some time alone to just kick back and relax and enjoy a glass or two when I come back home.

I love vodka, which I know people say is really strong but honestly I never felt that way I just love how it gets me warm inside. I'm kind of shy so before I go to a social event I usually will have a drink before I go, it's not like I'm drinking to get drunk or anything just to loosen up a little (I'm against drunk driving) one drink never hurt anybody and alcohol can actually have some health benefits.

I know when I start drinking it can be hard for me to stop sometimes but that's only because I like enjoying the moment and unwinding.  I've only blacked out a couple of times but I promised myself not to drink that much again. My memory can be kind of patchy but not a total blackout I still remember bits and pieces.

There have been times where I've had a drink the next morning to help get over my hangover but it's not all the time, and I had good reason. I can't just be so hungover I can't concentrate on anything for my classes and job.

I wouldn't say I can't stop drinking, I just like it. Does it really seem like I'm an alcoholic?",2.4309192982456156,4.096413720000001,3.8439766081871336,88.59526315789475,76.24444444444444,7.1368421052631605,24.508771929824558,7.94452939551167,1.256533333333333,1714,57,365,27,38,565,189,450,0.109,0.679,0.212,0.9953,2,2,18,0,1,0,36.0,0,0,2,1,23,32,1,2,27,0,32,26,0,4,6,75,69,32,0,6,24,0,4,7,3,4,4,4,2,0,17,19,22,2,10,22,0,7,14,6,0,4,5,9,43,26,38,54,12,60,0,1,1,3,16,16,0,7,43,223,60,2,0.0,0.0,0.10207943720695012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.167686475530162,0.0,0.10833928230354124,0.0,0.0,0.08703977951694902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608104142325247,0.046560335056251435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08043482488473977,0.0,0.031883133119244456,0.0,0.08901119116392961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11420161974307955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05372909944579398,0.0,0.09010798632786757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04175930944465199,0.05787174789321519,0.0,0.10119240312054864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045770291131523165,0.0,0.0,0.666075301450902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026445727602396663,0.0,0.05021862508177248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212264006856333,0.0,0.16395546020611704,0.0,0.11889891859398642,0.08773775115354056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046852788158031296,0.0,0.0,0.055595137136883216,0.0,0.0,0.03505727928498944,0.0,0.104927391931756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05599093358899547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05190218456588595,0.0,0.0,0.1089300602398768,0.08623229793039262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17886659894909318,0.1048417386417586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416152095588691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05254491520162432,0.056972781545035225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055484712566033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03844837307719206,0.0,0.08067786157083369,0.0,0.05562432753431397,0.0,0.05124536855157598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05570048099125653,0.07088308759871093,0.11933527881984388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0725199691504209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10009290353775167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05953172268589785,0.13402534439001665,0.0537757055494736,0.0,0.0,0.059248563818961736,0.0,0.0,0.1663722651218315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04761425341953236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05331583651106027,0.0,0.0,0.15518560054835218,0.0,0.11105998686300847,0.0,0.04176886315407157,0.0874545038765219,0.11982472884742115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03351334543626583,0.0,0.0,0.2134861560715776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0355099805050299,0.05689012696301837,0.10218393200639274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11520768167732799,0.0,0.0,0.041515308995296096,0.04195392983860407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,HFApartner,2020/03/22,"Husband of 15 years has been slowly sliding into functional alcoholism for 12 years. How to respond? This is a LONG story, but I’m going to give the key points below:
- husband had gastric bypass 12 years ago, and that changed something significant about his relationship with alcohol
- began with binge drinking and during a couple of those binges over the first few years, he got extremely irrationally angry with me and also got physically intimidating with me (like visibly holding himself back from hitting me or crowding my space). 
- since that time he has not continued the physically intimidating or irrational behavior, but the drinking has gotten progressively worse.
- he now routinely drinks 6-12 or more beers a night, stays up really late, and sleeps in really late
- overlaid with all of this has been him lying to me and gaslighting me about his drinking for two extended periods. He tells me he isn’t drinking, or is drinking far less than he actually is, even when I ask him to his face, and once lied to me for a whole year straight
- He does go through periods of not drinking at all, but there’s always eventually a reason after a few months or less that he needs to just have a few
- i caught him drunk on the sofa in the middle of the night a couple of nights ago. I thought he was having a glass or three of wine in the evening (I wasn’t thrilled with this, but it was an improvement). Turns out he’s also been buying 40s of cheap beer and also drinking 1-3 of those every night. This is why he hasn’t slept in the bed with me for months. 
- once I caught him, he confessed, but I still don’t know what to believe. He did confess to drinking in the morning for the first time recently, and said that scared him
- he of course appeared very remorseful and ashamed at being caught and at lying to me and about the drinking
- when I caught him after the year of lying about drinking a few years ago, I told him I knew he would mess up and make mistakes, and that the only thing I needed from him was honesty. I didn’t tell him he had to stop drinking, I just wanted honesty. It took a long time for me to think I could trust him again. Now after this second extended period of lying, it’s clear I cannot trust him about alcohol and he is indeed a functional alcoholic.
- he’s been out of work for almost a year, for unrelated reasons (as far as I know) so him sleeping it off isn’t affecting his work, and he is actively looking for work and has some prospects
- he hasn’t had any bad behavior in front of our kids, and that seems to be a boundary he really wants to stick to because his own father was an alcoholic

Okay, SO. Here are my questions:
1. He says the only way he will get through this is if I am not angry at him but supportive instead. I initially agreed, but I AM angry, I’m just not showing it. Am I actually enabling him by not expressing my anger? Will me being angry actually make him want to drink more and then make this all harder?

2. What kind of boundaries are reasonable for me to set? We got rid of the alcohol in the house (I hope). Is it reasonable to tell him he can’t drink around me, and there can be no alcohol in our house? I’m abstaining to try to make it easier on him.

3. Does AA actually work? If so, is there a way for him to attend meetings online during the pandemic? We can’t afford therapy right now and I don’t know what else to do.

In almost every other respect he is the perfect partner, and we have two amazing children together. I will not be walking away from this relationship without a fight. I just don’t know what direction to move in, and I don’t know how to help him and help myself.",5.7194778778260025,5.897524587743735,6.452733691779487,78.54006380773467,67.05013927576601,9.743136619809553,31.73945714840967,9.589985622208136,2.7859319427349867,2866,108,563,55,43,945,292,718,0.11800000000000001,0.785,0.09699999999999999,-0.9693,1,0,25,0,1,0,84.0,5,0,0,9,33,18,2,2,37,1,60,29,4,11,5,107,105,51,0,11,26,3,0,1,1,4,7,2,2,3,29,37,25,3,16,19,2,13,21,7,1,6,29,3,71,11,101,65,14,95,2,0,1,0,81,33,0,15,46,391,100,4,0.0,0.0,0.17882665378876691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12183079242186713,0.34271949518961503,0.09174976046975072,0.0,0.0,0.10990938774562417,0.038119901871060416,0.0,0.0,0.031154260509231906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04078308592411777,0.0428287638223651,0.0,0.043042613661547824,0.03522719897314471,0.0382517566209579,0.02792704468215908,0.0,0.0,0.05161531343012408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0484638453164307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036577775979393455,0.10138193653703036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08018214275020204,0.0,0.0,0.6283071483891328,0.0,0.0,0.0382706980439912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0605178165333573,0.0,0.07719848390252823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0779366523327886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023935286022734363,0.04394779184328703,0.05207291579243233,0.0,0.109921992631672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06141467975340754,0.0,0.0,0.04550242628807253,0.0,0.10572359137751708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04770695916508172,0.12588752535394893,0.0,0.10335761969583876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022381809584373597,0.0,0.0,0.08108573502676042,0.03847119587239286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12232154212121868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07313464577221708,0.048691733556679835,0.0,0.06793918984220321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17196875750256882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757822831543828,0.0,0.06968536522211294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04330788387870318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05132079690101636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804651743265808,0.18841266648142613,0.045234592080318665,0.09837155875927107,0.0,0.03912386270070358,0.04357844357300801,0.03643216041968078,0.04586658359155844,0.0,0.0,0.04170623312902433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03789680396426531,0.0,0.0916917282997498,0.0,0.0,0.03526891526003842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048830326519611215,0.036586144255774666,0.038301534361149366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051987798372967006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12012716361483987,0.0,0.052390905076979515,0.0,0.030435974505262562,0.0293549787577905,0.0,0.03637022895789452,0.08014139904544998,0.0,0.0,0.04377607331993625,0.0508996828164208,0.031103869513626658,0.04983114776480182,0.08950485588314917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037800340337234666,0.08106469155218139,0.07272810265973946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0413389070629645,0.051148331359934726,0.0,0.04416188384264146,0.0,0.13340899411081014,0.0,0.04668713539963786,0.03254408356202847,0.0,0.0,0.2360154196610873
alcoholism,Blizzard970,2020/03/22,"I can't tell if this is alcoholism or anxiety 22M. Joined a frat freshman year and learned a million drinking games and bad habits. I'm no stranger to the occasional night of binging.

As far as my drinking habits go, I probably average about 10 drinks a week. A beer with dinner a few times and a little splurge on friday. Maybe a few glasses of whiskey. About once a month the stars will align and I'll go get rip-roaring drunk with friends. Never black out but I may get sick. This has been pretty constant since my 21st a year ago, since now I have no restrictions on buying.

Never had any issues with the law, skipping work or school, avoiding responsibilities, etc. All of my friends and my father, when asked, have said that I do not have a problem. But drinking's a big part of college and my family culture so their definition of ""problem"" may not be accurate.

Here's the kicker. I have anxiety, worsened by this pandemic. I worry a lot about my health. I sometimes become fixated on an irrational belief that I have a condition. Last fall I was convinced I had diabetes despite working out 6 days a week and only felt relief after having bloodwork done. Many of the questionnaires about alcoholism are about personal feelings. (IE: have *you* ever wondered if you should cut back?)

Long story short, I cannot trust myself to answer a question like that. I was whole heartedly convinced that I had either diabetes or a brain tumor in the past year. Further more, I can easily go 2 weeks or more without drinking. During that time, I feel no strong urge to drink. Drinking doesn't cross my mind unless it's hot out on a Saturday afternoon and I think ""yknow what sounds great? An ice cold beer.""

However, my stupid brain has convinced itself that I'm having alcohol withdrawals. I keep telling myself that I just don't drink enough to experience withdrawals, and that compared to others I have the habits of a mormon, but there's still some nagging fear that I'm just in denial and that I'm slowly sliding down the path to destruction.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I'd rather ask those with real experience. I love myself a good whiskey or a cold beer and it'd just be a real bummer if I had to give those up.",3.99988366013072,6.070149840000003,4.61793137254902,82.9813022875817,72.95294117647059,7.451633986928106,28.27614379084968,8.256446698504663,2.0625830065359465,1762,70,324,29,36,562,235,425,0.152,0.727,0.121,-0.8384,1,1,16,0,0,0,53.0,0,2,1,3,17,22,4,2,32,0,35,26,3,0,4,67,55,29,0,8,22,1,4,1,2,4,7,2,0,1,21,18,18,3,9,15,1,6,12,10,0,1,10,9,36,12,40,38,12,48,2,0,1,1,17,16,0,15,27,219,57,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06774363009474954,0.2450161293635045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051969686592157324,0.0,0.11692548006745207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14288879893767806,0.0,0.0,0.058763920575530725,0.06380930796292146,0.0,0.08440226693098632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17062480046254705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08258520098456901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04928596826349015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07820639862042293,0.0,0.5989169479627595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07896451590290215,0.08523090503561997,0.0,0.06912821519971744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14951106532850786,0.07204400711934203,0.08599617193338828,0.07728267643356035,0.0,0.07337725419173527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11808713604264623,0.0,0.07985484442659407,0.07331109553494919,0.13029741692330873,0.06409927848603429,0.0,0.08425569659708365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08123317798674941,0.0,0.09056062261752704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07976487558766544,0.0,0.06792752348814161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0622942569311568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03733600510660672,0.07659507696291026,0.0,0.06763120304503333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06497138400497288,0.06897397935723701,0.0,0.0,0.07748007108050961,0.07677632736767627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07716459188111292,0.0,0.06099943567404341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11788295570595797,0.0,0.0,0.07171701626815108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813871018101775,0.0,0.05812249322335971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08275774747975795,0.0729535950874306,0.0,0.06672887873126462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774880674062128,0.08239600959899028,0.1462513641844855,0.0,0.0,0.08561030456220371,0.0,0.0,0.17397028854860244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0726949706924395,0.0,0.0,0.07734330168468677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12643439405558532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07558346622587132,0.08554834667824071,0.0,0.0,0.0610308323647944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13359266527752678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048968231664806745,0.0,0.0,0.08912474727097362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18390373108164887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08532260779227706,0.0,0.07366823108965256,0.08287656804731358,0.11127247925623612,0.07761040886563826,0.0,0.0,0.08355563044969014,0.0,0.1476400882682065
alcoholism,helixish,2020/03/22,"how to stop? long story sort i’m a 16 year old idiot that has let her mental issuse rule over her life. i wont go in to detail but some pretty dark stuff happened to me. i used all sorts of terrible coping methods that almost killed me when i was 12. i moved to cigarettes when i was 15, so currently i have 2 addictions to fight. but alcohol is worse.

i think tjis started around 14 years old, a year after the worst thing of my experiences happened to me. it developed really strongly last summer, and i only realized this was a problem in the winter break. i git really drunk on christmas eve and until new years there was 0 days where i was sober. 

right now i’m writing tiis after a little wine. still siber enough but can feel it. 3 days in and i’m still pretty sober to write this down but the world is spinning a little. same story, havent been 100% sober in the last 3 days. amd idk how long this quarantine thing will go on but once i start drinking and actively continue there’s no real escape for me. apparently there have been runors that schools will be cancelled all year. so i’m pretty dead if you look at it that way. 

death is no stranger to me and im honestly scared i’ll drink myself dead as an attpempt. so does anyone here with more life experience than this dumbass wirting tjis jave any tips on how to stop once you’re deep in the shit?

thank you so much in advance.",2.3109991787571857,4.353244804270466,3.532473309608541,88.98618874897349,77.82562277580071,6.7430057486997,21.839720777443198,7.748469712250963,0.8919393922803169,1094,31,227,17,26,355,168,281,0.22399999999999998,0.6679999999999999,0.10800000000000001,-0.991,2,1,6,0,1,0,24.0,0,2,0,2,18,11,4,1,11,0,20,9,1,4,2,33,35,22,4,2,6,0,1,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,14,7,5,2,3,4,0,4,4,8,0,0,7,2,22,3,31,23,8,57,0,0,1,0,7,19,1,5,32,136,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11272625766175605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110508051004943,0.10354475228861773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031866177409864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07230288813396032,0.0,0.0,0.09205200118141868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000622031682021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09049004669366427,0.0,0.0,0.20259424799438872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068445751752822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20229904630417905,0.0,0.0,0.052284463708395096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175344140206474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828806610392536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11169469306579614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11440184951463668,0.0,0.0,0.1685770713988436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057381911500551,0.14607542885584499,0.0,0.2072771133982072,0.0,0.18301960254718064,0.08683380591859181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10420749781642456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990270631370264,0.0760142657832981,0.0,0.0,0.09986878982060833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21701142894208053,0.22024501051455855,0.0,0.07864384433400738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155989040748932,0.0,0.09894422004885953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117697052660672,0.13248724633558434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08830694818552366,0.0,0.0,0.10352602583368904,0.10465095766958704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10614331764019956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14638059096970013,0.0,0.16515806579827752,0.17290172170015544,0.0,0.0,0.11837350726233098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09520104642418176,0.0,0.0,0.13739481932921752,0.06625748096454538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930835858299681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207774424442965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053781033382526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33294580334570106

alcoholism,GrandBill,2020/03/22,"safe to go cold turkey? I'm 60, slowly ramped up to 5 drinks a day over the past decade.  Trying to cut back has failed so now it's time to go cold turkey but am worried about what I hear can be severe side effects. 

I've gone only one day without booze at a time and that's been very rare but problem-free when it has happened.  Just one day though, as I recall. 

Don't have a doctor I trust to give me advice on this.  Tried Nal but had very bad side effects. 

My options as I see them are 1. try cold turkey anyway 2. try Nal on much lower dose 3. try to figure out a working strategy on cutting back (because willpower and self-motivation has not worked)

alcoholism,IntrepidFrosting9,2020/03/22,"Have an alcoholic mum, do I have a chance of becoming an alcoholic if I drink? Throwaway. 

I turned 18 in January and haven’t touched a drop of alcohol in fear of inheriting the alcoholic traits my mother has. She is drunk nearly every day and has said that she can’t seem to help herself, she’s been to rehab many times but nothing has worked. 

I have been to a couple of social events and people have offered me drinks that I’ve declined in fear that if I touch alcohol, I will inherit my mum’s alcoholism. I’ve tried to search it up on the internet with conflicting evidence, so does anybody know here whether I have a chance of becoming an alcoholic? I hardly want to get drunk as the images of seeing my mother drunk are burned deep into my brain and that’s turned me well off getting inebriated, it would be more for a social thing while retaining complete control.

alcoholism,fridaythe13th2020,2020/03/22,"Alcoholic Pandemic  

I wish I listened to myself before this virus. This is hard to admit, but yes, I am an alcoholic. I'm not going to go into my full history, but long story short, my new year's resolution was to quit drinking at home alone. I have anxiety and depression issues that I will be talking to my therapist about, though I can't afford more than every 2 weeks. I have daddy issues, which I think are the root of my mental health problems.

The reason I am writing now, is that despite my acknowledgement of my problems, I cannot shrug off this need for alcohol. I've been at home for 4 days now, yet I've binged on alcohol twice. I do my yoga, coffee, exercise routines for a few hours, but after 3-4 I am lost on how to keep myself busy. I cook, but only once or twice a week, and last time I cooked while drunk.

It's hard enough to be sober during this pandemic, being an alcoholic is so fucking hard for me. I need help thinking of ways I can keep myself sober, I don't know what to do.

I can't be the only one struggling with sobriety during this pandemic, please let me know what you all are doing to curb these drinking cravings.",5.703316683316686,5.315351865800867,6.766839826839827,78.19663336663338,67.13852813852813,9.87825507825508,30.323343323343323,9.466822959209583,2.5448032634032645,895,29,178,16,13,302,136,231,0.136,0.8059999999999999,0.059000000000000004,-0.9481,1,1,7,0,0,0,30.0,0,1,0,2,7,6,1,1,7,1,26,13,0,3,1,29,42,11,0,5,6,0,3,0,0,1,7,1,2,0,12,4,10,3,7,7,0,2,5,6,0,3,3,4,31,0,26,33,5,25,0,2,0,1,6,8,1,1,14,125,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5566495598098655,0.0,0.10789244680654428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07969252944185863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08864407261748596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06718336285030208,0.0,0.0897245809420173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20410096448274684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10763919044546832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08777076262028596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963068273517195,0.0,0.0,0.11840853083939995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799572886175625,0.0,0.0,0.11073168012019667,0.0,0.0,0.06982537746263537,0.0,0.2089892569313498,0.0,0.10259002544298036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174603753614415,0.0,0.18518858891555307,0.0,0.0,0.11450218756780345,0.0849153991359464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10652457811628016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09219037008435496,0.0,0.0,0.11371780536465867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10498250084205288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1544868293471569,0.0,0.10061152538089556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109414988666884,0.0705907367634238,0.1584574551163613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11435134523282355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1993601589569779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11080146128849457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071078251049356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10890487968837832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373080476770423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12095359483361512,0.0,0.13350049078822318,0.1023500466666023,0.0,0.060744471964476285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08268816577319757,0.16712357871283867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11979451477632418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06708439183843236
alcoholism,jdd91500,2020/03/22,"40+, holding together a decent life, holding down a decent job, but when I drink, I go hard. Always have. I’ve gone a couple of months but always come back. I’ve never seen the best side of myself and I want to be ready to give it up entirely. I keep telling myself I can be a person who only has a couple and calls it a night, but the fights (once with a rather costly medical bill attached to it), DUIs, ruined friendships, “sick” days from work, etc, prove I cant.  Now, my son watches me get up late, often hungover. I’m keeping up with responsibilities but I just don’t have a good reason to keep drinking any more. I like drinking a lot, but know it’s a road block to much better things. Please tell me it’s worth it to completely quit.  Honestly, it’s shocking I’m not dead or in jail by now. I haven’t done anything really bad in a few years, but I know that side of me is still in there. I am also afraid that if I don’t give it up and never look back, then eventually, he will emerge again and who knows what will happen that time. If I say so myself, I’m a pretty good husband and father, but I could be doing it better. Anyway, thanks for reading. Just looking for, I guess, anyone with a similar situation and some advice.",2.9074388727724814,4.023841007874015,4.48982594280978,86.68337546622463,73.96062992125984,6.922171570658931,22.81723995026937,7.273561745256523,0.7340976377952759,952,24,203,10,19,320,152,254,0.11900000000000001,0.6970000000000001,0.184,0.956,1,0,3,0,1,0,40.0,0,0,0,5,15,13,1,1,15,0,18,6,0,1,3,43,40,20,1,5,14,3,1,1,0,2,3,1,0,1,16,10,3,6,5,4,3,3,7,5,0,0,3,6,22,8,24,31,7,30,0,1,4,0,14,11,0,7,17,137,38,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10818920229727792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08853857009450808,0.18424713337233692,0.0,0.0,0.07528984742112747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07741434888509012,0.0,0.09110883097337838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17026566462560236,0.09244221729251463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11618833174463734,0.1958364527069954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130521697095154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09537098018286247,0.11608234108627982,0.0,0.0,0.08839674341416784,0.24500759794537755,0.0,0.07140187432111023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11329965996708725,0.0,0.3253750064719099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12347624656764465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05784390331135306,0.2124154121004446,0.06292176127280688,0.18572461038262905,0.0,0.0,0.12196481299290733,0.0,0.09790471489740483,0.0,0.09917869687316544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10986733623520144,0.2952251522653412,0.0,0.0,0.18253784402900866,0.0,0.12489109498209168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07820112380596643,0.054089649411414066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18594506305052266,0.0,0.0,0.09412574732001727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11153349373035244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08837148164304455,0.0,0.08138810279181975,0.0,0.17078012839108556,0.0,0.0,0.10389832162548487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179076280644868,0.0,0.0842035796918323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09667187600507866,0.0,0.12153158214120628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11263673461443342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177587973847736,0.11074474165307836,0.0,0.07092672350546406,0.1138332340402588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804483734759115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12444805223050835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08841696685204188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19353919649853366,0.10193129503281416,0.0,0.0,0.07355398071270221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06455867894815029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06530244615495312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08060167892793157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07129668881905815
alcoholism,mojojojono1,2020/03/22,"Dating an alcoholic I (28F) am worried about my boyfriend (37M) and our future. We have a loving and fulfilling relationship and are very much in love with each other. We’ve often talked about marriage and living together. He has been an alcoholic for most of his life. He has had several DUIs in the past and a few years ago he completed a 2 year Christian rehab program. He lives with sober roommates and his boss is also sober. I’m the only person in his immediate group who drinks. My roommates drink too so when he stays with me he wants to drink. I’ve expressed my concern after seeing him drunk a few times. He will sometimes black out and not recall the night before, leaving me to make sure he is okay. I recently noticed he was hiding alcohol and drinking it in his room alone. His boss smelled alcohol on him a few weeks ago and told him he would be fired if it happened again. I love him dearly and want a future with him but I am really scared about how this is going to affect us. I want him to be sober. Alcohol has ruined relationships and jobs for him. I just don’t know how to support him or help him. I don’t want to give up on him because he is honestly the best person I know. Even when he is drunk.

alcoholism,Venmorr,2020/03/23,"I don't know what to do or what to put for a title. I am renting space from my fiance's family. Her father suffers from severe alchohalisum. He is verbally abusive to his two daughters and wife. We are stuck in the house due to corona and things are getting worse. 

Spicificly today the sister learned that one of her friends died (not from corona) and she was understandably devistaded. The father started telling at her for some reason. (she did absolutely nothing to him) when she told him to leave her alone and that she was sad because her friend died he yelled at her that she was lieing and called her a cunt which is his go to. 

I don't know what to do to keep my fiance and her sister from loosing it. Their mother is lucky enough to still have a job to go to and get away from all this, but that's only untill like 4:30. And when she gets home her go to way of dealing with this is just to yell at him. Not that I would want to leave this house because I want to be by my fiance's side but I don't have any place to go so I am starting to feel more and more trapped. I can't even go to my parents house because we can't risk my Grandmother getting Corona. 

I don't know if this is the right place to post about this. I just don't have any one to talk to about my place in this hole mess.",3.7211726117261184,4.234612509225098,4.302330873308733,91.03257790077902,71.50922509225092,7.203034030340303,24.649651496514963,6.937597516519254,0.6705176711767113,1014,26,231,8,18,322,130,271,0.125,0.833,0.042,-0.9475,3,2,0,0,0,0,21.0,2,0,1,0,9,9,1,1,7,0,27,0,0,1,1,34,48,17,2,4,8,8,1,1,2,1,0,2,2,0,17,12,0,1,7,0,1,6,9,5,0,3,6,3,39,4,42,40,5,28,0,2,0,0,40,12,1,4,9,162,56,2,0.0,0.12780753778787102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11172011225276213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14670971051083276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10134680275983518,0.0,0.0,0.19726845897346246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11014666425031364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11120856068148488,0.0,0.0,0.22390270453414854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145787119765968,0.0,0.07124668664279132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10168962063852506,0.0,0.05454198317592422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16667918049831354,0.0,0.2254291275730181,0.0,0.30652317999567363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820175060936488,0.0,0.0,0.3734002323831001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704368281891087,0.0958792323000746,0.0,0.0,0.1778465169744288,0.0,0.0,0.2284361276653785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052699514467034095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350354811920363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14619012300936218,0.08203949950559987,0.0,0.0,0.11977614485334925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.338101527757499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330901700395367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084384878889265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11090765478076824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211983332399924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12186165881596946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15270095863428146,0.0,0.08614460020454845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08670129545245077,0.09428256419480814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07166360131480208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224752853954096,0.1030737841163924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10537267841776776,0.11229579489987557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12724827183477574,0.08562166709149377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099280805755481,0.07662728949722168,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,DowntownCompetition,2020/03/23,"Advice dealing with a drinking problem in a fraternity I've realized that my drinking and drug use has gotten out of hand. I've tried to just cut back in the past, but that hasn't worked out, so I may have to stop fully. I know this will be difficult being in college, and especially being in a fraternity. Many of my brothers, who I live with and spend most of my time with, are heavy drinkers. I know the common recommendation would be to cut ties, but I don't know if I can do that. Any advice on dealing with this situation?",4.5815229110512155,5.265490386792454,5.900619946091645,79.72915094339623,69.66037735849056,8.698652291105121,29.293800539083556,8.841846274778883,2.147923450134772,415,15,85,7,7,140,64,106,0.12,0.86,0.021,-0.8402,0,0,4,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,3,4,2,0,5,0,14,4,1,1,0,23,19,7,0,3,4,1,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,6,9,2,1,4,2,1,0,2,4,0,0,1,1,9,0,17,11,1,12,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,3,5,61,15,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892825754612908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13545263800748789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15316097870829426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4107020008661434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3902509610342329,0.23099137601537345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3284006191648932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17588401418843902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20194233810227494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19014463150935806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1905931552603582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22389229819033632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16652758833465992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161463818739464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352335478036125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17203189681066214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14500906048532122,0.0,0.0,0.1414953171078032,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,betterdays7654,2020/03/24,"I want to quit Hi all. I'm 36f and I've been drinking heavily every single day for about eight years. I'd rather not go into the damage it has done to me physically, mentally and everything in between. Right now, I feel like I'm ready to quit. I've been so worried about everything in my life and how badly I messed everything up, but when I drink, it all kind of fades away. Now,  with all this coronavirus concern going on, it's really put things in perspective. I want to try to quit without help, but I'm scared of withdrawal/seuzures. Does anybody have any advice on how to quit without experiencing awful withdrawal? I understand that it won't be fun, I just don't want to have seizures or anything equally life threatening.

alcoholism,bugluver1000,2020/03/24,"Breaking up I recently just ended a 3.5 year long relationship due to my partners alcoholism. In these moments of waiting for me to move out they aren’t drinking and it’s really making me regret the break up. We had many good times but the drinking would never stop(sloppy and sometimes belligerent drunk on a sometimes daily basis) even though they knew I had a big problem with it and I carry some really bad emotions from my mother being a drunk who abandoned me. I keep on thinking I should stay and try to help them work through it, but another part of of me thinks if I stay we will will just go back to our old dynamic after a few weeks or more. I feel really conflicted. Worst part is I care about them greatly as a person and would love to still be involved in their life as a friend. I don’t know I’ve never gone through anything like this before and very confused on the best path.

alcoholism,subberhubber,2020/03/24,"My room mate is an alcoholic and idk how to help him I am 25 my room mate is 27 we have been friends for a little over ten years. This guy has serious mental issues. His parents beat him as a kid and he's just always been superrr depressed. a mutual friend of ours got him in the habit of drinking multiple times a week until it became every day. His girlfriend kicked him out and I let him move in with me and he was drinking a lot at first but I was thinking oh he might be upset because of the break up and after the third day I mentioned it and he got offended and started going on about ""how's it any different than having a beer after work?"" well the difference is its every day and he's out doing it while he's working driving a company truck drinking tall boy Mike hard lemonade he comes home on his lunch booze in hand and comes home after work booze in hand drinks nothing but booze and energy drinks and every single night/morning pukes his fucking guts out and I'm fairly certain he's shitting himself now. It's been two months and he's drank 3-6 Mike hard lemonade a day in the giant can. He doesn't care. He hates himself. He already goes to therapy and takes anti depression and hipolar and anti anxiety medicine but I'm all he has left and he's all I have left. All our friends either died in this shitty little coal town we were raised in (yes, in our 20s and teens) or moved away. Idk how to talk to him about it. If I bring it up he gets offended if I keep going with it he'll just yell and storm off to his room.

 Idk what to do. I'm in my mid 20's and all my friends are dead except one and I'm watching him slowly die.",1.0239696382428924,3.1693865843023263,2.6465503875969,93.10762273901811,82.86627906976744,5.450129198966407,21.183462532299746,6.691623216298621,0.36620633074935416,1291,40,279,14,36,423,184,344,0.171,0.742,0.087,-0.9842,2,0,7,0,0,0,22.0,5,0,0,5,9,16,5,1,14,1,23,17,4,3,5,52,44,33,3,2,10,1,4,0,7,2,1,1,5,3,12,30,12,1,1,6,0,8,1,9,1,5,9,6,31,7,41,31,7,56,0,2,1,1,49,31,2,5,16,168,43,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816395317886796,0.0,0.0,0.10136313361233032,0.0,0.07642985650023924,0.0,0.0,0.06246384547750744,0.0,0.07026803121436258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08629982303403615,0.0,0.0,0.05599332403197006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09365123826998913,0.0,0.0,0.1582481137425988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23695283213692275,0.0,0.15822736957870193,0.0,0.19065982598315295,0.19193568498425306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44990957884008775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2321727794577136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07813093504349,0.0,0.0,0.2838645796167792,0.08491750980804387,0.04798990517335453,0.0,0.10440544928543204,0.0,0.1469280124150774,0.0,0.0,0.09094986583931887,0.0,0.0,0.16456621997104812,0.0906867730841316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061567776019441675,0.0,0.1842740308579674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09587167423850562,0.0,0.08164402383510512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19959920177623375,0.09392690171332332,0.0,0.0,0.18412360610506465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07809095565257587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925671916526781,0.09744254047778568,0.0,0.0,0.07331695790394865,0.195252454797644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08619872306402758,0.0,0.0881363559859838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06224262335600714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10199295708457858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09428677429679944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06501470864598784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906274972794206,0.07382873707520157,0.0,0.0,0.1050430132400498,0.0,0.0,0.05885631137284685,0.0,0.0,0.05356078520777648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08972797614173643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0736797095530605,0.0,0.08258774505308304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2006123397868319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0591509414083614

alcoholism,ColoRADoDankDabber,2020/03/24,"Reactions to getting clean from others Has anyone ever dealt with others weather friends or family members having disdain or resentment when you hop on the wagon,and start doing the right thing? Almost like they always expected you to be a fuck up, and would rather see you in your addiction. Maybe it makes them feel better about themselves...""at least I'm not like so and so."" I think that once the person decides to make such a polar change to their lifestyle some of those around them dont know how to take it almost, or seeing someone make such a change makes them look at their own faults and they dont like that. Alot of people cannot understand what it was like to live in addiction. I've had people treat me like I'm a piece of shit, and act like they are better than me bc they didn't go thru what I did. I am a pastors son, my father pastors a baptist church where the congregation is about 80-100 people where everyone knows eachothers business. Being the pastors son, and having struggled in addiction with people talking dosent help. Reading people's body language and faces is not difficult, and I am almost shunned or not treated the same as others and it hurts, and I never wish to go back... Like they never made mistakes smdh... hypocritical to what jesus said on how to treat people... the apostle Paul killed Jewish wemon and children and GOD chose him so that just goes to say that past mistakes dont define you!!!  Some people make the assumption that since we went thru shit like this we are worthless, terrible, disgusting people and that is NOT true. They dont understand and have never lived thru this shit. I dont care what they think, I dont care what they say, I dont care how much trash and gossip they want to talk. I have nothing to prove to them. Everyday that I do better and rise up, the more they can get pissed off and proven wrong. I am getting happier every day and finding a new peace!! Slowly and surely I am becoming a different person. People change, I guess some people cant or wont accept that. Their problem...I wish I never went thru this shit honestly, but it has made me stronger. I accept my past but dont wish to erase it or close the door on it, as it will have made me into how I want to become...",6.393849658314352,6.2881561936218695,6.310791799544418,81.09360455580867,65.65148063781322,8.937439635535307,29.177312072892946,8.364918446050245,1.9459522733485184,1775,51,342,21,25,560,212,439,0.115,0.763,0.121,-0.6821,1,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,2,5,17,3,19,42,9,1,19,0,38,11,7,12,8,88,78,36,1,10,14,3,1,8,1,3,3,3,2,3,29,25,0,0,12,1,0,6,20,19,0,0,10,7,47,23,42,63,10,35,6,2,3,1,39,16,6,14,21,234,76,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18179958451646053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16699208627518344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04625423114248807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0388688944195404,0.0,0.0,0.04948570668987453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04274426018507815,0.0,0.0,0.12278664944662485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474909983754621,0.0,0.06174648692472525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17002907842853568,0.0,0.17641634369120282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03585009696928481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058078334464265476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5211961095839451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05028313951294102,0.046835856639337335,0.053117361652707466,0.0,0.0,0.05240405600791495,0.0,0.02810730459201902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050807042344808914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04294767280741465,0.05139083476747682,0.08712836585219062,0.0,0.06318465067075682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06123719319989455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03725991743715069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05950882684864309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061500633307288034,0.0,0.06110016458460942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2172625517042492,0.0,0.09817163781886287,0.0,0.04668048706496032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15779804654408794,0.185529362789223,0.0,0.05584629617829159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04086407261679136,0.0,0.1714936539540445,0.05368788920509579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05333883338927303,0.0,0.0,0.059200125202882675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10613136153316673,0.3853818833349053,0.09707577460498408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05319085505101026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055603718597726594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04747242515645464,0.052877560091151264,0.08841269186746954,0.0,0.0,0.08859395458702979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2282439063320818,0.0459835268216005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04710010436981222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03934595064120821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05811335324127949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05239166880573621,0.0,0.04179576588949945,0.08936014343095522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03693064595431306,0.07123795739235454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11573954329724333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06557528214058145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10306251823870108,0.0,0.0,0.1917727003643284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03948860016718183,0.06077749021662409,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,georgeyellow,2020/03/24,"When is it too much? I have hit a bit of a rough patch in this isolation... though I guess it has been going on for awhile. I’m 20, and this is definitely my first post here as I’ve never considered myself an alcoholic. I do have addictive tendencies, but alcohol has only become an “issue” in the last year or so. 

Basically I’m drinking a handle of vodka in around a week, or sometimes a little more. I drink every night, usually shots or a mixed drink followed by shots. I don’t really have a gauge for what’s normal and what’s not, as my family is pretty dysfunctional and my dad attaches a ton of shame to drinking. I could go through a handle a year and he’d guilt me for it. 

Since I dont know what’s “normal” or acceptable, I was hoping for some input here. I know the amount that’s “too much” is different for every person, so I guess I’m wondering how you realized your drinking was a problem. I know the answer is usually if you think it’s a problem, it is. But I really like alcohol and find myself defending my use quite a lot. 

Sorry if this was all over the place, I’m kind of lost right now.

alcoholism,goose756,2020/03/25,"Well... here I am So I met this girl on a dating app a while back. We've been texting almost every day for the past few months. She has been out of the country, with plans to come back soon, but given the whole virus situation that has all been delayed. We finally FaceTimed for the first time two days ago, and had a ""virtual happy hour"". She's a really cool girl, and I've really enjoyed talking to her, so I was pretty excited to finally get to chat with her ""in person"". Well I poured a drink and was doing fine, and then I poured a much heavier drink and remember nothing after that point. I woke up in my bathtub, with my arms covered in bruises from falling. I had texts from her asking if I was okay. My laptop was shut so I was hoping that I just abruptly left the conversation before blacking out. I've blacked out before, I've embarrassed myself before, but this was a new low. The next day I reached back out to her and apologized profusely, she told me she had never witnessed someone pass out like that (so great, she saw everything) that it was okay and not to worry about it, but I am worried about it and it's not okay.

Not only do I feel terrible that I made the world's worst first impression with someone that I was pretty excited about, but I feel terrible about letting myself down yet again. I had a night like this in December, and told myself I would never let it happen again. Since that night I probably only drank maybe three or four times. 99% of the time I can manage my alcohol fine, but it's that last 1%, when I just go completely off the rails. I'm tired of playing this roulette game of which night I'm going to have this time.

My last relationship was a marriage that ended in divorce, and for the last 6 months or so I've been trying really really hard to get my life on track. Physically I've been taking great care of myself as far as eating right and exercising regularly, and I've been trying so hard to stay positive. But now I've slipped up. I have felt so terrible about myself these last 36 hours. I just boxed up and tucked away all of the alcohol in my house (which was a lot). I don't want to feel this way anymore.",4.9695255162997105,5.281802755760372,5.823128520225296,81.9433171189623,68.6774193548387,9.194606588154976,28.28605564089435,9.150863307647796,2.119543710530808,1692,53,347,30,27,557,205,434,0.087,0.7290000000000001,0.184,0.9936,0,0,4,0,1,0,53.0,1,0,0,3,27,26,0,1,21,4,33,10,1,1,4,55,58,34,0,4,15,0,6,2,0,1,5,0,0,3,25,24,6,1,5,6,0,5,6,6,2,5,29,10,47,20,52,26,7,77,0,1,3,0,25,26,0,6,46,241,72,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07212127392509163,0.17389950274956378,0.08147090086002855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068786530906849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606118977236748,0.0,0.07644097363137238,0.18768386666668996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20769566612711926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08295256680095654,0.0,0.0,0.07008496347113928,0.0853050542112198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15741259271859015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15940485179930527,0.0,0.08325221824315109,0.0,0.0,0.07206135352812322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06854982504985364,0.0,0.07312167231419109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12341511081410927,0.0,0.07811894700699511,0.17825314814366278,0.0,0.13841059078645865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0850151239471641,0.0,0.0924782220312514,0.0,0.0,0.1794007249250922,0.0,0.0,0.07194692089858501,0.08660988485540985,0.14576625581793135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08080944608522501,0.16024762884653224,0.09387922309098172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2652790328364885,0.0,0.0,0.08839854349297199,0.16639347717579805,0.05746740669787146,0.07949737112688038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06916988322829988,0.0,0.07698537872456099,0.0,0.0,0.08173767082310299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12988252927605254,0.0,0.05980941162828692,0.0,0.12550064009970696,0.07857858650148332,0.08652793436453524,0.22905426981686605,0.0,0.0780677019607875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12375682404702128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07766791073584044,0.0,0.07104094857273903,0.0,0.0,0.0769120768462981,0.0,0.0,0.16554598507480792,0.08772050110559147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2084867667911955,0.0,0.0,0.08735084942009574,0.09216571361078528,0.06948151849183896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06730233938218334,0.09145273727821963,0.0,0.0,0.13787316582008208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08671958750570624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0611730551148592,0.0653945784080835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1897681096346396,0.09351205539026043,0.0,0.15548710367110813,0.0,0.11047703041550302,0.0,0.07947749621157132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04798859720819286,0.06458026714394659,0.0,0.0,0.14630592323201824,0.0,0.0,0.09083621825377944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652513025773291,0.0,0.057796244739770276,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Happy-Mood,2020/03/25,My (22F) boyfriend(37M) is checking himself into a year long rehab. So we’ve been talking off and on since the end of December. We met on Hinge. We’ve began talking everyday since February. He came over for the first time a couple weeks ago and stayed 5 nights. Well we drank 4 out of the 5 nights he was there. I didn’t think much of it. He told me when he met his only vice is occasionally smoking a cigarette. Well today he told me he lied and he’s an alcoholic. He also told me that in a couple of days he’s going to rehab for a year. I can’t visit him because I can’t drive. But he told me he’ll call me if they let him. I told him I’ll wait on him. He’s also been in the Army for 2 deployments so maybe that’s why he drinks. My mother is a meth addict. She has a year clean and she graduates in November from drug court. I get off probation in a year and 5 months. So I will only have 5 months left when he gets out of rehab. I don’t really know how long we’ve been together but when we met he called me his girlfriend and told me he loved me. I told him I’m not going anywhere and I know this isn’t gonna be easy. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t want me to tell my family so what should I tell them when they ask about him? Also what are some ways I can keep myself busy?,0.26052009456264713,1.9249992836879457,2.626595744680852,94.83388888888894,82.75886524822695,6.021749408983452,17.536643026004732,7.093109894594671,-0.11138392434988154,986,20,241,13,27,338,144,282,0.006999999999999999,0.902,0.091,0.9657,0,0,5,0,0,0,26.0,3,0,3,1,16,4,0,0,13,0,21,9,0,1,1,28,50,22,0,3,4,1,0,0,1,4,6,0,1,0,6,14,3,2,3,1,1,5,7,0,2,1,18,0,41,4,25,26,2,44,0,0,0,1,55,14,0,2,23,135,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009392347886416,0.0,0.0,0.08207745525485198,0.09895297100958823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22213799997808611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656126771493887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056443384666570035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1890941077668075,0.10590088304752206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2049031577572208,0.0,0.059714350252278475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09070516838452508,0.10737763003233028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08200926298045959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08728774590980078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07875893237737724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09675127257189793,0.0,0.105244634734295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823002585168958,0.0,0.0,0.10177257349131276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10060176565481094,0.09468186316135184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16388247969577766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08356813321820313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302137433938193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14781252333555006,0.0,0.0680659677730936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17378313460698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408411781349309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09419961991180728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0593169752183886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15318655504963746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09869103353071118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08726711294665479,0.0,0.0,0.14884430878950433,0.16185943964556535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05932938399899694,0.0,0.0,0.05399129369065421,0.0,0.08776663965332307,0.6193311328131108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05461331623439649,0.07349542927318624,0.07427192902586155,0.0,0.16650313027010952,0.0,0.0835501163694956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23850552879451334

alcoholism,Penny_Dropper,2020/03/25,"(M/36) Doctor told me today that I have to stop drinking immediately or she'll stop prescribing me crucial meds. Looks like it's time to go cold turkey. How should I prep? I've gotten wasted every single night for about 3 years. I've been preparing to quit for a few months ever since a scary liver enzyme test result, and have significantly reduced my intake in preparation. But I'm still drinking a pint of gin each night. I have excellent insurance and planned to finish off my detox at a nearby inpatient center that specializes in this, but that's no longer an option given the virus. I also feel like the ER is off limits due to the virus. 

My doctor just emailed me and basically said, ""Detox immediately or I'll stop writing you prescriptions."" She and I had initially planned a tapering-down schedule, but she seems to have gotten quite concerned about my health and needs me to stop drinking immediately. As in tomorrow.

So, people who've been there before, how should I prepare? I live alone and no family members or friends can come by to take care of me. I'm well stocked on food, toilet paper, meds, and other essentials, and Mom is willing to drop groceries and meds by my door if detox lasts for weeks or months. Two of my prescriptions--Valium, which should help deter potential seizures, and Suboxone, which should help with pain--will come in handy. 

What should I expect in terms of symptoms? What will be the worst aspects, and how can I ameliorate them? Are there any foods, supplements, or anything else that might help with the suffering? I'm really scared.",5.545079662605438,7.381094274914091,5.5858184942205575,78.57426663542644,68.45017182130584,8.864792252421116,28.347547641362077,9.339509955726095,2.5319264604811003,1258,44,222,26,22,395,173,291,0.122,0.7829999999999999,0.095,-0.7649,0,1,3,0,0,0,45.0,0,1,1,6,13,10,0,1,11,0,22,13,1,4,1,48,39,26,0,8,10,1,1,2,1,9,7,1,1,0,11,16,5,5,2,3,0,3,2,3,2,1,8,4,25,7,32,21,5,34,0,1,1,0,14,10,0,9,22,138,36,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11042595932194904,0.0,0.08526381659809765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07250512104906877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877390118937901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09072559800726168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870599328704186,0.0,0.0,0.1836870361563878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21825976904577898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3133404441455577,0.0,0.0,0.08906716285208187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09644371439634516,0.08983178108976075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10051165976891124,0.0,0.053910175115977205,0.07616920736948073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257850173952771,0.0,0.08237419402103903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060594490146692236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11333186304068725,0.0,0.0,0.2143950161354861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690936843434645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417809870539753,0.0,0.09414723793436887,0.0,0.08953378022899024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3552916906717758,0.0,0.0,0.11310676021723147,0.0,0.12487182269944255,0.17020581640909244,0.0,0.0,0.0790572317071193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20011092183823287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11345098586362044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07391674555307277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2268065655975775,0.0,0.0,0.06830337488417362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10141984674791624,0.0,0.10674502110001026,0.0,0.0,0.09706266276564382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881970014338058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514671106372654,0.35655571210201303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11081879756839456,0.0801648215976247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0621708635657308,0.0,0.10106310492896972,0.10187978925625096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041520534304472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08552397341480572,0.0,0.09586400591362317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0686596563851316

He got in our faces and says we hate him and well, to a degree it is really close to hate, but not quite. He’s a completely different person sober vs. intoxicated. Says he’s gonna quit his job, that he’s the one that makes all the money, he doesn’t give a shit about us, and you can never get any point across to him and if we are right about the stuff we say, he reverts to using my moms weight as a reason he drinks and rants about how that is a problem and how she needs help with that even though she isn’t obese, and calls out everyone else’s issues while he’s at that. 

It all just doesn’t make sense. I’m (M22), still living at home and feel held down. I sense negativity in the house whenever he comes in, and I haven’t had an actual conversation with him in months cause I despise his actions. Despise how he consciously decides to drink when he knows that’s why we “hate” him, and frankly that’s exactly the case. He knows he needs help but doesn’t want it and doesn’t think there’s a way. Please I need advice for my mom, me and my siblings (M20, F10) on how to handle this.

Forgot some details, but I’m raging inside right now and can’t think 100% straight.",5.0477731092436935,4.747802812925169,5.443141256502603,86.84065426170471,68.48979591836735,8.822408963585435,26.13765506202481,8.313332769828598,1.2932771508603444,1113,26,251,14,17,356,168,294,0.138,0.802,0.06,-0.9764,3,0,4,0,0,0,35.0,7,1,0,4,18,11,7,0,15,0,13,9,2,11,4,63,42,28,0,7,7,4,2,0,0,1,3,4,1,1,14,24,6,3,8,3,1,2,10,10,1,2,5,6,26,1,30,36,5,31,0,0,0,0,45,17,1,2,11,142,40,4,0.0,0.0,0.09377707211244457,0.0,0.0,0.09390513884463632,0.0,0.10269875525922292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.065349438072808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981260557230908,0.0,0.0,0.09871836622786308,0.0,0.08277928800336568,0.100756157968195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06197478842174465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10040119259353787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824162163185475,0.0,0.0,0.08027693711708637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06347133970129487,0.0,0.08096609357182451,0.09182505845851023,0.0,0.0,0.09059195254937064,0.0,0.0485896664850963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10041371331758116,0.09218525667295158,0.0,0.0,0.07685776448023299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2846284734655789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1932359208197552,0.0,0.09639339585901513,0.0,0.0946364524082694,0.11088334588318316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10030058173158203,0.19072342238568327,0.08541566787700061,0.0,0.0,0.10562509150001016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08485564889898188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12829134621013086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22509591947342011,0.0767039231031018,0.0,0.0,0.2850196285669607,0.07411613787669645,0.0,0.0,0.09018077692408792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13023599265777422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08390842843710278,0.0,0.10548594363067454,0.09084298036080872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09195210798404184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044225483465422,0.0,0.0,0.12312474215817952,0.09880399726316716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16413308490959308,0.0,0.22926121554055476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09864246542765673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07674340296593075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000838166050188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12315049916799455,0.09441507864457617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2311863643481941,0.16599437194504238,0.0,0.0,0.05668065890924452,0.07627753898230216,0.0,0.11702058459519153,0.08640298543359341,0.0,0.08671283808223404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399199123409869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Left-Extent,2020/03/26,"My Mom needs help and I don't know what to do. My Mom and I have always had a rocky relationship. My Mom neglected me from the day I was born and I have trauma from the neglect that I don't think will ever completely be healed, because it's developmental. 

When I got into my teens, I dealt with severe depression and anxiety and the only way I could connect with my Mom was when she would drink and party with me. I had to watch my Mom go in and out of mental institutions and rehabs - sometimes even having to live in them with her - throughout my entire childhood.  

I won't keep going through the past, but eventually I ended up hating her for many years and stopped talking to her for 3 after having my own children and moving to another state. The more I started to learn about trauma, I started to have a sense of compassion for my Mom and when she contacted me and told me she was sorry, we started talking again. 

My Mom is what they call a ""functional alcoholic"". My Mom drinks herself stupid when she knows she doesn't have to be to places like work or social gatherings where she has to make a good impression. She's done it for a long time and seems to think she has it under control, but theres some weeks she would completely lose it and call me crying saying how much she wants to die and how she's tired of drinking. 

So with the coronavirus forcing her to work out of home instead of her office, I was worried from the beginning that it would cause her to drink herself into a hole of misery and it has. She is about to lose her job because she hasn't worked in over 4 days. She says she just drinks and goes to bed. 

I've struggled with addiction myself, but alcohol is an entirely different demon I've never personally had to battle with outside of having to battle my Mom. 

When I moved back to my home city, I thought my Mom was doing a lot better, but I learned she's just gotten better at masking it and the closer I got the more I realized nothing had really changed as far as her alcoholism. As much as she's hurt me, my Mom has a lot of great qualities and I still love her and want her to be happy. She currently has a new girlfriend who isn't helping her and all she does is drink with her. My Mom even said just now when I called her that ""she's no good for me"". She was drunk and crying, and hung up. 

I want her to get help and be around for her Grandkids, and I tell her that, but I don't know how to best support her that would encourage her to get help. She gone through so many rehabs and she's 53 years old– when is enough going to be enough?",6.439562482329656,5.352482853053433,6.7739270568278185,81.06358071812272,65.88931297709924,9.976703420978232,31.2394684761097,9.049649993220411,2.3169986711902752,2021,62,426,29,27,657,226,524,0.142,0.7390000000000001,0.11900000000000001,-0.8447,3,0,9,0,0,0,41.0,1,0,2,9,28,25,4,1,19,0,48,16,0,6,3,84,79,48,1,9,9,13,0,1,1,6,8,3,3,2,15,40,10,5,10,7,0,6,9,13,0,0,18,4,94,12,71,49,12,57,1,6,1,1,83,17,0,5,33,318,109,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05476908783642027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1610740552644471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04180375970033602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05268108989018635,0.03843351310612142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04472431040291525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038631509749694426,0.0,0.06125175605028645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05272384987852402,0.08886651162148952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15390217420384866,0.0,0.0,0.05161038721864078,0.05314732841168161,0.0,0.10535150704172358,0.0,0.056348506207988924,0.040112604764497815,0.0,0.1103727071896072,0.06480137284396817,0.0,0.04327169537380728,0.0,0.05214125679983882,0.05249017609352696,0.0,0.0,0.04396542046626002,0.0514130306692198,0.0,0.2952968295155945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04449778658399641,0.10382283673744873,0.0,0.06636617975845578,0.04544501614786516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0524967219820057,0.0,0.08565776215974237,0.08427796775740394,0.08036314086535877,0.05538985031425698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053481484647057854,0.0,0.04960166410879068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346994293515542,0.0,0.10078976538408994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053783029923600734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049855513503277764,0.044655679202545116,0.0,0.0,0.08283187942561268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024544758606373708,0.0,0.04436289886784407,0.04446087759681736,0.0,0.11241156626360052,0.0,0.08542461531010884,0.04534362122060062,0.0,0.03353563428826653,0.10187108321019957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05063017010860662,0.0,0.0,0.7060866995232081,0.0,0.1067944789512444,0.0738644586605288,0.037252372474692916,0.03874823623131261,0.04852216897161815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048206698471163635,0.0,0.0527184981555021,0.0,0.0,0.03820983422555601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04795982794022217,0.0,0.04386768792901877,0.05249017609352696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03218507285823273,0.0,0.0,0.053939029245534335,0.0,0.0,0.04778980778603989,0.07990583421226745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045736669355267316,0.0,0.0567569745045998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05121342057850126,0.0,0.0,0.049688710076235015,0.05623964086131514,0.10668053225570537,0.0,0.04012178174024475,0.042002944918470494,0.0,0.05252182544761057,0.0,0.0,0.05701183171677919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08076212425340233,0.043912032252196524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438361159217779,0.0,0.03988500066828032,0.0292953866030115,0.05774356544888828,0.0,0.04800653621514685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08889867810499116,0.03987822604230306,0.040299550646638364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10972609958183856,0.05102122590539216,0.0,0.14275640619395416,0.0,0.0,0.06470591085503492
alcoholism,drunkenthrowawayy,2020/03/26,"Negotiating How the hell do I stop negotiating with myself? I'm trying to cut down (not necessarily completely stop) because lately the number of days I drink has been creeping up, and I almost always get drunk when I drink. It's affecting my health, and drunk me thinks it's a perfectly fine idea to be up until 2:30am when I have to work at 9am.

Anyway I find myself by day 2-3 sober having a CONSTANT negotiation going on in my head. One minute I'm thinking ""no I absolutely don't wanna drink tonight, I can wait until the weekend"" and then 3 minutes later I'm thinking ""well as long as I'm in bed by X hour I can drink"" or ""I had an annoying day, I deserve to relax tonight!"" Or ""okay I can drink but ONLY if work out/do laundry first/etc.""

Honestly it's exhausting. It dominates most of my thoughts during the day, and the constant ""yes I'm gonna drink tonight"" and ""no, I definitely won't"" has my head in a constant state of whip lash. It's also really anxiety inducing, not knowing if I'm going to stop at a liquor store on the way home until I'm actually HOME.

Are there any tricks to just shutting my head the hell up? I don't want to argue with myself for hours in my head. I've gone to a few meetings, but I haven't really felt they helped, and generally the first thing I think after leaving a meeting is ""god damn I really wanna drink now.""",3.428165467625899,4.426738830935253,5.536035971223022,80.12937769784178,72.56115107913669,8.437697841726619,27.20935251798561,8.841846274778883,2.00314474820144,1057,37,218,20,20,370,151,278,0.129,0.768,0.10300000000000001,-0.7939,0,0,7,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,1,4,9,14,7,0,15,2,17,16,4,3,1,40,38,22,0,5,9,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,3,0,6,8,10,4,10,12,1,3,8,8,1,2,5,1,28,6,36,30,2,46,2,0,0,0,5,13,3,6,28,132,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.08507533125541596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08729840993154485,0.0,0.0,0.06971800062559648,0.07254093750331372,0.0,0.0,0.059285547801418814,0.0,0.06669263942404523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05314426070122506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09140681535555947,0.282632580743674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22489615150885306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5978240675743044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09722900455993842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370669511748538,0.0,0.07968115332215517,0.14831092286683886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04554807337574115,0.0,0.09909307067188083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3578882811599253,0.0926685106721687,0.0,0.0,0.058435072325830624,0.0,0.17489776336175214,0.0,0.17170993625855582,0.0,0.0,0.09841587115014502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0479119759543788,0.0,0.09834309983545793,0.0923112786408015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07715176257381666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05907558194743276,0.06630449549124541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675496684139077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2186597347315681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05791867282100334,0.22344629182758666,0.0,0.06921136666982833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05918965537033925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05142116003256307,0.06919961084396127,0.0,0.0,0.07838549915917416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269364954939615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Yenthly,2020/03/26,"My mom is an addict and my dad keeps buying her alcohol Hello, I’m 16 years old right now and located in Belgium.

Like the title says, even tough I’ve talked with him about it he doesn’t stop and just does whatever she says. 

Also ironic how whenever my mom is drunk and abusive he gets mad about her and shouts at her for being a dumb alcoholic drinker.

It’s so weird to me how he can’t realise that maybe he shouldn’t buy her the alcohol? 

Any help?

alcoholism,Papaverpalpitations,2020/03/26,"Searching for help Hey everyone, first time posting on this sub. 

I've been drinking since I was 13 years old (I'm 25 now), and I remember the first time I ever drank I stole beers from the fridge at my parents house during summer break and had one beer-and one beer quickly turned to 7. I was completely alone during that first time I drank, and I've been binge drinking by myself ever since. I cannot control myself when it comes to alcohol. 

I started using opiates about 2 years ago, but quit within the last few months. During that time, I wasn't drinking but since I've stopped using opiates, my drinking has ramped up again and I've essentially replaced one substance with another. I've been diagnosed with poly substance abuse disorder by numerous doctors, but have never seen the urgency to stop using or drinking whatever is available to me. My life has never drastically fallen apart, and I've actually gotten my shit together recently. However, alcohol is still that beast that lurks in the shadows of my mind and I've never really been able to completely stop. I know that if I don't quit, my life will inevitably reach that breaking point-I just don't know when or how it will happen. 

I'm getting to the point where I feel regret the morning after drinking, but that regret has never been enough to get me to quit. I realize I need to stop, but I honestly don't know how to defeat this. I've been to AA meetings a few times, but I've never stuck with it. 

How do I stop drinking? I feel helpless at this point and I know I need to quit, but I honestly don't have a clue of how I'd do that. Can anyone share some sage advice, or even personal experiences with quitting? What was the moment when you finally had enough? What helps you stay sober, and how did you go about getting sober?",5.031132478632479,6.080827501424505,5.611755698005697,80.87780448717952,68.85754985754986,8.69900284900285,30.009615384615394,8.959647251330699,2.4285051282051286,1427,54,270,25,24,461,166,351,0.135,0.8029999999999999,0.062,-0.9821,2,1,12,0,1,0,38.0,0,3,0,10,19,8,1,0,10,0,30,18,1,9,7,60,56,27,0,5,12,1,2,0,0,2,6,0,0,1,16,13,13,6,8,9,0,3,11,5,1,6,18,3,33,3,31,36,5,56,0,4,1,0,10,10,1,5,39,172,49,1,0.06855291081699824,0.08122398946321012,0.06689775208111909,0.0,0.0,0.0669891110487965,0.060768019193317126,0.1465244267838322,0.0,0.07100014113023749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188370423002763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047933789177813886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05905226257928596,0.14375284543582822,0.0,0.07688791865358698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06957976145181696,0.0,0.0,0.07856757494194484,0.07016680905675031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700902796445593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14166696444424706,0.0,0.04527855105672726,0.12402006512437448,0.0,0.06550524405609481,0.0,0.06705790105127704,0.0,0.0,0.06932482298715048,0.0,0.0,0.07509636296021333,0.0,0.17493321276200394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10744819945449137,0.0,0.038960199019749835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060621112636006835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189914217458472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910085499282493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15069954788608722,0.05587977195097727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968418965209502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0692188976870223,0.0,0.05471827938120901,0.0,0.0,0.10166222948005058,0.2643611548748336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07193474806160594,0.0,0.13935967959862405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07611989477224422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059857757516367585,0.0,0.0,0.19441397694311954,0.0,0.06565473878787183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3645722949923167,0.0,0.0,0.04391675006697375,0.0,0.06768772914700252,0.0,0.07765708436436015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07036857782184941,0.1701230287021638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048522103116166934,0.0730682816758995,0.054746443131859716,0.2865665151957997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1998687679264852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07456588150500247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17762311337560227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882916539413572

alcoholism,abbahajajaja,2020/03/26,"20-year-old-alcoholic So, with a smorgasbord of mental ailments (depression, anxiety, PTSD) I've definitely added alcoholism to the list. To get STRAIGHT to the point, I can easily down a handle (1.75) of whiskey in about 2 days. As much as I would like to quit drinking excessively, I've tried a lot of things. That will include exercising, long walks with my dog, so much. But I just can't seem to kick the habit at such a young year of age. 
I would like to know, are there people who have drank as much, possibly more than me, at my age, am I just a lost cause? I know that I would cause my family heartache because I succumbed to this. Rehab is so mentally draining (trust me i know)

Am I just a lost cause? Have any of you easily killed a 1.75 handle in a couple days? I'd love answers from anyone.

alcoholism,Itneedsmore_zazz,2020/03/26,"Partner and self struggling *long story*
I have an issue with not being to stop when I start drinking. It only ever lasts one night on the weekend. I have drank all night and until 5am. I haven’t been able to go without for more than 2 weekends without “blowing off steam” . I usually am a rambunctious drunk putting it nicely . My partner has been trying to avoid alcohol and is normally good at this. He can go a month without and normally self control and stops after 2/3 drinks. Sometimes he can go on binges. Right now he is on day 4. He drank the equivalent of 2 handles of vodka and today I came home to his side of the bed littered with beer cans. He also quit his job. I’ve been trying to get him into counseling because he is severely depressed and has been for years, but he always deflect this. “It’s not the right time” “I can’t afford mental health care “ he had gone a month without drinking, but this past weekend I brought home a pint of vodka. I know it’s  my fault for his spiraling. I am ready to admit I am an alcoholic now. I essentially brought home junk to a junkies den. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared, ashamed, worried, embarrassed and feel helpless. I don’t want to tell anyone in my life at this moment and I feel like I’m going to explode if I keep this to myself. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest",1.8202159354926903,4.011399464944657,3.25949979499795,89.57065463987975,80.18081180811808,5.786032526991937,25.166188328549943,6.937597516519254,1.0641889025556917,1049,41,212,12,27,343,151,271,0.11800000000000001,0.797,0.085,-0.8484,2,1,8,0,0,0,27.0,0,1,0,2,5,13,0,5,11,0,25,12,1,1,2,37,49,15,0,4,9,0,2,1,2,0,4,0,5,4,11,13,9,5,5,10,0,9,10,8,0,1,11,2,27,5,37,36,2,46,0,2,0,0,19,12,0,1,26,133,38,1,0.09976737844756862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21324197272642886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07978393649955959,0.08301445106642984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06975967071763108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06081726789431011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11410730261113765,0.1017194914745161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11189759832132788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06434170554939142,0.0,0.08592949686631915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2932021471228717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09024530559603568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10089076843480703,0.07127383509740783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10424867498432573,0.0,0.22680040124756726,0.08368014361061074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10604805795682287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30022444535319714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10413122272058976,0.09900372875017543,0.08867782999834037,0.0,0.0,0.1096590841048629,0.0813237292093893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10201890390933334,0.07046864986942489,0.048741301664542984,0.0,0.0,0.08829099042978791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10054205193730838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15926673928107635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18724985249095832,0.1955016965169392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06760495763612095,0.07587758699962863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523925164238196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002937712746354,0.0,0.1061148875883422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704015921490581,0.0,0.0,0.0998845503859064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2081582683551232,0.11270873999050456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09867248832990673,0.0,0.07061586396506785,0.0,0.0,0.16681999133930958,0.0,0.10429852577363252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0872010861883831,0.0918523979044966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058175160680781886,0.0,0.09456780927492693,0.0,0.0,0.13547100212636254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10987967233093712,0.0,0.058845384692019824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3846887704650154,0.0,0.0,0.10131861563730103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06424692071824452

alcoholism,Urdazzle,2020/03/27,"Advice about roommate that will be leaving detox soon. Hello,

This is the first time posting in the sub.

As the title says my roommate will be leaving detox very soon. I'm looking for advice about how to manage my relationship with her because the last four days have been anxiety inducing. For context, my roommate was admitted to the hospital by me and had a blood-alcohol level four times the legal limit. Over the last four days she has been having auditory and visual hallucinations. The hallucinations were so bad it caused me to flee the apartment in fear. 

I want to be as supportive as possible because I know that alcoholism is a disease but I don't know if I am the person to support her at this time. I'm having a lot of anxiety about the idea of her coming back to the apartment but I don't want to punish her because she at least made the right choice of allowing herself to be admitted into detox. 

If I were to move out of the apartment she would have nowhere to go but I'm not sure if I can ride out our last 3 months of the lease with fears that she will relapse and another incident will occur. 

I gave her an ultimatum which is why she chose to go to the hospital, but even at the hospital when the social worker was speaking to her she wouldn't admit to drinking.

I convinced myself the wait would be to boring without a buzz. I wasn't in a terrible mood or going through anything tough, I was just bored. I'm not craving today, but I'm a little concerned how willingly that beer came to me. I can't get strung out on booze again. I usually smoke and take kratom to get through the day when I feel I need a drink. The guilt isn't horrible, I've been here before and know that guilt doesn't get you far.

alcoholism,emgf26,2020/03/27,"Break up with Alcoholic boyfriend So yesterday my boyfriend and I unexpectedly broke up. He has problems with alcohol and the night prior he got completely wasted and said horrible things to me. He said these things in front of his friend who quickly stood up for me and confronted my boyfriend about his drinking problem. My boyfriend got extremely angry and kicked his friend out of the house. I was very upset and knew I was close to my breaking point with him. 

We’ve been dating over a year and I have had several discussions with him about his drinking. Our last discussion prior to our breakup, he finally admitted he has a problem stopping when he drinks and he asked me if he should start attending AA. I told him I will support him if he starts to get help somehow. But that I was not going to put up with his behavior any longer (trying to initiate fights with random people, saying horrible things to me, peeing himself when he sleeps after drinking, passing out in Uber’s and me having to drag him out of the car)

Yesterday morning, I confronted him about his behavior the night before. He did not remember ANYTHING and felt horrible for doing &amp; saying what he did. This time I told him this was his last chance to try to get help/get better/stop drinking or I would leave because I don’t deserve to deal with that. It took a hell of a lot of me to say that because I love him so deeply and really don’t want to lose him. 

I think hearing me say that I was going to leave him was a huge blow to his ego. If we were to break up, he wouldn’t want to tell people “she left me because of the alcohol” so he changed the subject up something entirely unrelated. 

He said that he wasn’t sure how we would be able to make our relationship work in the future because he will he enlisted in the army in a little over a year once he graduates college. I mean I get where he is coming from, but that is a year away and not the pressing issue at hand. And, with the coronavirus and just futures in general, everything is so uncertain. So many things could happen so I felt like it was a dumb idea to break up based on a uncertainty that we wouldn’t make it in the future. I honestly feel like he just did that so he could “break up” with me and try to make the break up not about his drinking. And also maybe he thought that breaking up with me would mean he could continue to drink and not have to change his behavior?

I’m just completely and utterly heartbroken. He said he “did not want to break up and that he loves me a lot and doesn’t want to lose me” and I said “okay, then let’s work this out, get you better, and see where this goes. We’re already a year in” but he said breaking up now will save us heartbreak later on, which is BS because before this he has said he wanted to stay together even with the uncertainty about the future. 

I just want him to be the best he can be and be healthy and happy. I don’t want to see him face a major consequence later on as a result of his drinking. 

Do guys think he did this to avoid his drinking problem? And do you think this was not a wise decision on his part? Do you think I’ll try to get back with me? Idk I’m just torn to shreds.",4.275260955892783,5.164790597503898,4.947441143100272,85.53940309885124,70.4820592823713,8.572982555665863,28.14072471989789,8.841846274778883,1.9711588143525745,2507,87,525,44,44,807,248,641,0.11599999999999999,0.779,0.106,-0.4555,0,1,13,0,1,0,48.0,7,3,0,6,28,31,5,3,30,1,53,18,4,5,1,115,108,45,0,23,19,0,5,2,2,9,3,12,0,1,28,46,12,2,15,9,0,9,14,16,1,0,34,19,75,15,91,57,5,90,1,4,2,2,98,39,2,9,34,344,103,4,0.05349138283587924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17149806144974694,0.0,0.0,0.059029071106889625,0.04277703952794831,0.0,0.057957890954211465,0.0,0.03637597462607475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04401885031273072,0.0,0.05000722214564648,0.0,0.05025691500295554,0.0411315715747795,0.0,0.16303925243843326,0.0,0.09103445393365067,0.0,0.05613590613019192,0.09461756237443407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131735806722224,0.046078089862381225,0.11216939437454464,0.0,0.0,0.1281255496830408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055147266905053165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4716107171732608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03533055387385163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048074605748611936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027046850398041233,0.038214254586035785,0.10272023218290492,0.05859719525856899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08265461937577606,0.0,0.1676822385380303,0.0,0.06080077115006272,0.0,0.08556389076934116,0.0,0.0,0.052964878910749774,0.04730225318376332,0.056942571697015575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06028867609132413,0.0,0.07170829272986452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06172187390206929,0.0,0.060385260228211016,0.0,0.05583110618309546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0872052328220083,0.0,0.11327930175448092,0.05811854396485664,0.05469856310175422,0.0,0.05226637539899568,0.05361241829204203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11968634965504878,0.0,0.09095292163422472,0.09655612290480453,0.0,0.10711774023103317,0.05423186639105899,0.05373928378916299,0.11653559488899852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10039607837164602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056966576950332234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05792595491405314,0.0,0.0741683793303627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050566646722809284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20473611681955006,0.0,0.053773614169135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03426794956980329,0.0,0.0,0.057429726574545,0.06059530923116028,0.0,0.3561778813623513,0.17015397847195654,0.0,0.0,0.08525141313502695,0.0,0.0,0.060430036887759685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05353001367283732,0.0,0.0,0.04118027985957701,0.0,0.0,0.07572295217974366,0.057014696848091385,0.0,0.08944238247273034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06070138734059018,0.050414995278303266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04675382632669525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1421491915682238,0.1371004729354338,0.0,0.04246618292624396,0.031191255497907,0.0,0.0,0.10222661724506772,0.059430894533886176,0.14526855071589928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06434354733130936,0.0,0.0,0.04413599291040076,0.22085422457379328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788472756762976,0.0,0.0,0.11399623087157565,0.0,0.0,0.13778678704972033
alcoholism,furtimacchius,2020/03/27,"My (22M) girlfriend (22F) is working so hard to beat her addiction. I want to help her but I don't know how My girlfriend is 2 months sober. She's working so incredibly hard to better herself and Im so proud of her. She's been going to AA meetings and they've been really helpful but they were recently all cancelled due to the outbreak

She's been really struggling lately, with all the COVID-19 stuff on the news and having recently started a new job. It's really driving her anxiety through the roof

All I know to do is be supportive and present when she needs me. When she wants to talk, I listen, then when she wants to hear my advice, I give it. The problem is that I can't relate. I don't know what she's going through.

She's strong and I know she can get through this, but it breaks my heart to see her in such emotional and physical pain. What can I do to help her through this?",2.7002930402930403,4.310881703296708,3.794747252747253,89.46691941391943,75.37362637362638,7.270915750915751,26.968498168498172,8.021203637495839,1.5522647619047616,698,27,150,11,15,226,94,182,0.10800000000000001,0.7390000000000001,0.153,0.8675,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,1,6,8,7,0,1,6,0,17,3,1,1,3,24,34,17,0,5,3,0,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,0,9,7,0,0,4,0,0,3,3,3,1,0,4,5,31,4,18,29,3,18,0,0,1,0,27,2,0,0,12,102,40,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15746313955248264,0.0,0.1411470857508635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1104977620915755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12774724277671598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16247784899643788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07546500212117406,0.1385619625152778,0.16417947531519395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2587833856792896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16279667216212704,0.17116450797693972,0.29044935582511977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1560221851262439,0.0,0.1433364328373378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31752626173229465,0.0,0.1629369079228349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11529225498056475,0.0,0.0,0.10710193938528503,0.0,0.13950301832644935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15369651009513016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13821152101238318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27759980049983424,0.0,0.2852381696253254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11510160162148797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10223681643365977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15100217762817472,0.16535157362621236,0.0,0.16391111059900054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609703707181213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25558696537518216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21031104483133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Homeland55,2020/03/27,"Immune system rebound for virus awareness? Hi guys.

I've tried doing research but I couldnt find much. I'm trying to find out what's an average time for an immune system to bounce back after quitting. I've been a chronic drinker for 10+ years but also taking weekly breaks to avoid any serious withdrawal. I'm on day 5 and had mild to 0 withdrawal. mainly sleeplessness. 

basically i'm wondering if my immune system could handle going to the grocery store lol. in probably 5+ years the only thing ive had to fight off was a UTI which was probably my fault anyway

any replies would be helpful",2.77117816091954,5.316795715517241,4.354137931034483,81.06298850574714,78.91379310344827,6.9701149425287365,25.18390804597701,8.07648339933343,1.9154045977011496,477,18,83,9,12,159,81,116,0.121,0.7390000000000001,0.14,0.0772,0,1,1,0,1,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,3,4,1,1,6,1,11,4,0,0,0,12,17,5,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,1,3,2,0,1,3,0,1,1,1,4,0,0,5,0,4,0,14,8,2,16,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,2,7,46,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1656669980859842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817538841048813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592944267426573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16540162221244809,0.0,0.0,0.1336020466996991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3786837647797952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11773466968375447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20512248135822356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13885600459407765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522875584622824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575556761392184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4467103279156968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2203417837009002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557596865359328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13762891324019252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.120797552189069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2812981564289994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16617248095756135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22465783882692236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14716160483921895,0.0,0.0,0.26681046232203764

alcoholism,pilot_1999,2020/03/28,"Needing Some Reassurance Sorry for the long post... I hope this posts as well bc I’d like to get help anonymously. As my name suggests, I fly for a living at college. Also, I’m not yet 21. My story with alcohol has only lasted 3 years. I never drank until prom weekend the last weekend of school. In college I hang out with a bunch of kids who are in Greek life and therefore drink several times a week. I never did. This year in January I met one of my neighbors: he was a college dropout and my Uber driver one night. We started hanging out drinking on the weekends only and he seemed cool. Eventually it progressed to where we were hanging out every day and drinking most of those days. One night he tried to take his life. That really weighed on me and to this day I can’t forget seeing him and taking him to the hospital. I kept telling myself I could do this and fix him because I truly care about people but now I’ve found out the hard way that him being in my life has knocked me down to the lowest point I’ve ever been in. I stopped eating, started drinking more because everything was fine when I drank. I would get sad and tired for no reason and that’s when it started to worry me. I have left college due to COVID19 until August. My last week on campus I would run through probably 12 shots a day which is a lot for me. I started waking up feeling terrible and having to drink to make the nausea go away. I puked twice last week because of the nausea. I’m back home now and I told my mom. My dad was an alcoholic who’s not in my life anymore. It broke her heart to hear. I’ll be sober for at least 3 more weeks simply because I can’t obtain alcohol. I don’t even want to drink on my 21st. I’m on the end of day 2 and I’m doing awesome. What isn’t awesome is the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal: shakes are the easy part, I’ve been hearing voices in white noise and hallucinating a decent amount every few hours, my liver is a little sore and my kidneys too from not drinking any water. I can’t sleep at night. It’s getting better though. I’m scared for my career- this can’t be on my record. I know I won’t let this get in the way of my career in the future like going to work hungover or even drunk but I just wish I could talk to a doctor. The same thing applies for mental health, something that I hadn’t dealt with before. I’d like opinions or someone who’s dealt with a situation like mine to help.

alcoholism,Katya555,2020/03/28,"Is my problem serious enough to consider going sober? I have struggled with some addictive tendencies all my life. In highschool it was drugs and at 19 I started going to NA, I was sober on and off for about a year. Drugs aren't an issue for me anymore (25 now) and it was never severe for me anyways. My biggest issue is my social anxiety, I have aspergers and drugs helped me enjoy socializing more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've now replaced that with alcohol. I hardly feel comfortable in my own skin, but I love to be around people, and when I'm drunk I feel so outgoing and on top of the world. I don't need to drink every day and I don't get cravings before nighttime. However, when I drink I can't stop myself. One beer becomes too many beers every single time. I'm not the type of person who flies off the handle or does anything bad, but it's still embarrassing to me that I can't control my intake. Even when I know I'm too drunk, I will go out of my way to drink more and more and more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my question is this: Is that alone enough to warrant serious concern? Is there hope for me that I could learn to have self control, or is that just deluding myself? Am I a semi-alcoholic? Should I stop completely or can I try to drink from time to time? I've asked myself these questions many times, and I feel like I need the perspective of people who understand addiction.",3.7791014946124406,5.257827959854018,4.8730239833159565,83.36465936739661,72.32116788321167,7.992770246784843,27.64615919360445,8.563005593585519,2.0117078901633643,1087,40,212,19,21,357,147,274,0.08900000000000001,0.8029999999999999,0.10800000000000001,0.8083,1,1,11,0,0,0,39.0,0,0,0,3,16,11,0,2,7,0,23,17,1,2,2,42,41,19,0,6,7,0,5,1,0,2,7,0,0,2,12,14,9,4,8,8,0,3,7,6,0,1,3,5,36,5,31,34,10,32,0,0,0,1,11,12,0,7,17,151,48,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19391684623606792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19010098604420614,0.0,0.092115677463447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19273428736685755,0.2161452194501696,0.0,0.0,0.06803934432477098,0.0,0.08820521343954503,0.0,0.0,0.07319056651349777,0.07917602397651276,0.08314749005490654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07426171734527,0.0,0.09822794652107944,0.07568193181233357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09325256635990023,0.0,0.1995089756945073,0.07101186196013973,0.0,0.0,0.057359353378319884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07783255132642954,0.0,0.0,0.34851185918476696,0.3094287085062565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18379890794913165,0.0,0.05874445231739719,0.0,0.14987264631689914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349131762170953,0.06353920927448871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04646781225792447,0.0,0.15164104196209402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07967334157035208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05961503459685581,0.0,0.0,0.0883381213838803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18566183630807825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04887944842777971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06282140262586915,0.043451902967503085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08027239791069363,0.0,0.0,0.18034369348796805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13189671163922587,0.06859650273552373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060268477841325815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12332047888600325,0.07765953415428788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085104178490225,0.0,0.0,0.19926773827213828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09278448225183536,0.100477604544968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813275589545296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06295264107008122,0.0,0.07102810807875455,0.14871671106782194,0.0,0.09298006550502727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2074480041109865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060384854715392684,0.0,0.0,0.09259034040437594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07059693828304114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2161452194501696,0.057274854582737185

alcoholism,Gumiasz,2020/03/28,"COVID'NT 19 Hey. I'm 29 and am sober for 4 months now. Recently I've been changing my life dramatically from losing many pounds by hard training through voluntarily helping in animal shelter to creating my own company. And I was bussy, and I was in love and it was beautifull. It gave me strenght and I realize that main reason for many of my problems was loneliness. So i started to hang out with people more. But I was so lonelly I fucked up with the girl, becouse I rushed too much. Fine! I'll learn from mistakes (I Hope). I still can hang out with my friends. But not anymore, since I'm locked down due to COVID-19

And it hit me today. That long forgotten craving. To drink couple of beers, to watch some movie, play some games. Who needs friends when you can do all that and be happy?

I was just googling if I am an alcoholic to assure my conscience that I'm not, so I can drink heavy today, coz its only once right? I'll return to my old motivated self tommorow right? I'll be ok to indulge myself just once, right? 

Sitting in my car. Realizing of what I'm about to do I found this community. And I would be a liar saying that reading motivational stories gave me strenght. No. You guys, as a people, gave me strenght. You showed me that I am not alone with this problem. That I can find in me that control I was about to lose, to continue this fight for little bit longer. You too are sometimes sitting in my car assuring yourself that's ok to drink and You find that strenght to fight it back. And God help me I am with you.

Thank you for this community. And mostly thank You for You

alcoholism,radio_fox,2020/03/28,"Tight chest/breathless after night of drinking For the last two week or so I've indulged in drinking whiskey. My girlfriend was away on a business trip and I come home and try to entertain myself out of boredom(drinking with gaming).  Now recently, when I  wake up, I feel like my legs are heavy and I can't breath as well. My chest sometimes get tight. This is making me extremely anxious.  Especially with this corona virus threat.

Does prolonge use of alcohol cause you to feel this out of shape? Like if you drank to sleep. Do you ever wake up feeling this way?",3.731981132075472,6.20316389622642,3.6836226415094337,87.53260377358494,75.13207547169812,6.504150943396226,26.63773584905661,7.554174236665415,1.481376603773585,447,17,84,6,10,136,79,106,0.07,0.845,0.085,0.1663,0,0,5,0,0,0,14.0,0,3,0,0,5,5,1,0,2,0,5,11,6,3,1,19,13,8,0,1,2,0,5,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,4,8,5,2,3,5,0,2,1,1,1,1,2,5,12,4,19,11,0,19,0,0,0,0,5,8,0,2,10,53,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19658719765940064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20781176485251304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1728275993311928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18896788890250146,0.0,0.1584571128612648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16097636809086485,0.0,0.0,0.54060453215326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16639380608058016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27903277927953696,0.13141431144245902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09610657138858043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18451740254266874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14994425181946705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797378964749451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12278842217582113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17262513234464816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1816289786080368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18408339936301968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18193180000019904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12489035029843172,0.0,0.17969296070638285,0.0,0.0,0.15887421578548072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14601138636039915,0.1475540374683367,0.0,0.16539363824734116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,gamblingfinancer,2020/03/28,College Drinking I’m a graduating senior in May of this year. After evaluating it I have found that I consume on average 75-90 units of alcohol a week. I have a great G.P.A. and rarely miss class. I have accepted a dream job starting as soon as this pandemic is over and I wonder if I should seek help during this period before starting. I drink 3-5 nights a week and am fairly physically active. I hope this finds someone in a similar scenario and am intrigued to read the responses.,4.62534954407295,6.1408079787234096,6.217355623100302,74.40500000000003,70.27659574468085,9.626747720364742,31.51367781155016,9.957137785484203,3.3740869300911847,386,17,69,10,7,132,67,94,0.0,0.7959999999999999,0.204,0.9427,1,0,3,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,7,0,8,3,0,0,0,12,15,7,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,6,4,3,0,4,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,8,3,10,12,0,14,0,1,0,0,1,4,0,4,10,45,14,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2381006875131218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18958260419172646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4365096415600542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20363109728763,0.0,0.0,0.2442838219602455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24563288146103715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14933516147390358,0.0,0.0,0.22128625287854525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22109020640154506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2090785319831273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2228558425913673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1887739473220232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3153916753712695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574263043051002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24161227118461656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14347303017347424
alcoholism,grrzzlybear1,2020/03/28,"I'm about to lose everyone I care about over a joke post on Facebook. I posted a joke post on facebook saying how on day 97 of quarantine I'm trying to make booze out of the condiments in my fridge. As we are not under an actual quarantine yet I thought this was self explanatory as a joke. But I've been called out and humiliated in front of everyone I know as if it were serious. I'm getting hateful messages. I've dropped out of group chats. No one wants to listen to me. I'm really struggling. I'm definitely an alcoholic. I've definitely been trying to be sober. It's just so hard being forced out of my job and having to rely on unemployment. I'm asthmatic so I'm high risk, which means finding a job is hard and dangerous. I just wanted to make light of a difficult situation for me and now I'm ostracized. At this point I'm depressed. I dont know what to do. My birthday was the 25th. And this happened the day before. I'm drunk right now because I just can't handle it. I've taken so many steps backwards in just a couple days. Please help me. I feel like I'm alone. I'm probably in the wrong as everyone says I am.

Now I can down about 7-8 drinks without breaking a sweat, but this is too much. Enough is enough. 

I right now have about 500ml of Vodka left. With COVID in the air, i don’t want to go out and get more liquor. I want to safely taper without suffering from withdrawals...

How do I utilize these last 10 drinks (500/50 ml) and safely taper off?",3.982037617554859,6.5349375172413815,4.0865203761755495,84.54688087774295,74.6896551724138,6.97680250783699,26.92476489028213,8.00094639256281,1.8100103448275864,496,19,90,8,11,153,80,116,0.0,0.866,0.134,0.9348,0,1,3,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,0,11,3,0,0,3,0,11,4,1,2,0,16,18,6,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,3,2,0,4,0,2,4,1,0,0,3,1,8,2,20,15,5,17,0,1,1,0,0,9,0,0,5,62,11,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3557209750430593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3752017328790649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1897160747777412,0.0,0.10318520088906304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14799630493349686,0.0,0.0,0.19726636754630655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16067561669342031,0.1524653656944731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18407417939943266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2669361939867709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19575327747133703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17926941097547788,0.0,0.0,0.15505195247449194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2141785572667418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1632449862071743,0.16830870370729098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5250544687115062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,newuser-help,2020/03/29,"Stopped drinking a few days ago and am wondering if withdrawl symptoms are common I am 30 years old, and have been drinking a decent amount for 2-3 years (7-10+ drinks every day for the last year, same amount every two days for the previous 1-2 years).

I tried quitting a few times myself but it never really took. For about the past two weeks I've been feeling this sudden chest pain in the left of my chest.. only happens a few times a day and only lasts a few moments. Four days ago, I binged and in the morning had the chest pain again so I decided to try and stop drinking (attributed the chest pain to that).

First days' symptoms were really bad (no sleep, sweating, weird heart rythems). Next two days weren't actually that bad.. some headaches and lots of brain fog, but other than that nothing much.

I'm on day 4 now, and about an hour ago just had some kind of anxiety attack or something... huge brain fog, very heavy feeling heart beat, a bit of chest pain (same spot I've been having it for 2+ weeks). It seems to have subsided now, so now all I seem to have is the brain fog... 

Is it possible all symptoms are related to alcohol &amp; withdrawl? Sweating and brain fog are symptoms I had before (in previous attempts to stop drinking).. is it possible none of the other symptoms are related to alcohol &amp; withdrawl? I can't really go to any clinic or doctor, thanks to all this coronavirus stuff, so online resources are all I can turn to.

So I guess my questions are:

\- Is it common to have more severe symptoms on day 4 (or 5)? Rather than in only the first 72 hours?

\- I read online that brain fog can last weeks or even months.. does anyone have any experience/advice regarding this?",4.5981857707509874,5.674273972727277,5.095349143610015,84.0865019762846,69.87878787878788,8.163372859025033,28.28722002635046,8.456263369488248,1.9282595520421608,1321,46,260,20,23,422,156,330,0.128,0.8420000000000001,0.03,-0.9884,0,0,8,0,0,0,66.0,0,0,0,5,13,10,1,0,18,0,29,34,15,1,5,39,41,19,0,2,9,0,2,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,16,8,7,3,7,6,0,2,5,8,0,6,9,2,13,2,31,32,19,54,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,13,44,157,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.05948454154430621,0.0,0.0,0.05956577665519097,0.16210220746521686,0.1302874623008217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13209221962449946,0.0,0.08290472876521288,0.0,0.046631391520635404,0.0,0.0,0.042622052087284236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693465746286264,0.0,0.0,0.10179190440144513,0.0,0.0,0.0518693092710199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06654847616628275,0.0,0.0,0.34023687005216435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35380585191838965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06239134109179835,0.05334325616996462,0.0,0.0,0.298569767178678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04026105164391686,0.0,0.10271659902067354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0616426589047481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10369877051974737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034642861756469016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715022068991114,0.0,0.05390344190767452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14446698349048515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005932490908755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06347659108490421,0.0,0.1490625250938324,0.0,0.0,0.06622918249153549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051822854067832935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04865472548520993,0.0,0.04480988352207526,0.0,0.047013245170882415,0.0,0.06482770110460041,0.0,0.0,0.05848919988446258,0.0,0.06396336762349128,0.0,0.0,0.1390800056287351,0.25944714180406864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058189671804595076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13743810597780706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06828499019953528,0.064834512828105,0.060972781081408,0.0,0.11715047199263585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11098462582207327,0.0,0.06886325203586903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06100030734521651,0.0,0.0,0.04692712659012254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15288655222108125,0.0,0.0,0.06978036317085687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3801415219323788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05612035790240548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108820048073232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06772467600186301,0.08277063308280616,0.06630293452601665,0.17863630075482964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050295319350663635,0.0,0.0,0.14668636607225166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06610449134391269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1570153971846975

The al-anon ""steps"" are really God-heavy and I just can't get into it. I saw secular aa but i don't want to intrude on any space that's just for alcoholics themselves. Are there any for family?",1.5315545454545472,3.9348126100000016,3.5314545454545474,85.9357272727273,82.9,7.636363636363638,22.090909090909093,8.575989854853784,1.6500999999999997,391,13,80,10,11,132,70,100,0.1,0.8140000000000001,0.086,0.3334,1,0,2,0,0,0,12.0,1,0,0,0,4,2,0,1,1,0,10,3,0,1,0,16,17,7,0,1,6,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,6,5,2,1,2,0,0,1,4,1,1,0,3,2,9,1,11,14,0,7,0,0,1,1,6,3,0,1,2,47,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4369017533792359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780100304457541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21623744058933198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3853969097382423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21359035609066587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18311016346635356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11233774830258307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18448695151419306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217391111776734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.232720810020096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618990639053729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21787261742852895,0.0,0.17089493635560468,0.0,0.2136924930995155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24587865667443426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12056562515111592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20831006292112386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,midvoliot,2020/03/29,"Day 4 of taper Info
12-15 4.2% beers a day.
35 year old male.
Drinking 10+ years.

Ok. So I'm starting day 4 of my taper. Started at 15 and decreased and am now on 8 today. Yesterday I drank one beer an hour starting at 2pm and had about 10 (extra one because I started feeling weird). 

I had a video chat with my doc and he says I'm doing the right thing by slowly decreasing the amount of alcohol day by day until I'm done with it. He suggested so amongst this COVID-19 outbreak. Basically told me to stay home and I will be fine if I do EXACTLY what we discussed.

My question is did anyone else feel dizzy/out of it the whole day? It was a really weird feeling for me but I made it through it.  

Thanks.",0.3908808724832227,2.449951791946308,2.692881711409396,92.34254404362416,84.77181208053692,5.604194630872483,23.406459731543627,6.9077264865688965,0.7635936241610732,543,21,121,7,16,185,101,149,0.011000000000000001,0.92,0.069,0.7053,0,0,4,0,0,0,21.0,1,0,0,0,4,5,0,0,7,1,11,5,0,1,1,17,25,10,0,1,2,0,3,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,8,8,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,2,0,2,8,4,12,3,16,15,3,23,0,0,0,0,10,4,0,2,18,68,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15584373812493305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10196499043785716,0.14941605874180594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08889422893638498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5642745721367911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14923071641801966,0.0,0.14285404838351098,0.0,0.0,0.12181898343333035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22120215303976065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1462754548807082,0.0,0.14360932095973508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13798416915173578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15301994739122834,0.0,0.1976310606975554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16335859095864635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341992522288152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245346812516059,0.0,0.11596675716507734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4128658188829064,0.15543120563149973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342570682699503,0.0,0.0,0.09688037228304436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13822607918374175,0.13934307507032406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16280961803770055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878144374624144

Besides the easily google-able side effects, does it affect how long your body takes to process alcohol?",6.3481637168141605,7.965458893805312,5.582466814159293,80.19724004424779,66.25663716814161,8.127876106194691,34.47898230088495,8.472884824447931,2.836611504424779,497,23,86,7,8,150,79,113,0.046,0.831,0.12300000000000001,0.7757,0,0,7,0,0,0,13.0,0,2,0,4,4,3,0,0,7,0,8,8,1,5,0,13,14,6,0,1,3,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,0,2,2,7,1,2,4,0,4,1,1,0,1,3,0,7,2,13,10,2,16,0,1,0,0,14,2,0,2,9,48,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4621159694295622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1561724181485656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512629266002634,0.0,0.0,0.1601037534861241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12613529141479646,0.0,0.0,0.564797686451475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12144166930237515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11135991636809428,0.0,0.07530565220686862,0.0,0.16383279825182914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09661201686734597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12755674101959094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15290661727433694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13526284405621178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09767098580334516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15821918184902115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533074798293628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23021604607513646,0.12050501601904973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21674622580209085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16809492947375496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978595859542358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561803596533393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13894295903944112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092819525383854
alcoholism,spark99l,2020/03/29,Did you ever get to a point where you didn’t recognize yourself? I can’t look in the mirror. I don’t have the same hobbies or interests as I used to. I don’t have the same morals or values I used to. I don’t look like the person I used to be. It’s scary. My drinking isn’t enough to get me to stop but not recognizing myself may be.

alcoholism,Alltherays,2020/03/29,"Drinking alcohol is a learned habit that becomes an addiction. Being sober is the same thing in reverse?!!? Our mentality about our lives is very powerful. We think boy this is a time to celebrate what comes to mind... alcohol. Boy this is a time to wash away worries and feel bad formyself... alcohol. Boy I’m happy I just got married... alcohol. 
We have trained ourselves to drink. I guarantee you took your first drink and wondered, why do grownups drink this stuff? We need to retrain our mentality we need to rethink what it means to be celebrating what it means to feel sorry for ourselves and find something much much more valuable than alcohol ever could be. Empowering ourselves to rewire our present moment and letting go of past ways of thinking

We can be the change we wish to see. We must keep seeing that change keep being with that vision. If you falter or fall get right back up and don’t for one second feel down on yourself. ❤️😎",3.4176836158192114,6.071723451977402,3.911666666666665,84.53213276836159,77.19209039548022,6.871186440677969,29.04237288135593,7.984000788550335,2.1691898305084747,749,34,136,13,18,235,113,177,0.04,0.826,0.134,0.9572,2,0,10,0,0,0,25.0,11,3,0,2,4,3,0,0,6,0,17,11,0,0,2,38,38,7,0,6,3,0,3,0,0,1,7,0,0,4,13,14,9,2,11,4,0,4,1,1,0,3,2,5,16,2,22,28,4,19,0,0,2,0,18,6,0,3,8,91,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10973438918734382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5378752798526261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457349660946003,0.07740141918063231,0.08404699592696532,0.0,0.11117119447678876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21297012057655015,0.0867097806364364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08036891532121605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3944343849902482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09105284176887077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15269034406102902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09200152639983047,0.08562144695841634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052590758296347434,0.0,0.057207466115606724,0.0,0.08050709373118714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10715456989361437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17894268006335834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10293179300285082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888473045931522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2192967612012788,0.0,0.0,0.20288345162559845,0.0,0.10163802659176978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14799354113721375,0.14927640757863794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06820990266227586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960914748163965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08596319279234292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604261668389912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749307846387482,0.0,0.11268076358080473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523175509269493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06687411118462155,0.12899788130202675,0.0,0.0,0.1173914513416763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11183709748931306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08305514127999032,0.0,0.07989931820111489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09083010194733296,0.0,0.11575417068888685,0.0,0.10916160666028504,0.0,0.10222523838701987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,3X-Leveraged,2020/03/30,"Need help/advice for a family member with a problem About two years ago my family noticed that my uncle hadn’t been coming to holidays because “he wasn’t feeling well”. He missed Thanksgiving (2017), Christmas(2017) and Easter (2018). After missing Easter, my dad(his brother) went over to his place and found him blackout. It was clear he had developed a problem. My dad, with force, brought him to the hospital where he spent the week detoxing. He lost his license for 8 months. He owns his own business, no employees and needs his license, so this fucked up his life. I worked for him that summer to help him out. He seemed to have got his life back on track until this past Christmas I noticed he had the shakes. I didn’t say or do anything about it but definitely should have. I text him every now and then to check in. He is divorced, his daughter has nothing to do with him, he lives and works by himself. He’s obviously lonely and depressed. A little over a month ago I texted him but I never got a response and told my dad to go check in on him. Belligerent. My dad couldn’t believe it and lost it on him. My uncle says he fucked up, never again, etc etc. My dad checks in on him for the next week or so while he gets rid of the shakes and things seem to be fine. Last week my grandmother was concerned because he sounded off on a phone call. This time my aunt (his sister) and her husband go to check in. Guess what? shit faced. They bring him back to their place to live for the next couple days to detox and get rid of the shakes. He wanted to go home yesterday so they took him home. He thinks he can fight this on his own, but he clearly can’t. I am certain this will happen again.

alcoholism,Gifleo93,2020/03/30,"Cold Turkey afters years of evening binging (doctor is informed) expectations? For about 5 to 6 years ago as a result of an experiment I started to drink a few beers before going to bed. Sleep terrified me because I was always afraid not to able to. I was afraid to lie awake for hours. The alcohol removed this fear and also made me more relaxed and tired.

It has kind of spiraled out of control. My tolerance has increased greatly, I'm always tired and my memory is laughable. The black out's keep increasing in lenght. I've already lost several friends, missed several great opportunities and put me quite a bit of debt.

Regarding the amount, I ended up (calculated to standard glasses) on about 15 to 25 units within a few hours.

People warned me for cold turkey, so I informed my doctor of my plan. Should the symptoms get to severe, help is just a phone call away. But should I really be worried? Mentally I feel little to no challenge. I have a family member checking up on me if it get's too intense. I'm motivated and feel good about this.

I didn't drink yesterday evening. I kept sweating through the entire night. I didn't sleep at all. Just didn't happen, whatever I tried. Soon, night no. 02 without alcohol. At the moment I feel pretty weird and keep feeling from freezing to boiling hot which goes back and forth. Headache, dry mouth, muscle pain, confusion. But it's pretty managable.

Is this only the beginning? Am I in for a wild ride?

alcoholism,Leonr1993,2020/03/30,"Cold Turkey afters few years evening binging (doctor is informed) expectations? For about 5 to 6 years ago as a result of an experiment I started to drink a few beers before going to bed. Sleep terrified me because I was always afraid not to able to. I was afraid to lie awake for hours. The alcohol removed this fear and also made me more relaxed and tired. 

It has kind of spiraled out of control. My tolerance has increased greatly, I'm always tired and my memory is laughable. The black out's keep increasing in lenght. I've already lost several friends, missed several great opportunities and put me quite a bit of debt.

Regarding the amount, I ended up (calculated to standard glasses) on about 15 to 25 units within a few hours.

People warned me for cold turkey, so I informed my doctor of my plan. Should the symptoms get to severe, help is just a phone call away. But should I really be worried? Mentally I feel little to no challenge. I have a family member checking up on me if it get's too intense. I'm motivated and feel good about this.

I didn't drink yesterday evening. I kept sweating through the entire night. I didn't sleep at all. Just didn't happen, whatever I tried. Soon, night no. 02 without alcohol. At the moment I feel pretty weird and keep feeling from freezing to boiling hot which goes back and forth. Headache, dry mouth, muscle pain, confusion. But it's pretty managable.

alcoholism,when-pigs-swim,2020/03/30,"Liver Test Hi all. I’ve been drinking a lot more than normal because of this whole quarantine thing. I’ve probably been drinking everyday but probably only for about 2 weeks or so. I’m stopping today because I’ve really fucked up my stomach (I have GERD) I have pain in the center of my chest which is usually caused by my GERD but I went to my doctor today and she asked about alcohol use.

I go on and off the booze for a few days every now and then and generally feel better, but then something inevitably happens and I get bummed out and drink again, which lasts in in a binge of a few weeks.

Anyways! If you feel a craving I want to recommend drinking La Croix. I drink the grapefruit and orange flavor, they remind me of beer. They are excellent on a hot summer day. 

I hope you are all healthy and safe, stay sober we’ve got this!!",0.01712851405622473,2.3782972891566274,0.8978614457831355,100.94470381526104,94.18072289156626,3.730522088353413,18.964859437751006,5.46131890053228,-0.4868465863453815,317,10,71,2,12,97,65,83,0.04,0.7140000000000001,0.247,0.9507,0,0,3,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,2,2,2,4,1,0,4,1,6,3,0,0,1,12,10,4,1,3,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,3,3,1,1,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,10,3,7,6,1,10,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,4,5,40,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5629504360645229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5700752988145259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14712205093180195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23271351211751096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19502956795294227,0.0,0.0,0.2889966560244419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3101329363715351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1716203339130089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18737370898763125

I've read up a lot on this, but was looking for someone's personal experience, since it's real hard to get exact answers to this. The half life is anywhere from 60-120 hours, I've read, which could either mean I'm in the clear, or still need to wait a few days.

alcoholism,transcend2000,2020/03/31,"I don’t know what to do. I’ve been having 6+ drinks a day, sometimes 10 during quarantine. I (M22) can’t handle being locked up anymore and my house is in the Red Zone in New York, the highest density of cases in the country. I can’t leave or see my friends or anything I used to love that kept me going, so I turned to the drink. But the days are slipping away and so am I. 

I have a healthy and positive vision of who I could become after this, but I don’t know what to do now. I don’t even know who I am, or what’s happening. I am afraid to stop drinking too. It feels like the only thing keeping me going and the only thing I have to look forward to since I can’t do anything else at home. 

What do I do? How do I get through this?

Also— I know I don’t have it as bad as many other people, I have enough to eat, and everyone is still healthy for now so I’m grateful to God. I’m terrified because my mom is working at the NYC dedicated COVID hospital and a quarter of her coworkers are already sick and hundreds of people are dying there each day.

I typically am drinking roughly 8 drinks a day and more on the weekends, and I've been trying to stop for a while. I've gone upwards of a week a few times and have noticed different experiences each time. I dont thinknive had the DT occur but I have had a bit of a panic attack the first time I tried to stop for a few days, but I really believe that it was brought on by me starting to consume a large amount of coffee at a new job I started around when I started trying to quit. 

What have been some of your experiences with the severity of your withdrawal symptoms, and how much roughly were you drinking before attempting to quit?",9.707699530516427,7.04813685915493,9.594929577464793,68.42460093896715,60.69014084507042,12.846948356807516,42.68075117370892,11.20814326018867,4.719390610328638,582,27,107,12,6,192,89,142,0.102,0.889,0.009000000000000001,-0.9218,2,0,4,0,0,0,8.0,0,3,0,4,3,2,1,1,14,0,12,5,0,2,0,15,17,9,0,1,2,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,5,7,4,2,0,4,0,2,1,2,0,1,8,2,11,0,20,8,8,25,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,1,17,78,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.141730144619605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11805966462464307,0.0,0.1508740730293196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11284961076802408,0.14941700597140636,0.0,0.0,0.1447863821230035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17105749146836846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13855937698899246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15542931994174095,0.3897504997087563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2594550607703414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11280626303630395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316046049868815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09749075098734697,0.0,0.0,0.12808494852222702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509884261394104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15560066270229894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821147857881335,0.0,0.0,0.08495958625926582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29964506170164223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2816067536117011,0.0,0.0,0.2217520424864394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378426645407486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2319948694284636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2701202461829298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14606188126197545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10637953701251077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09420924149776816,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,DaeSh1m,2020/03/31,"Why do you drink to sickness? Hi all. I'm not an alcoholic; I maybe drink a beer or two every 2-4 weeks. My uncle was a severe alcoholic and eventually passed away from excessive drinking at a relatively young age (60).   


Anytime I've had enough drinks to feel that sort of nausea or headache or uneasy feeling, I immediately wonder how this is something anyone would enjoy doing enough to actually get addicted to it. Recently, I watched an episode of Intervention and saw an alcoholic who was pounding liters of vodka daily and was just rolling around, groaning, throwing up, drooling, and passing out. I understand addiction to speedy things...In fact, I quite like taking amphetamine, methylphenidate etc...it feels great, you don't feel sick...you feel alert, confident, talkative, cool, cocky, smart. But, alcohol basically feels like poisoning yourself.

**TLDR**: Would anyone be willing to explain the thought process behind getting addicted when being drunk often feels terrible (at least the next day does)? What the purpose of drinking to absolute sickness is?",6.1581176470588215,9.236136511111113,5.977189542483661,71.0679411764706,70.0,9.124183006535947,36.1437908496732,9.627879704456738,4.32224183006536,852,46,124,22,17,266,132,180,0.084,0.784,0.132,0.8529,0,0,13,0,0,0,45.0,0,2,0,1,5,8,1,0,9,1,14,18,1,1,2,30,30,10,0,2,6,0,7,2,0,3,10,0,0,0,5,6,11,0,11,8,0,3,2,2,0,1,6,11,8,6,19,19,4,16,0,0,2,0,5,6,0,6,9,73,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.09998857605041396,0.3350976011264186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4380048158554938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14328826232542602,0.0,0.0,0.09121330857783727,0.0,0.0,0.09626684967420904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06607980720367995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966558517315762,0.0,0.0,0.5018709919729926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21174221266790172,0.1142727224600557,0.0,0.0,0.08632903781538494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626566725978215,0.07319919858649337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10706480789377357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11296521876534553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10011596022666727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10293730830527056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10896998369303726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10898143363475304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10116931351128393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157534097852754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07888060400346149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703901482538622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134374439333919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000909305155915,0.10666702956865644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08218920125463589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09245642895244656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111161620887943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455727770012018,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,lucamenow,2020/03/31,"HELP PLEASE Do I have a problem? I want to drink daily. It’s not an uncontrollable urge, I skip days occasionally, but it’s something I’m always down to indulge in. I drink alone a lot of the time, but I don’t hide it. People know I’m drinking. That is unless I’m at my parents house, I sneak liquor from them and get drunk alone in my room because I know they wouldn’t approve.

Over the past few weeks, i’ve been drinking a good amount everyday. 3-5 drinks. I like getting drunk and altering my mental state. I like to get drunk instead of doing my schoolwork and I find myself pushing off responsibilities to the point that I have intense anxiety about getting it all completed. 

I don’t get belligerent, but I do get drunk. I have only blacked out once in recent weeks, and that was not a pleasant experience. When I get drunk I sometimes say things that don’t make sense or that make people uncomfortable. I’ve had a few experiences over the years where I make people around me concerned for my safety, or where I make them genuinely confused and uncomfortable due to me not making any sense.

I like being loosened up by alcohol. I like forgetting about my anxieties. I like escaping from my responsibilities.

I know this is unhealthy behavior. I’m just not sure how concerned I should be. Should I abandon alcohol? It wouldn’t be the hardest thing for me. I’m a stoner as well and I prefer weed to alcohol INFINITELY. Weed has never done me wrong like alcohol has on many occasions. Sometimes when I’m drunk, I just claim that I’m high to make people less concerned.

A few of my friends are very casual drinkers as well, but don’t seem to have the same toxic relationship with alcohol that I do. It makes me sad to know that I’m doing something frowned upon.

I drank a good amount of bacardi last night, over three sessions. I drank first at 4 pm and then helped my mom with something, again at 6 pm and then had dinner with the family, and then again at 9:30 pm before i went to bed. My family didn’t realize I was slightly intoxicated, although I was very conscious of it and trying very hard to hide it.

Let me know what you guys think. I’m feeling so bad about myself.

This time they came on right away (before it would be a day or two). Anyway by day 3 of sober they seemed to be gone.  However, if I try to do something with  my hand that's 'technical' my hands will start shaking to the point I cant compete  my task.  Example: I was putting some skews in my bike and had to stop, tying my shoes is hard, even using a fork.  Or if I feel nervous they will start shaking.  Otherwise my hands don't shake.

alcoholism,200Kstairs,2020/03/31,"Done with it - today - My story Hi all, I just need to get this all of my chest and since theres no one I can talk to about it I thought I would write it down here. 

30 M. 

Been drinking for the last 10 years on and off. Had a rough childhood and then depressions. No intact family and got fucked over by my relationships over and over again.

For the past 10 years there were only a few sober times. 

I managed to stop for weeks, months and even a whole year and always fell back to it.  Drinking about 4-6 beers each day with some minor interruptions of 1 or 2 days when I was on vacation etc.

Last year I really wanted to stop and got myself checked by the doc. 

I first had a ""lesser fatty liver"" and bad blood levels. I then managed to stop for about half a year. Got myself checked again just to be told liver is fine again and my blood levels are better. What happened next? Of course I thought I can get myself a few beer if the liver's fine again.

Hell here I am again after 8 months doing the same shit. But today was my last day. It's not even that I think I can not make it or get through it. I definitely can and will. My problem is that constant fear of what I have done to my body. You know when you start looking at your skin color, reddish palms . This and that. Checking for symptoms if its too late and such things. 

I never had a problem doing my job or getting life done. There wasnt a single day I skipped job, drank on duty or in the morning. It was always that after work time when I didnt know what to do else. I was functioning. Perfectly.

This will end today. 

What sticks with me is the constant fear that it's already too late. If i look at myself and how I look now,  I will always have that fear of stopping too late with me. I won't even get my blood levels or liver checked for a year and just hope my body will fix itself during my sobriety.

&amp;#x200B;

The only hope I have is that there are people drinking for 20+ years and still get away with it - so I hope I will live through this.

&amp;#x200B;

alcoholism,Noone_special25,2020/03/31,"I'm not sure what to do or if I'm doing it right For the past two years or so I have been drinking at minimum half of a fifth a day. I could go a day it two without any problems if I felt like it. A few weeks ago my fiance of 8 years left me and I kind of spiraled out of control for around a week. I decided I had a problem I need to address. The next day after around 6 or 7 hours of work I realized I was getting the shakes. I have never experienced this. I have continued to drink close to the same amount just to prevent this but I'm not sure if that's what I should be doing. A few days ago I decided to start weening. I made a schedule and figured every other day I would take one less shot than the previous days. Is that a reasonable way to ween? I can't afford to go to rehab and I'm self aware enough to know that I want this to end. Am I doing this right or will I continue to have withdrawals? I haven't gone more than a day with alcohol in quite a while so I don't know the severity, I'm just trying to avoid it.

alcoholism,JLicht12,2020/04/01,"Should I be worried about withdrawals? I’m a 22 year old male in rather good health (besides the fact that I smoke) who has been drinking probably an average of at least 5-6 beers (often much more than this) every night for several months (sadly I cannot think of the last night I had nothing to drink at all). Last night I tapered myself down to 4 12oz light beers, and tonight was planning on going cold turkey. Should I be worried about dangerous withdrawals if I go through with this? Or would it be smarter to try tapering off more?

alcoholism,recoveryinprogress1,2020/04/01,"New to this sub but not alcoholism, its ruining my life Hi there, I am 30 years old and have been struggling with alcoholism for 10 years.  At first the problems didnt seem too bad, but the last few years I have been ruining my health and every single one of my relationships.  Only my mother and a close family friend still talk to me.

Saturday marked the day that changed everything for me.  My fiance who is now ex fiance got in a fight and I ended up swatting her arm.  Long story short I got a 72 hour no contact with her and my 2 year old son (just because he is in the same residence).  

The next day I went to court expecting the 72 hours to be maintained and to be able to go on with my garbage life.  Since covid 19 is here judges and attorneys are hard to come by and I am now unable to see my son until August.  He is the only thing I care about in this world and I am so broken up.  

I am tired of living this way.  I am tired of trying to quit and failing over and over again.  I'm tired of being ruled by alcohol and letting it take over my life.  I dont know what to do anymore....",2.6078560371517057,3.629947004385965,4.028307533539731,90.06942724458204,74.5701754385965,7.46996904024768,23.060887512899896,7.928766900206844,0.8980172342621269,839,22,191,12,17,278,135,228,0.147,0.7859999999999999,0.067,-0.968,0,0,3,0,1,0,21.0,0,0,0,3,10,9,1,1,10,0,21,11,1,0,0,26,32,16,0,2,4,4,1,0,1,0,10,0,0,0,9,17,3,0,2,0,0,3,4,7,0,2,6,2,24,2,33,22,3,40,0,3,1,0,15,13,0,1,23,127,33,1,0.11251916523860034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3607463051304857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11158877711506576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394880304555944,0.06859063876431719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147207879700121,0.0,0.11903035731355613,0.09692529772527664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14513110620121294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13187162366062416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09965858294377193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09480224962532444,0.0,0.10112497043879648,0.0,0.10607305503769104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09570874447151123,0.0,0.0,0.08693202794748517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06394723461027704,0.0,0.17998371052534035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10079507103738357,0.0,0.0,0.11960261101525635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2216174250003827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0618375905847476,0.0917181374023912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11505846986315113,0.23842684198520586,0.0,0.0,0.09935648435235343,0.09957592046452228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10867171093873826,0.11966540873334985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2361398723140416,0.0,0.07624589838456011,0.1711517909434565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10766564508814908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196779824890664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12080347434418033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966320678973161,0.10243322210891898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930770162263408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08985795070647727,0.0,0.0,0.11762946203736575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08460040907653629,0.09043864286856006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07475273364904554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879726846116975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639312724502309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08931247603036202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043063934574608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2898346133116655
alcoholism,Omnicognitionis,2020/04/01,"For those who think its time to curb bad habits.. Not entirely positive on how to start a reddit post, especially one like this.. but I'm gonna spitball it and we'll just hope it works.   


Recently kicked beer to the curb, well, the bad habit of binge drinking beer anyways. To give a quick background, I started drinking a few beers a night while playing video games. Being in my mid 20s, after working all day a beer and CoD was the perfect way to relax. When I first started, I could drink about 6, and I was pretty tore up. That number grew pretty quickly, and soon I was buying 6 packs, I was buying 12 packs, on and on until I was just buying 30 packs. Theres a major problem with buying a 30 pack of beer, you kill any chance of forced limitation.. So very quickly, I was averaging a 30 pack every 1.5-2 days.   


This had gone on for about a year. 12-15 beers a night (Sometimes more..), 100 calories ea. Not to mention my terrible eating habits. I exploded, I used to be athletic, slim, 6'0 175lbs and mostly muscle. I weighed myself this morning, 230lbs of fat. My physical appearence wasn't the biggest problem for me, I really didn't care.. but some of the physical side effects slowly creeped up, some of which I didn't notice.   


About a 2 weeks ago I started noticing I had some breathing issues.. it continued to wake me up throughout the night. My first idea? Drink more beer, more beer = better sleep.. right? Wrong, the breathing issues continued to get worse, accompanied by some heart irregularities. My heart would flutter, randomly pound at around 85BPM.. It finally got bad enough that I seriously considered an emergency room trip. I woke up after 4 hours of sleep early one morning, everytime I would try to fall back asleep I would gasp and wake myself up.. I started doing the mental math of just how much I was eating/drinking.. I could easily reach 3500-4000 calories a day.   


It was time for a change, not just with beer, but a diet overall. On the spot I went and pulled the beer out of the fridge, and stored it away (my logic was if its warm, I won't be tempted to drink it). I spent the rest of that day pretty much doing what you would consider a detox.. I didn't have any withdrawal side effects or anything of that matter.. but was drinking plenty of water and did get oddly thirsty towards the end of the day. From that day on I stopped the heavy beer drinking. Started drinking the proper amount of water, portion control etc.   


The first night of no drinking, it did take a while to fall asleep- but once I did, I didn't budge for 10 hours.. I hadn't slept like that in a LONG, LONG time. After a couple of days, I noticed I couldn't feel my heart beat (in my chest), which was something that had became normal. I used to think I was incapable of getting hung over, when it reality I had just normalized the feeling of being hung over. Throughout the day now, I'm more awake, alert, and motivated. I'm losing about 1.5lbs a day (yes, you read that right). I noticed that my face isn't near as oily, my blood pressure doesn't randomly spike up, overall I just feel stronger (even though I'm not doing any real excersise.. all the gyms are closed here).   


All this can be summed up pretty simple, even though a bad habit isn't technically an addiction, it can still severely hurt or kill you. If you're going to drink, drink in moderation. Pay attention to your body, just because we're young doesn't mean we're invincible.

I used to drink as much as 3 nights a week which was a bit much for me so I made a concerted effort to slow down. I smoke too much pot, I smoke too many cigarettes, I play too many video games, I'm not shy about my problems, but I dont really consider alcohol to be one of them. I dont drink alone, I'm happy to go without, I never struggle with a pressing need to drink, and from what ive seen theres no ways in which my drinking has negatively affected me or my loved ones. I'm a bit taken aback by the diagnoses to be honest. Is there a disparity between the generally accepted idea of alcoholism and the clinical definition? Because I recently slowed down my psychiatrist is jumping fpr joy, and yet for me its not really a huge deal... I'm worried that this diagnoses will take attention away from the issues I actually have. I'm happy to quit drinking if it means I wont have to heavily focus on drinking discussion in therapy, but I'm not sure how much of a difference it will actually make.",5.8230512820512805,5.6950341769230794,7.553846153846155,71.77782051282053,66.84615384615384,12.01025641025641,34.25641025641025,11.602472056035307,4.133479487179486,1026,44,202,33,15,361,145,260,0.08800000000000001,0.738,0.174,0.9839,2,1,14,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,3,12,14,1,1,14,0,18,16,0,6,3,34,37,18,0,4,12,0,1,0,1,3,7,1,0,0,9,6,11,0,4,12,0,4,11,3,0,4,6,3,26,11,34,26,7,28,0,0,1,1,7,9,0,4,14,139,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.15163221701184948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24908711042355286,0.0,0.08046540035214897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07299411801547663,0.0,0.0,0.04736027443366235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08153287874379025,0.0,0.1696389132012999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009695995987237,0.0,0.23656699574825535,0.0,0.08117152242361136,0.08904167332293743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1821087075173552,0.6088680461130412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545879496196913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060024586078203275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08830821916742537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1654089909144745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08770472304625318,0.0,0.08109018138944286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07011999274145342,0.07351397494210436,0.05185996110528858,0.15753482900077415,0.0,0.0846292790338512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2284500075514287,0.057607575601849724,0.05992079966584931,0.0,0.0,0.2187258169105685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15793817073237956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.074340676662494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08263492214768334,0.0,0.0,0.09954286907182908,0.0,0.07671139997807443,0.0,0.0,0.06634847673638612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08122046541534593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14644743374629146,0.0,0.05841465633280059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776949670481119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589371854443606,0.0,0.0,0.1342017513584547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06166823128272619,0.12463954676572198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748922401957972,0.0,0.0,0.07889991786806756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,MrCumsHisPants,2020/04/02,"I posted this on r/ragingalcoholism but maybe this is the right sub for it instead. Pins and needles in hands and feet after drinking a lot for last couple weeks. I need advice from alcoholics. 22M. Not unfamiliar with alcohol, but would not consider myself an alcoholic. Drank every night for the past couple weeks to calm me the fuck down with layoffs happening and virus and whatnot. I do this once in a while, since drinking every night makes me feel great in the morning, but mostly just drink socially.

Yesterday woke up with pins and needles sensation in the fingers, toes, and in the hands. That was the first morning where I had not drunk the prior night, as the day prior I woke up and found I had broken my table and didn't remember shit and slept through a client call I was supposed to be in. That spooked me since it was the first time that had happened. So now I have a broken upside down table in the apartment. As well as broken glass but that's another story.

Anyways back to the point. Pins and needles in hands feet and fingers and toes. Fingertips feel raw, like they were burned. Maybe they were, who knows. Headaches, usually don't get these.. . Is this kindling? My paranoid mind was so freaked out it was neuropathy but frankly I do not have the history of heavy drinking that makes that outcome possible, to my knowledge.

That doesn't stop me from freaking the fuck out and ordering B vitamins. Help me understand his situation and find calm and/or purpose. I hope you enjoyed the tale of how I am one deeply dysfunctional motherfucker. Thank you.

Edit: Actually other than in perhaps a couple locations, it may be more accurate to describe the sensation as tingling rather than pins and needles. A little uncomfortable and it doesn't stop, but, not exactly ""painful"" I'd say",4.506153071500503,7.008766347432027,4.612697885196376,81.64341742195369,72.8368580060423,7.917865055387714,30.066565961732124,8.745826893841286,2.6441539979859017,1435,63,252,29,30,446,179,331,0.113,0.767,0.11900000000000001,-0.1724,0,0,8,0,0,0,44.0,0,2,2,2,11,14,3,0,23,0,25,25,11,3,1,55,44,30,0,4,13,0,7,1,0,2,6,1,0,0,19,21,9,2,8,5,0,0,9,6,1,3,16,8,25,8,39,24,3,44,0,0,0,2,10,21,3,4,22,176,44,2,0.0,0.0,0.09576213446296952,0.0,0.0,0.09589291209711953,0.0,0.3146180123384831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10289937607806512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07545702373438852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10020317686191094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3257417314393161,0.0,0.06328666366381065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3845258273677166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16535994918394373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923641398992147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08969036271739414,0.1669411135792337,0.0,0.10759606410536547,0.0,0.18144187883889315,0.05126962966552366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10819026429170754,0.0,0.0,0.173554625049428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0657754389062494,0.0,0.0,0.0974666666801652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053930475685778766,0.07999022491579125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04794206710315346,0.09835348771358653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08342784512850779,0.0,0.0,0.13100700277226504,0.0,0.19717245206523087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09908478508583504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07276322287682323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2762691399265881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045067860145612,0.0664964066368897,0.0,0.10441877601497837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09367756783595957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09276593419228996,0.11062845945597108,0.09398279805144308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11116379734082124,0.08380371765119675,0.0,0.07803806358770214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10073051786811477,0.1623506903497507,0.11030385546615806,0.0,0.10003264995724788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16408456372338964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034624996743447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05722123459668856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021582947952876,0.0,0.0,0.10807792250641562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15743025159158508,0.0,0.08823195395962634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06970976283484763,0.0,0.0,0.0

What can I say to not lose her? I told her I'm going to an AA meeting today.

alcoholism,waterdoghand,2020/04/02,"High-school Alcoholic I was 17. Had a beautiful girlfriend, a good minimum wage job, hobbies, and good grades. I took a liking to drinking. It started off as a reward to finishing homework, but it steadily advanced into me drinking excessively atleast a few times a week. Almost always alone. 

There’d be times I would show up to school after a whole night of binge drinking, tired and tipsy. My tolerance was strong enough where I’d be good to go by 6am. It was a regular thing. It’s where my weekends went, it’s why I wanted to see my girlfriend less, it’s why I fell into a depression. I was too young to realize how much of a problem it was and blamed on everything else, including my relationship. One night while I was drunk, I cheated on my girlfriend with a close friend. I thought it’d make me feel better; it’d cure my depression, but it didn’t. It went on for about a month until eventually she found out. I got jumped by 3 other grown ass men the same day. Can’t even say I blamed them. 

That was a wake up call for me. And the start of a very difficult heartbreak. I stopped drinking that day. Without constantly numbing myself I realized I loved that girl, and that I took her for granted. I also realized I lost a good friend who genuinely cared for me. The break up was drawn out for months, and it destroyed me. I lost my job, I lost some friends, and I lost my girlfriend. To this day, she doesn’t know the problems I went through with alcohol because I didn’t talk about it. To her, I was perfectly fine during my binging. Just distant. Im honestly still recovering somewhat but I’m a much better person now and grew a lot from it. I got a new steady job, my license, a car, and have real plans for my future. I’m glad I figured things out young, and now know what habits or red flags to look out for.",2.310056561085972,4.389582678571433,3.529799612152555,88.8240239172592,77.98351648351648,6.809825468648999,26.090497737556557,7.827709963407826,1.4919191338073694,1421,56,294,23,34,461,192,364,0.175,0.635,0.19,0.5402,4,1,6,0,0,0,50.0,0,0,1,11,12,31,2,0,23,0,20,12,2,2,1,48,47,19,0,4,6,0,1,1,7,1,4,1,1,3,24,19,7,1,9,7,1,12,5,13,0,1,25,5,47,18,44,17,10,55,0,7,3,2,21,16,1,5,27,192,71,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17669716880227912,0.08278159105762206,0.0856206995491861,0.0,0.06611079195679269,0.06878767010813493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0503945771736076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14622895952180645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441483145652692,0.0,0.08428709379186376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08933639126237533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599450201261194,0.0,0.1424062872684266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3239386606739999,0.0,0.0,0.06905978301735011,0.0,0.0,0.08541972174728782,0.0,0.05460244380274178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07429804152236412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041800197477040335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906428708279068,0.1916108176063593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04698299808344813,0.2773571126155782,0.13223674765921695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734489557776967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08929727678430845,0.0,0.2461102523207431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09086602157652426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04038815575445643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06942158296437362,0.0,0.3609742233014103,0.07028267671602352,0.07461247697311373,0.0,0.05518255211551686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1319720576372677,0.0,0.12154323083566056,0.0,0.0,0.0798427456304611,0.0,0.15515950434506573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05601901191669137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07218384344611234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1582071477416715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940960219295844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08875613524457786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06574212705878453,0.0,0.1673319524188882,0.0658769108379982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11702783533298194,0.0,0.06601999213186473,0.06911542740015049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644663542464324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10984392251424052,0.0,0.0,0.0656303712369286,0.0964105335875822,0.09501646166370288,0.0,0.0,0.18369777561482792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06821101874522195,0.04876062971664768,0.0,0.0663125090962752,0.0,0.0,0.22990644304338756,0.14919278183330476,0.09229757610787072,0.0,0.07969047526398812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05872606103784068,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Perkymufc87,2020/04/02,"Unsure Hi I'm 33 years old. Dad left when I was 8. I was a troublesome child and teen for my mum and step dad. I've drank since I was 15 and had a few arrests. I used to play football at a good standard all my childhood through till I was 21. I had a son when i was 18 and am still with the lady i had him with. Since had a daughter with the same woman and got married. Worship her shes amazing and so are my children. Done a great job with them and get compliments all the time on our parenting and how great they have turned out. Not to be a misery and perhaps 1st world problems but due to early fatherhood I stuck a shit unfulfilling job out to pay the Bill's and make sure my kids and wife have a secure family home. I binge drinked heavily from 18 to 24. I then took up mma and like an addiction I was all in. Training 7 times a week, no booze, competed a couple of times and was fighting at a weight of 70kg. I then stopped because my daughter was on the way and I was neglecting my family to train. Since then I have piled on the weight to 115kg. It's been 5 years since I last fought and I feel like a shadow of myself. Despite  having an amazing wife and wonderful kids who i love.  I binge drink all weekend and eat shit. I'm depressed about the weight i have put on and feel empty all the time. I want to quit alcohol but am not sure where to start. Living in the UK life revolves around booze and I feel at the end of a week if i had time off and didnt drink I've wasted the weekend. Yet when I drink I develop severe anxiety the day after and feel shit about myself. I want to quit but am not sure where to start.....sorry about the long explanation. I just wanted to give a background to my issue. Government lockdown has really shown me I have a drink problem. How did you lot quit? Thanks in advance for any replys.",1.4786493506493519,3.2419834623376644,3.0438961038961065,92.83155844155847,79.31168831168831,6.27012987012987,22.168831168831172,7.225922671290522,0.582563636363636,1423,43,322,18,35,468,196,385,0.14,0.7120000000000001,0.14800000000000002,0.2711,3,1,6,0,2,0,34.0,1,1,2,5,15,25,5,0,31,0,31,19,3,4,8,63,54,35,0,6,8,9,7,2,0,0,3,0,1,5,2,28,13,3,5,8,2,4,5,9,0,0,23,7,45,16,45,30,8,55,1,2,0,1,27,19,3,3,33,204,47,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08926357461432463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08750706233823581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055682635459131664,0.0,0.0626395819314256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728924284926666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04991456780130407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906009855804384,0.0,0.052807180185697015,0.0,0.07052493224325046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08379381655939629,0.0,0.4010664229301265,0.0,0.08378582959022418,0.0,0.0,0.07252323618710227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15438231201674374,0.0,0.16560819898441995,0.05849658818299805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04278001738539183,0.07854877093675187,0.0,0.06867882011953164,0.06548859497442835,0.18055060734880815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08213442197169725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08546363815211519,0.1625106981086496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06674483968157215,0.0,0.0,0.08896514059834659,0.0,0.057835748358285664,0.0800069154992824,0.0,0.07230339393317826,0.07246308130300347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06961323279117325,0.07390179161277237,0.0,0.054656937184532815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08592148928449952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09092038130736732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15670022144244294,0.0,0.08231412589983557,0.0,0.2612750753845492,0.0,0.0,0.05245576959632836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925034655261442,0.25215239511678605,0.2709348751299104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09166030650904017,0.11591314282178762,0.0,0.06539115036435611,0.06845710154876877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2315187289918006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753860359344635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2387305532368641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09097402528339016,0.0,0.08906421112692921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07071984376503257,0.0,0.0,0.1448885511812893,0.06499419921773678,0.13136176219746507,0.2991310137648996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08879764395921702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10545877482654388
alcoholism,maria2918,2020/04/03,"You can turn your life around Hello everyone! I just wanted to share my story, well..my family and I’s story. In hopes that people going through the same can change their life around. My dad was a committed alcoholic. Since I can remember he would drink atleast 4-5 days a week. The most he went without drinking was maybe a month. I came to terms that my father had a disease. When I was younger I resented him for all he put us through. I couldn’t understand why he wouldn’t want to change his life for us.. for his own kids. Alcohol took over his life. He hasn’t worked for over 15 years, he works 2 weeks then gets paid and quits because once he gets that first check he has money to afford his liquor. He goes months without working and is on and off. I worked as soon as I was able to. At 15 I would help my mother by atleast paying for the things I needed. Because she was the only one putting food on the table for us. I am 21 now. My dad was getting worse and worse throughout the years and my heart hurts knowing that I couldn’t do more to help him fight this disease. My mother put up with him and loved him despite everything she has gone through. I never had the father daughter relationship with him because growing up I saw him as this mean bad guy who just lived with us. I acted like he was just not there, I ignored all the name calling. The only time I would speak to him is if he came to me while sober and tried speaking to me. That or trying to stop him from arguing with my mother. My dad was constantly told to stop drinking but he couldn’t stop. It seemed impossible for him. I don’t know what it’s like to live with this disease, I don’t know if he was actually trying to stop but just couldn’t because the disease took over him. I don’t know what was going on in his head. I don’t know what demons he was fighting. The days he would stop drinking.. the withdrawal it was scary. Seeing him argue with people who were not there seeing him all shaky and scared. Then one month he went on drinking nonstop. My mother told me he would fall and couldn’t get up on his own. He was constantly drunk so she didn’t think anything of it. Little did we know that was a symptom of the internal bleeding he was going through. My dad threw up a lot of blood a day after he kept falling. In that moment he was terrified. My mother was terrified. In that moment he begged God not to take his life yet. In that moment he knew he came to a point in which his body couldn’t take it anymore. He was sent to the ICU. They had to intubate him to take care of the  bleeding. He spoke to my mother and my sister over the phone before that and he reassured us he would be fine. They also reassured him he would be okay because they didn’t think he would end up leaving us. My heart hurts knowing that it was his last conversation. That I didn’t get a chance to speak to him. His blood pressure dropped, and all that blood loss affected his brain. The doctors weren’t sure why he wasn’t waking up and he couldn’t get an MRI because he was so unstable. On the 6th day of being in the ICU he was stable enough to take an MRI. The MRI revealed extensive damage to the brain. My heart sank. There was nothing reversible the doctors could do. They said there was a great chance he would never wake up from this. So we faced the tough decision of taking him off the ventilator as his brain was also swelling and pushing in his skull. I was with my dad the whole time, I told him I loved him that everything was going to be fine. I reassured him that we will be fine. That he was going to be fine. I didn’t want to worry him because some say they can still hear you. I told him to rest. On March 14 he passed away. He was 45. Seeing my dad die was one of the toughest things I have ever done. My whole body felt numb. It felt surreal and still does. I’m glad I was there with him in his final days. But I also wish I could have spent more time with him.. I wish I spoke to him more. I wish so many things. I wish I could of done more for him. I miss him so much. I just want to hug him one last time but I can’t. Alcoholism is a disease idc what people say. Please get help if you need it or know if somebody who does. I hope anyone who is going through alcoholism finds strength to turn their life around.

alcoholism,badboyfiko,2020/04/03,Hi. My mother is an alcoholic. Once she starts drinking she’s almost unable to stop by herself. Since I was like 16 I used to watch her so she doesn’t go and buy a drink and that was the only way she was able to stop. By now I have my own family and it’s really difficult for me to stay there for 2 or 3 days until she’s totally sober and withdrawal symptoms are gone. But I am very scared to ignore it because I don’t want something happen to her. She doesn’t want to go to rehab.

alcoholism,star1133,2020/04/04,"Anger/Drinking &amp; My Dilemma 
Husband and I have been together 4 years. 6 months ago he spiraled and got fired. Never happened before. He went into a suicidal depression and drinking all day/night. Found another job a month later so I thought things would get better. And they did for awhile. Except the drinking continued. The last 3 months have been a ball of misery. He drinks all day/night. Sometimes drinks throughout the night and can’t go to work the next day because he feels sick. 

 3-4 times a week he starts fights with me and truly says the nastiest meanest shit and doesn’t remember saying it the next day. I’ve tried ignoring it, staying positive, talking to him, crying, silent treatment, you name it so far I tried it. My kids (from previous relationship) are 16 &amp; 18. They stay away from him and always ask me about his drinking and anger. Very few times he’s said things to them drunk. I’ve been asking him to get help, go talk or see someone and he says he knows he has a problem and needs to change, but won’t do anything. Now I’m at the point that I want him to move out, but we have stay @ home orders and he says he’ll go to a friends house then says he won’t. I don’t want my kids to feel this way anymore and I’m tired of fighting, the anger and the constant blame that it’s all my fault. The house is mine for 10 years now. So he needs to leave. I’ve asked him to leave even for a few weeks to get his head straight and he won’t. 

His fam lives in another state and not sure what they could do. 


I’m really stuck and could sure use some positively and good suggestions...... I’m so confused.....",1.4332634338138917,3.742611941896026,2.271451288772393,95.41805504587158,82.4862385321101,5.57200524246396,21.2694626474443,6.868970318607317,0.3516211271297513,1263,39,277,15,35,394,177,327,0.171,0.753,0.076,-0.9793,1,0,6,0,3,0,53.0,1,1,4,2,8,15,5,1,17,0,21,10,2,1,6,52,52,26,1,8,5,1,3,0,1,5,2,6,1,2,11,22,6,1,6,7,0,5,8,10,0,0,10,10,26,5,26,35,6,43,0,1,1,0,49,8,1,3,24,138,37,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06643002144221483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0623563020890723,0.1623954871290965,0.0,0.0,0.15716279966787902,0.0,0.0,0.0743206037676927,0.0,0.0,0.06166945105927159,0.0,0.21017708891609774,0.0,0.07040884389632464,0.0,0.0,0.04568288870590655,0.0,0.06376864413409206,0.0,0.0,0.06627857259722876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792768614455344,0.0,0.0,0.08098380120081197,0.0,0.11966740399450153,0.0,0.08231835989441574,0.19332107972157372,0.0,0.06454593864230232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44047756563560203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04949733688047537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578409727102985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08216813022857833,0.05789866123494551,0.0,0.1174595829918742,0.0,0.12777083525010952,0.06285633702094423,0.0599365741807513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06626942700649563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07691033002271203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050230878562602416,0.0,0.07517119396472031,0.0,0.0,0.17294200347569533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07436664747623697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0411852086438659,0.0610863164237831,0.0,0.15870183582591274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0661736251279813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17944980867376514,0.0796496396336732,0.0,0.1111345107817143,0.0577985506848812,0.0,0.15939963958919573,0.2109790804744987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.070842771293413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07170771071125061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04800865138191457,0.0,0.0,0.08045779676603608,0.08489270915764288,0.0,0.07128535118483731,0.2979775247810681,0.0,0.0,0.059717686999014925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692510296728086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06349664158211453,0.0,0.07411783624584217,0.0,0.05304310381047946,0.2396290474616753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08197248433806414,0.0,0.14126062184180022,0.0,0.0,0.12046828929743054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09957396149890246,0.0,0.0,0.05949419785020309,0.08739653992503757,0.08613280806898459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10175903862980416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06472432586970486,0.0,0.061833565288576635,0.0884034174114323,0.059484092524103076,0.12022511717554685,0.0,0.0,0.06947037452158236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0545574039402789,0.0,0.0,0.05323541263747245,0.0,0.0,0.0965181446154162

Any helpful tips you guys have would be greatly appreciated.,5.33640625,5.777522328125002,6.321875000000002,78.23562500000001,67.90625,7.65,30.0625,7.1686216300943375,1.8273875000000004,255,9,47,2,4,85,49,64,0.0,0.841,0.159,0.8746,0,0,3,0,0,0,4.0,0,1,0,3,2,2,0,0,4,0,5,3,0,1,2,8,8,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,3,2,0,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,2,1,0,3,3,6,5,1,12,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,11,27,4,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2293911370991907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459665394237418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182647810067198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4152864506973383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21027121777357888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3651553029774969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366478088568845,0.0,0.21253313938859847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14387258960561433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1749650172334615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14327777251460394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33109622608418043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283022841687089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4069183383589338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15247825429394193,0.0,0.0,0.13822489081534464

alcoholism,couchmovies,2020/04/04,"My story.. Dad died of alchoholism, got busted shortly after for a OWI, and my health has gone south...
 It started around my early 20s, when i was able to hang out at bars. It started out as just on the weekends, but later on I became a barfly. Hanging with friends, meeting new ones, and becoming the best tipper from what a bartender told me..
 I'm 34 now, necrosis of the hip, rash over my chest that wont quit itching, teeth ruined, and lack of a social life. All because of alcohol, and my lack of self control. But, I learned to quit.
Alcohol ruined my life, killed my father, and ruined my relationship with the only family I have left. I cant even call what family I have left, just to say hi, or even for help. Worst thing is lack of trust from family.
 Been sober off and on now since 2016, and its not easy. Sometimes I can go a month, some times not. Its a uphill struggle, life issues doesnt help, but we all have our own demons...",3.383330786860199,4.6231040213903745,4.1957563025210085,88.77161764705883,72.95721925133691,6.840183346065698,24.052330022918266,7.1686216300943375,0.8293303284950344,720,20,151,7,14,231,119,187,0.188,0.7020000000000001,0.11,-0.951,0,0,2,0,0,0,40.0,2,0,0,4,8,9,1,1,10,0,11,12,5,1,2,29,18,13,2,3,8,2,0,0,1,1,7,1,0,1,8,13,3,1,1,2,0,4,5,6,0,1,5,1,18,3,26,12,9,29,1,3,0,0,15,13,0,2,12,103,26,1,0.13400735011094494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2864262060621033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929495280682605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816896368163773,0.1480005897747496,0.0,0.0,0.14063244634494634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13683648738322646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15030063802569038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390784723831074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17702118178971982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3789906100075743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10353374627611137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07615946526864521,0.0,0.10717791968812997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14244354670173334,0.0,0.0,0.17964460405131974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398688573132387,0.0,0.0,0.1482592780570321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29119875599151257,0.0,0.2839600633545891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10696338835386092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12942513378980394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09080684857265638,0.10191862836184128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850666242675257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438737431683821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1065680234694146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13979889208281004,0.0,0.0,0.11085226480551977,0.0,0.0,0.13660361749457425,0.0,0.0,0.13253669581879438,0.0,0.18970218428114524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14009357845107548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902852886097783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07814076350825483,0.0,0.0,0.1280497657898339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ThrowawayNotGarbage,2020/04/04,"Shit. I think I'm addicted. Been drinking Everclear mixed with random stuff for 2 weeks straight. Well, I fucked up. I've never been addicted to alcohol before this. Had a lot of crazy shit happen in my life and I've now been drinking Everclear mixed with whatever sweet drink I had on hand for 2 weeks straight. Had maybe a day off each time.

How bad are the withdrawals gonna be? I have some Clonazolam (a research chemical benzodiazapine) on hand that could help with withdrawal. I noticed tonight I was feeling extra cold, anxious, shaky, etc before I drank some.

Are there any tapering guides? Should I just drink a tiny bit just enough to not feel bad? I'm usually pretty commited and can control myself when tapering off something like this. I'm very stubborn and will usually just push through any withdrawals as I did with kratom (shout out to /r/quittingkratom)

This seems like a totally different beast though potentially.

Thanks everyone. Pretty scared over here, especially with the coronavirus situation. Want to get this over with as soon as possible and stop drinking.

It honestly could've been more than 2 weeks, time just kind of gets away from you when drinking. Note that I would only drink at night and usually would feel fine-ish during the day.",4.9397171969224365,7.598652711790397,4.688184653774172,80.8732168850073,72.1004366812227,8.728716988978999,29.682054481181122,9.362217197678863,2.9401102516115616,1017,43,179,25,21,311,142,229,0.133,0.708,0.16,0.4112,1,0,9,0,0,0,32.0,0,1,0,1,14,15,4,2,8,0,19,17,4,2,3,40,35,12,0,5,5,0,5,2,0,5,4,1,0,0,8,13,9,3,5,7,0,1,2,8,1,0,10,8,13,7,31,18,10,32,0,0,0,1,2,13,3,6,20,108,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1941126756533755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09514648098304927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12108752537755794,0.0,0.0,0.10057907314417652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364704359640716,0.0,0.14867342298828987,0.0,0.0,0.15151672036605082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719819866299133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09985522619777924,0.14216714840164352,0.0,0.0,0.11483455691579038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930178767762487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6105116646319164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09199225981826656,0.09929249196213454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0850724154965395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13504942002055295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230722144366806,0.09302947674967653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0787293377247261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05967523760507544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09271151897308147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06288484362601666,0.08699156685938378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07569050946234153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944305900367065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06866577579467653,0.0,0.0,0.08354905134912798,0.0,0.0,0.1013617636169882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677116732338789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10036846144543607,0.0,0.181151960433422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913501739158508,0.0,0.0,0.08104998288944444,0.0,0.0,0.18277696622989534,0.0,0.10007396215296832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06853999423808074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07443344727410166,0.0,0.0,0.10191857113766706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819672817572327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0570471209585977,0.08747197044496334,0.0,0.10382874907091556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29416340564261145,0.07345944976785579,0.05251246932256093,0.0,0.21424458337735344,0.0,0.08004907157526424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12648936228284893,0.0,0.0,0.0

Is it a mental addiction, not in like say thc, until you cross that physical line (shakes,seizures,vomiting,hallucinations). And I’m not hear to argue the difference of alcohol and cannabis, I’m just saying I crave thc just as much as alcohol and the only difference is weight gain and a shitty morning.",7.756050135501352,7.636576054878052,7.849593495934961,71.24066395663958,62.84146341463415,11.679132791327914,36.514905149051486,11.20814326018867,4.21559701897019,699,30,123,18,9,227,116,164,0.065,0.899,0.035,-0.5535,0,0,6,0,0,0,19.0,0,5,0,1,4,2,1,0,9,0,11,13,1,0,2,25,18,14,0,4,9,0,1,1,0,0,7,3,0,0,4,10,8,0,0,3,0,2,4,1,0,2,4,6,9,1,25,13,4,19,0,0,0,0,9,10,0,4,7,80,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4302666348323238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.421799926778789,0.1317405339444853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08946680390484411,0.0,0.10064471889900854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10116320693002276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2749089839019198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257761729251789,0.1525703777030544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22169364665266586,0.0,0.11823961748177292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06873581673902256,0.0,0.07476982714088926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482801551571017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06427464290244783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13258374857171454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09671335089755706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234622075260208,0.2578060351553973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000589775436453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24873759743785515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20924707560505434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10882960704159672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10506573869072497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09891839735137738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12851714755765306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10553125693683398,0.16020731017065284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12682126095232804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,jgutierrez0417,2020/04/04,"Alcoholism. Be strong. Remember.... In this life sometimes we forget who we truly are. We turn into something we would have never expected but there is ALWAYS a way out, a way to succeed and a way to pull yourself back to that heartwarming, person that you lost. In my situation I LOVED to go out have fun with friends and drink. For others it could be something completely different. Some of us don't realize the things we are doing until something bad happens or you end up hurting your health. But it's never to late to help yourself and think what is more important in life. A future. A family. Support. Love. And much more. I have recently learned to put the partying behind me, put the drink down and enjoy the memories in the moment and the people whom you love and cherish because one day we all won't be here. Unfortunately it took me a while to actually process this because to me my priorities were not all there. But now I know my new chapter will be so much better. 
Thank you to all of those who have stood by me and loved me no matter what!
The journey begins and I want to enjoy all of it with all of you.

I've tried searching online about what happens to your eyes when you quit drinking and an answer to my question but nothing seems to address it.

alcoholism,Marmun94,2020/04/05,"Blackouts I really dont know whats going on so i said i will ask here.

Im 25 year old male, with 80kg (about 160 pounds?). So i have this totally random blackouts and im going to describe it, so maybe people will relate and give me a tip or two.

Last few times i drank, i always got blackout drunk. Even if i have mindset i will just drink 1 cup of wine, i get fucking blackout drunk. I mean its not black and white like this, but for reference let me describe yesterday. I had dinner with my family. We were not like ""yeah, lets get drunk!"", it was dinner with some wine. I didnt want to drink, i didnt want to get drunk, but yeah i will drink a cup of wine with my family. And that is what i remember. I drank a cup of wine. But after that i dont remember any fucking thing. I dont know how much i drank, what we were talking, nothing. Even in the morning my parents told me that they dont know how i got drunk that fast since i didnt drink a lot. I even puked at the end. 

I assumed for a lot of my blackouts that it was because i had empty stomach, but that was not the case yesterday. I might mixed some alcohol. I mean i had like very small glass of strong alcohol (dont know how to say that type of alcohol in english) before dinner, for disinfection purposes (atleast we are joking like that in family, we dont get hammered with that shit).

I dont have drunk or middle phase last few times. I say there are 3 phases of drinking: sober, drunk, blackout. I'm not even drunk, just straight to blackout. 3 or 5 years ago i was drinking every weekend with my friends and this shit never happened, but now all the time.

So yeah if anyone can relate, please explain me wtf is going on.",2.07185418719212,3.553525937142858,3.51289655172414,91.37300000000002,76.77142857142857,6.541871921182268,23.497536945812808,7.237678284180719,0.7544167487684725,1298,40,289,15,29,427,155,350,0.11,0.7929999999999999,0.09699999999999999,-0.5435,1,0,13,0,0,0,53.0,4,0,1,1,17,11,4,0,9,3,34,32,3,3,3,56,63,22,0,4,16,1,0,4,1,5,3,3,0,1,20,15,27,0,11,20,0,3,15,4,0,1,19,5,44,7,29,37,9,29,0,0,2,2,16,9,4,12,21,182,64,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06143649418940288,0.2222043900939049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05766899524938966,0.0,0.0,0.04713115231466791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04846108198673496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647927107935259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04224891796816484,0.0,0.05897517191407407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5685912039188334,0.40736698279216654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061385451010049163,0.0,0.0,0.18310654030382648,0.0,0.05839415610897455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960094794999095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05354643408671974,0.1281464520267614,0.14484023601180934,0.06648561183615616,0.11816633514482253,0.0,0.11086231530397864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06128797159520959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14972695608275033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15235730933726765,0.11298894814557055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14174225353095035,0.0,0.1354396425216274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784470511297115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06962822015310803,0.15099133230802184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07352379896047942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05094863651173623,0.0,0.05345384882039291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665019578394512,0.0,0.07272606199724592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07695724716640485,0.0,0.0,0.048048763216445516,0.0,0.0,0.07607829880303922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04439985367506942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15702269304317432,0.0,0.06592685007134004,0.11023145302284207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14228532638905014,0.05733148566789509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05570635982608329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04604450649142516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12124044748237255,0.0,0.0,0.06622583061371637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677028908177912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05718555243680268,0.08175815575861625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08926290105137231

I’m glad I finally did because it had to be done.  I always knew it would be an ugly mess of a split.  He took it too far tonight.  When I came back from a few hours of walking around after not leaving the apartment for almost a week  he decided he didn’t want me to go outside after I left and changed the locks.  When I came back, he didn’t let me in and I eventually had to ask my sister if I could sleep on her couch.  I knew this has to end but it still hurts so bad.

alcoholism,just_plain_sam,2020/04/05,"Fuck. Trying to taper off. Withdrawals are fucking me up beyond all repair. Might go to the ER. Advice? Been tapering off for two weeks.  Quit Xanax two weeks ago also.  The first week I thought I would die.  Tapered off the drinking from ""every minute of the day"" to ""wait as long as you can and keep to a minimum"".  It's still a lot.  

The withdrawals are horrible.  I can't eat without puking.  I can't sleep for days at a time.  Nightmares.  I tried Benadryl last night and had horrific halucinations.  Auditory and closed eye.  

If I can get through tomorrow I can get vistirol prescribed for free.  Don't know how much it will help.  It did when I went to jail.  

I've kicked a couple times but this seems different.  I'm sick as fuck.  I'm laid off from my job and running out of money.  No idea what to do.  I'm actually quite surprised I am not suicidal like I have been in the past, but every other symptom is magnified by 10.  

What the fuck do I do?

alcoholism,BergTheVoice,2020/04/06,"Anyone else feel like the only way to have a good day is to have a few drinks? My alcoholism feels like it’s been a lot worse these last few days... 21, my left hand started getting the trembles, I’ve had a few drinks today and my hand is still involuntarily shaking but not as bad as to when I’m not drinking. Had a huge sense of anxiety this morning along with extreme trembles in my left hand but now that I’ve had a few drinks my anxiety has eased and the trembles has reduced.

For people who have stopped: if I try to quit cold turkey tomorrow, how long will the anxiety and trembles last until I’m okay?",5.659400921658987,5.289659870967744,6.1637327188940105,82.4227419354839,67.2258064516129,9.02119815668203,32.23041474654378,8.418075326091056,2.242393087557604,480,18,101,6,7,156,77,124,0.141,0.6859999999999999,0.17300000000000001,0.8553,0,0,5,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,1,4,10,0,5,10,1,12,8,3,1,0,15,18,11,0,1,5,0,5,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,5,5,5,1,2,4,0,1,2,6,0,0,4,6,6,4,12,13,5,19,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,2,15,62,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15539336120438094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337025008268951,0.0,0.0,0.10167031912831302,0.1489842573410771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12140681757860758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187547953399764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5697648428369043,0.0,0.0,0.12146693554687946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470419300771592,0.20775423637487855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07596793351607226,0.0,0.0,0.1219585301661064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2370484096718481,0.0,0.0,0.3159651771684904,0.0,0.0,0.14207474444718082,0.0,0.0,0.1286785485196195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236178422481086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058679614708694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008052831192244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15465575416836175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10291816677161336,0.0,0.11612034933663198,0.12156480658504155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13782661599945353,0.0,0.0,0.09872021955615802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11541545111174713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14817977085073392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hi all

New here and am 33 F. I have decided to stop drinking as I am very scared right now. Last weekend I drank 3 days straight. I am usually a wine drinker during the week but with this quarantine went overboard over those 3 days. I ended up going to the bathroom and had black stool. Ran to urgent care next morning and they said could be Gastritis or maybe ulcer. gave me some acid blockers. Havent drank since Tuesday afternoon. Black stool is gone but now I have yellow/light brown stool and is still making me nervous as I've gone down a Google rabbithole. Did anyone ever have any of these symptoms--i have no other symptoms really. Please I'm so scared. I am done with drinking.",2.7950000000000017,5.4825664710144935,3.1327826086956527,88.98830434782612,79.94202898550725,5.998840579710145,24.417391304347824,7.3011,1.1995443478260863,575,21,108,8,15,177,99,138,0.096,0.795,0.109,0.2012,0,1,4,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,1,0,6,5,0,3,4,0,16,7,0,1,2,17,28,10,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,4,6,5,2,1,4,0,5,2,3,0,0,11,5,10,2,11,15,2,26,0,0,3,0,6,5,0,2,16,61,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18686663626985034,0.20956484005142986,0.11728266690694833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12059210644064212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17584039054075667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13769991796521522,0.0,0.0,0.22245236321689316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17649240549346046,0.0,0.3379016765296533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275351970343856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15600520166238216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09801629597254692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11560019899335085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14058265625514207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11512226935940227,0.0,0.17326509008351149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665685568442486,0.183419348648406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18931567210138564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11048601601174544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14728486191736367,0.16405448238393608,0.0,0.34533673132343434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14266550268017988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13773142100060626,0.1441891421294553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1792580156296351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1899467271717824,0.1423023577602637,0.0,0.0,0.13834167216656473,0.0,0.0,0.1598775364605421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20956484005142986,0.0

alcoholism,halfemptyteacup,2020/04/06,"I need to stop drinking alone in my house It seems all anyone is doing during the lockdown is drinking. My friends are almost showing off waking up and starting to drink. I've used this as almost a licence to drink like a mad man. 

Yesterday my girlfriend and I joined a video call with our friends and just chatted shit while having a drink. She went to bed at about 9pm and asked me to go with her and I didn't. I wasn't done drinking despite the fact it was my third day on it and I'd been drinking since midday. 

She asks me not to drink all the alcohol in the house and I take this as some sort of challenge and I set out to drink all the alcohol in the house. I don't know how far I got and I'm too embarrassed to check. I think it was maybe half a box of wine, half a litre of rum and some ciders. Probably the most I've ever drank in my life. 

At some point I tried to make food and I somehow managed to slice my fingers up with a knife. It was sore but nothing serious. I was too drunk to dress the wound and my girlfriend came in to see what the noise was about and saw me bleeding quite heavily. I saw her and I just started crying. 

I can't moderate my drinking. My first drink I can nurse over an hour but as soon as I start to drink I have an indescribable urge to just drink constantly. Like I need the alcohol to be going down my throat. 

What if I needed stitches? Medical professionals have no time for drunks. If I had walked in pissing blood during a pandemic because I was too drunk to use a knife I would have died from shame. 

My girlfriend isn't angry with me. She just kind of accepts that this is what I do on a weekly basis. Get absolutely paralytic drunk until I fall asleep then spend the next day throwing up. It's 6pm here and I've only just sobered up from last night. 

I'm lying here and I get a notification from my bank telling me a payment has come out for a beer subscription service. Impeccable timing. 

I don't really have a question. I just wanted to write this down. I've told her I'm not drinking in the house by myself anymore but she doesn't believe me. It isn't the first time I've made that promise.

I wish I could have a glass of wine or a few beers but it's always, always more. When I get to a point I tell myself to go to bed and stop drinking but then I just ignore myself. I physically cannot stop once I start. It's so grim and depressing. 

I don't want to stop drinking entirely. I still want to do it in social settings, I don't have trouble then. When I'm with people I can moderate. I can only drink as fast as the slowest drinker and I want to stay somewhat sober so I can continue to have a conversation but when I'm alone I don't have to deal with any of that.",1.0153176995418391,3.0634981625874147,2.7380250783699083,92.99772727272727,82.23426573426573,5.763009404388717,21.925006028454305,6.953978226594392,0.49114072823728,2127,69,477,26,58,702,249,572,0.133,0.8170000000000001,0.049,-0.9928,1,3,25,0,0,0,41.0,1,0,0,4,24,18,3,2,34,0,45,42,7,5,5,87,87,45,1,12,18,0,1,2,5,1,8,0,2,1,20,29,30,5,5,29,3,9,15,10,0,5,19,4,72,8,74,65,10,72,0,2,3,0,26,25,2,14,37,317,92,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15550550433327606,0.09713789344926198,0.1004693710715328,0.0,0.0,0.0807170928248517,0.0,0.0,0.032983838021397954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04810213941605083,0.033914563936827326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09068788573267456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029567099432185776,0.0,0.0,0.054646494886258265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04952718834465143,0.055474737341130426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04178121048244757,0.0,0.05241472617713825,0.0,0.03872585702137854,0.0,0.05327848568774838,0.06256110053879149,0.05000466757570295,0.04177573353705113,0.0,0.0503386620639673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04963561170911865,0.0,0.8077493708816498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04387391963221709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08251359122175116,0.05865025979124765,0.0,0.0749469012235531,0.0,0.07602275749113889,0.0,0.0826964558807544,0.0,0.03879243845185567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047765880001544254,0.2238647142340702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05050861705185431,0.02665608926239059,0.03953658016846104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034259243298499144,0.04739242529849101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04589489889491609,0.032376261431869856,0.0,0.048727981864632126,0.0,0.0,0.04886186939104117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10789352065006616,0.0,0.0,0.05158370154226874,0.04551696581375251,0.0,0.04654012681119295,0.0,0.0,0.051654323109638065,0.0,0.07377773573752529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033626010509539776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917023998358981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05229465121755759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054334682462149064,0.0515891216621598,0.0,0.0,0.031072390762160368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0386507692349965,0.04415548998836805,0.0,0.0,0.04978783594240282,0.04012234676909096,0.0,0.0,0.04944290241291178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1373232533216247,0.05169795572511048,0.03873471673649181,0.1622033820979056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03646836874875168,0.0,0.0847878661832404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03107889093312365,0.0,0.0,0.0848478147680646,0.0,0.0,0.04634688443879925,0.0,0.03293048774411283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08378238035649113,0.0,0.0,0.11443377189108828,0.0,0.03890633992806123,0.0,0.0,0.04496295066395911,0.0,0.0,0.05577628422394207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03445528037639343,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,scumble_2_temptation,2020/04/06,"When is it a problem? Not a burner. Maybe it should be, but screw it.

My (34) SO(35) of 5 years drinks. Not every night. Sometimes once a week. Sometimes less. Sometimes more.

The problem is that I don't think she can put the brakes on it when she does. She becomes tempestuous, she can barely make coherent sentences, and she stumbles around. Then, we almost always get into a fight, but since she's so far gone, it's not a productive fight.

I've found myself altering my own behavior to keep us from getting in situations where we'd be drinking. I basically don't drink at all anymore, because I'm afraid it'll give her an excuse to drink. Whenever she says that's she's going to the liquor store, I feel a sense of dread and anxiety. If I see her crack a beer, I try to go to bed before she hits that incoherent stage. I count drinks. If it goes past 2, I peace out for the night.

We've talked a little about this when she's sobered up the next morning. She ends up feeling terrible and self conscious. It usually ends with her in tears and me feeling like a mega jerk. Sometimes she makes an effort to stop drinking for a while, but it never lasts.


I can't help ponder if I just anxiety about her drinking and I'm just making it out to be worse than it is. I know so many people who drink more, and a lot more frequently, so a part of me just thinks I'm the one with a problem. Is 4-6 drinks once or twice a problem? Am I the one being a jerk? I've never asked her to quit. I feel like that's not fair, but I have asked her to keep under control or I tell her to cool it now and again, but it seldom works.

I'm typing this out from my car, with nowhere to really go during this quarantine business. We just got into a fight... and I just couldn't handle it. I couldn't understand what she was even trying to say and she just kept getting angrier. I needed some space and alone time and we've been living together for 3 years now, so I hopped into my car and pulled over at a gas station just to clear my head.",1.7221658462703502,3.5559593669064777,3.1779862425848786,91.82332923135178,78.83213429256594,6.212015650637385,21.765051117001143,7.1686216300943375,0.5356992805755398,1564,45,345,19,38,512,210,417,0.14400000000000002,0.795,0.06,-0.9869,2,2,10,0,3,0,56.0,4,0,0,4,22,16,6,2,26,1,22,13,1,4,4,80,55,31,0,11,21,0,4,2,0,2,0,2,1,1,23,24,11,6,11,11,1,8,11,13,0,3,6,8,51,3,43,39,9,53,0,0,1,1,39,20,1,8,26,224,74,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716617076660826,0.07411944446668521,0.0,0.0,0.05954756176272138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10949359635835484,0.0,0.07097295052515623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06370775392222222,0.1338066644326515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04362517573329961,0.07903758651869798,0.06089628710945165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802658942092794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06262674958916646,0.0,0.0,0.6309554327158159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12677016200978794,0.0,0.0,0.04726780816428276,0.0,0.06029634472464573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14474104658844347,0.10225166926979087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07846699765365119,0.0,0.0,0.11216880312820657,0.06865137948086114,0.1220156014489471,0.0,0.05723682664465901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0734460266851091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047968308629489885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12721998377329938,0.0,0.0,0.03933008650718173,0.05833478057929657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06992579325597728,0.07172662823514525,0.06319293956435867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084174716221196,0.0,0.0,0.14330997510852134,0.0725553713682591,0.07189635820886689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053064316861596725,0.11039021402479544,0.0,0.07610986833243091,0.13431724251652444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15242813575345784,0.09698818310758016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749759413301448,0.0683166020681368,0.04961395083927607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27391100430183185,0.0,0.07194228791097453,0.0,0.07611786552144452,0.0,0.0,0.04584617813330066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11382224068038845,0.0,0.0,0.05702779888745017,0.0,0.07465758781792609,0.0,0.0,0.05919905781250263,0.08044171912808934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2831172653736957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05983129208181486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05752099352476898,0.0625507004970002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09171153779647848,0.0,0.0,0.04172995098073931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717546478410106,0.0,0.0,0.07450137460560792,0.086083520307241,0.0,0.0788184043927264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05740488411431871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05209995256144012,0.0,0.07293054132558119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09217063849456496

How can I start kicking the sauce, and getting generally better??",2.5647107438016548,4.155712619834713,4.2447024793388435,86.18159917355374,75.69421487603306,8.145785123966942,28.62892561983471,8.841846274778883,2.2426654545454543,461,20,98,10,10,155,79,121,0.096,0.7859999999999999,0.11800000000000001,0.5699,0,0,2,0,0,0,20.0,2,0,0,4,2,3,1,0,6,0,9,10,3,1,3,24,23,8,0,4,3,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,8,4,0,2,2,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,3,11,2,16,21,4,14,0,0,0,1,4,9,1,2,5,59,15,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4286480308421594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1988889791559588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17736774158860116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21672032696806826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20955531726985005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2131723442464356,0.0,0.0,0.1344225914882269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19749863992168196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11021552151416222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17747800165676292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17049809672021746,0.1810017191988457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14870324161696638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21330668172974807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1825706805254336,0.0,0.0,0.20585886584630053,0.0,0.0,0.20069207859710272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14194837277029468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332346788713816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11694071176941782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3548638846735463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29200156686020484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,OGKebabEater,2020/04/06,"Get Sober on the beaches of Reddit Nation  

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

alcoholism,bri_maine,2020/04/07,"Is my boyfriend an alcoholic or am I overreacting? My boyfriend (30's) admits that he enjoys beer but denies that he has a problem. But I think he does. When we first started dating he would come over to my apartment and drink a six pack on a weekday after work. But when he does that he does not appear drunk. I have confronted him about it and he has slowed down (as far as I know I don't see him every day) but he gets angry when I talk about it. But still when he has a bad day at work he says ""I need a beer"" and goes home to drink beer, not just one, 2-4. In college he got a DUI but does not drive after having more than 1 drink. At a party at his friends house he said he wasn't going to drink because he had to work the next day.. he ended up getting so drunk that he fell multiple times while we were walking home and fell down the stairs in the middle of the night.. that next morning he didn't remember leaving the party. I almost broke up with him that night. I am 6 years younger than him and I don't act like that. When we go to weddings or parties he is usually the drunkest one there like he doesn't know when to stop drinking. His mom has came up to me before and said ""don't let him drink anymore"". There has been days where he drinks beer instead of eating dinner. We have been together for years and I love him but I'm embarrassed by his behavior. I'm not a big drinker at all so am I overreacting or does he have a problem? I can't see a future with someone who drinks so much that they're slowly killing themselves.

alcoholism,Broken_Skull_,2020/04/07,I fee guilty I’ve been abusing for 18years straight. I was drinking close to 4 litres of rum a month and bit by bit getting worse and worse as the years rolled by. With where I’m living we have been on lock down for weeks and I am an essential worker but my hours made it so I could not make it too the liquor store before closing (they have reduced hours) I can’t go on the weekend and still be able to hide it so I have been cold turkey for sometime now. At first it was hell I was itchy and irrational and sleep was impossible. Now though I’m starting to feel great and think I might be able to put this in my past. My problem though is I just feel so guilty that these are the circumstances that lead to my sobriety. It feels wrong to feel good from this when people are losing their life everyday due to this pandemic. I just feel super conflicted how can I enjoy this when it comes at the expense of the world?,2.558457446808511,4.293535324468087,2.989308510638299,94.55875,76.07446808510639,6.402127659574468,22.388297872340427,7.1686216300943375,0.4750255319148939,723,20,162,8,16,223,116,188,0.175,0.728,0.09699999999999999,-0.9246,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,1,0,2,5,15,8,1,0,8,0,20,4,1,4,0,30,34,17,0,2,4,0,5,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,13,12,2,1,6,4,3,4,2,4,0,1,8,6,18,4,23,22,2,31,1,1,0,0,3,11,1,1,16,107,31,2,0.28428629165960523,0.16841638438910236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12095334776378157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31036700098828424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12244373391809225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11348973565205292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13924616845241386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3593592272760354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209068872289704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07426392695408063,0.0,0.08078322546515793,0.11922292678616278,0.0,0.1567133200867442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799647321721154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10039990757182288,0.0,0.0,0.12551500195086904,0.0,0.0,0.15902182137496715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13449928146164267,0.09488165360100967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15079141503034746,0.0,0.0,0.11345730287663434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13569171652674894,0.09854415982722067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13601179370796151,0.0,0.14289312175926774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14224579990977113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1405832058165024,0.0,0.1006096502250908,0.0,0.11351569987346714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910795883590656,0.2793098381552208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11401865764228353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2897120184585026,0.0,0.15541121596002844,0.0,0.09153552556829517
alcoholism,wellfluckit,2020/04/07,"Is losing attention span a symptom So I'm certain I have a dependency problem already. I want to quit, I'm just scared to quit. 

I'm just wondering if my lack of attention span is because of alcoholism or not. I cycle through social media all day, can't focus on a 20 min tv show without checking my phone, and can't even watch facebook videos as short as 1.5 minutes... instant gratification only. Is this something everyone experiences? I know I'm depressed (not diagnosed but I'm pretty sure) and that's probably mostly from alcohol.

I'm working up to quit with you guys.  I'm here every day and reset my counter every day. I'm just not ready I'm scared I'll have nothing left.",1.7732462686567168,4.405187873134331,3.9672947761194015,81.53586753731345,84.44776119402985,6.633582089552236,28.524253731343283,7.865858978985527,2.3355985074626875,541,27,98,11,16,185,86,134,0.124,0.8059999999999999,0.07,-0.7163,0,0,3,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,0,5,6,7,0,2,3,0,7,4,0,1,3,26,19,9,0,4,10,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,2,4,2,0,4,3,1,0,6,5,0,0,0,1,8,2,13,19,3,10,0,2,1,0,4,6,0,5,4,51,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315415310129158,0.0,0.0,0.16284737517518313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08995741864900894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2855116947750645,0.0,0.1271019891478119,0.14978063739102984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09746871929296907,0.0,0.24866850089314985,0.1410096413447914,0.0,0.14435196315699073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1461176899000926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811007176007239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16033544414992046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1650932965752617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14159757811667592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11223377991369436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15013193654212004,0.15910562493528854,0.14120474285987875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4708771882485418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29548700975019143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1504292256256533,0.0,0.11360674254839948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13908315846058958,0.1533819319166051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08704072197885201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422523979309316,0.16003357706076804,0.10743285649587657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,ChikaraGuY,2020/04/07,"oh my god i fucked up hey guys, im sorry to come on here like this

i’m 19 and i suffer heavily with ocd, particularly related to health. i have been drinking heavily on and off since I was 15. it was always just something i did. it is the only thing that takes my mind off the anxious thoughts (weed makes them worse). now its a serious problem.

as someone who is severely (and i mean severely) affected by hypochondria, i have been having an insane crisis since COVID began. i am terrified and i do not put that bluntly. for the past month i’ve had visions of myself intubated or going into cardiac arrest. for the past month i’ve been afraid of becoming a news story for fear porn and that being my legacy. i was able to stay off booze for the beginning, but since then, I’ve been on an 8 day bender.

i didn’t think this could actually happen, but all day i’ve been feeling lightheaded and having pains all over. this made me panic and i came on here earlier and saw that it may be symptomatic of alcohol withdrawals, and what do you know, it was. i took a few drinks and they weren’t there anymore. i don’t even feel drunk right now, i feel fucking normal. this is scary to me. i literally have developed a physical dependency as a result of me binging for a week to assuage my fears. i’m really ashamed of myself. i don’t want to do this to myself at this young age.

at the moment i feel trapped. it’s like, drinking is the only thing that helps with my OCD NORMALLY, and it feels like the whole world is in a thought loop so i did this. i wanna get out of this. i wanna stop drinking for good. this fucking stupid liquid has fucked up my relationships, friendships, career opportunities, made me overweight, etc. and now I’ve drank so much in so little time that my body doesn’t want me to stop. please help me get out of this shithole, guys. i don’t want this to be what defines me",2.6926089389941623,4.5683764459102925,4.1450275845526505,85.80057008075478,76.09762532981529,7.232461821380028,24.677460622051647,8.101407402915765,1.4270872471416012,1479,50,302,25,33,490,196,379,0.177,0.7290000000000001,0.094,-0.9868,1,1,6,0,0,0,45.0,0,1,2,1,11,19,5,5,17,0,38,17,1,6,2,56,72,21,0,9,5,0,5,3,0,1,4,0,0,2,29,19,9,2,10,5,0,5,7,14,0,0,23,6,42,5,46,44,6,45,0,1,1,5,10,20,4,3,22,206,71,1,0.08852454879405147,0.0,0.08638718980330963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09460582062643436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07365951615039816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000075426262605,0.08779256514784692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09776840912245707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09833081727920588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012485006115085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625606028683643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07067964890395527,0.0,0.0,0.11418202103792782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3468814246818485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872827231303374,0.058469629583567176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19922945736572326,0.223803358676758,0.06324195534651159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.327358075578102,0.09250084605776328,0.0,0.050310541128686964,0.07425019150968054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17530644223169212,0.0782819661417677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940974557735505,0.0,0.0,0.11867227807850105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956217035864174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04865077690025495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297458689792877,0.08872485412505716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16752813700595134,0.059090823724416326,0.0,0.0,0.09642918549747563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938455876983535,0.0,0.1413189005479047,0.0,0.0650757291287595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17347052455356354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13465381685364325,0.09419636136163348,0.10386448433025693,0.0,0.0,0.1690133971708155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717337115278757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08470603769444958,0.0,0.0889916221824637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056711092758091775,0.0,0.0,0.09504223601726183,0.0,0.07559948098020296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20001508525252104,0.0,0.2196852646496559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07500656292018089,0.06815052257980947,0.0,0.09909598476338327,0.0,0.0943553904484503,0.0,0.14802097331745465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06655944367709668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1176235533452662,0.05672295640261349,0.0,0.1405572069088427,0.05161937629737495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09835403095076213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15664221741211015,0.0,0.0710090533241197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09883449733466544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902140780849231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Treleeorne,2020/04/07,"Tips for sleep??? Bloody hell, I haven’t been able to get any real sleep in weeks! Any tips on what or how to get back to regular sleep patterns? I’ve been sober for a week now, before that another week, and so on!  I’m regularly a 4-5 times a week drinker but the best part about this Covid 19 shit is that all the pubs are closed. I’ve been exercising, eating right, not drinking. But I can’t sleep for more than a few hours at a time... it’s really starting to get under my skin lol 

Maybe just some reassurance that I’m not gonna lose my mind... that this will pass... I need something to look forward too here man lol

alcoholism,xxxyyyzzzf,2020/04/08,I don’t know what to think The other day one of my friends told me he thinks I have a drinking problem which I don’t agree with. Like I’ve been drinking a lot lately and like have been consistently trashed every night since Thursday but like also the world is on fire? Like I am bipolar2 and I think I’m just spiraling right now and like it’s not like this all the time I think. I told myself I wasn’t going to drink today and then it’s all I could think about and now I’m drinking right now. I just like can’t stop once I start and I feel like I don’t want to start but I do anyway and I don’t know why. The idea of never drinking again terrifies me I love drinking games and happy hours and drunk bonding sessions and just like the fun times. If I stop drinking how will I have fun and be happy ? I am 24 and I don’t want to give up my life again because I am already bipolar and have an eating disorder and was in an abusive relationship and the list just goes on and on and it just doesn’t seem fair to have problem on problem on top of that.,2.410642894325875,3.437661995575226,3.535413846954712,93.39368297761585,75.06194690265488,6.202602811035921,23.913586673607497,6.2272716619740125,0.3751658511192089,825,24,192,5,17,267,109,226,0.11699999999999999,0.622,0.261,0.9883,0,0,7,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,14,18,0,0,10,0,24,12,0,1,3,50,44,23,0,7,9,0,2,9,1,1,2,0,0,0,8,18,9,2,10,9,0,1,10,3,0,1,6,2,26,15,17,35,3,31,0,0,0,1,8,11,0,3,28,125,34,1,0.0,0.10469074527076216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09750614770451224,0.07066051110682414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05386271249672321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07054732263189477,0.0,0.0,0.056984124863654464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012668551390751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6059059896684971,0.0,0.09041312485129407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07444611112541327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04467687091124575,0.06312355390679597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06826580000488952,0.0,0.0,0.08476182510042088,0.05021634985218597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18811919965706336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08701563261479392,0.0,0.0,0.09974634519193944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711938606085953,0.0,0.09967259008933227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0624104429443499,0.38850887720772775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511950336271304,0.07974727879998819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06814776399778158,0.0,0.0,0.08291876073175193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09409925249003703,0.05987421866492975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536423537510823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09486429816703923,0.0,0.15091588762025426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08043854514205177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07309132347168545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12508164572825264,0.0,0.0,0.14774384880014862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830837990867651,0.0,0.0,0.10304546924551307,0.0,0.0837538235238103,0.16886126536500454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10423263481462236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07973008570733857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,danknugsukco,2020/04/08,"I'm 23 years old and don't know how to get help due to the COVID-19 pandemic Around 3\\4 years ago, I slipped in to deep depression after the death of a number of many people I loved within a short period of time. This resulted in my recreational use of drugs turning in to serious addiction, which resulted in me being hospitalized twice from use of ketamine.

Since then I have made substantial recovery, mentally, physically, socially (regained a lot friends), and also my career is going extremely well. However, a few months back I realized that I had replaced my usual addictive habits for alcohol.

I always drank in excess, but when consuming benzo's, ketamine and other substances in excess daily, alcohol did not cross my mind as being a part of the problem.

I now realize although I have made a lot of progress, my relationship with alcohol is extremely unhealthy. I think in the past 2 years I have maybe not drank 20 days in total. I regularly drink alcohol in the day, I have regularly felt the need to drink alcohol to elevate a hangover, and in trying to quit alcohol thinking that I could easily I have faced physical and psychological symptoms (sweats, shaking, depression, sickness, unable to sleep etc) which has always resulted in me buying more alcohol and feeling very guilty about it. (I have spent thousands of pounds on the stuff over the years)

I spoke to a doctor to arrange sessions in the hope to get a prescription for antabuse, but now that the recent virus outbreak has occurred I don't think that it is possible.

I don't know what to do, I feel stupid saying it but I can't stop. I really want to stop drinking, I wish it never fucking existed, but I can't stop. I'm functioning and I am doing well (self employed &amp; in university).. but I know deep down I am killing myself.

The fact is, if I keep drinking as much as I do now for the next 20 years, I will be extremely lucky to live past 50.

What do I do? I would really appreciate any advice.",7.710241935483872,7.376564056451618,8.317225806451614,68.56083870967744,63.005376344086024,12.386236559139789,37.95483870967742,11.792908689023552,4.7294361290322575,1567,72,274,46,20,525,200,372,0.10099999999999999,0.785,0.114,-0.0079,2,0,12,0,1,1,53.0,0,0,0,2,11,14,3,1,21,0,32,24,3,8,3,54,62,21,2,8,8,0,3,0,1,2,13,2,0,1,15,9,13,4,11,4,2,3,8,8,2,2,9,5,39,6,50,47,8,53,0,2,0,2,8,21,1,5,29,194,54,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16592604674311506,0.0,0.07436654068537207,0.06746032752125135,0.5693134453238509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06085918959884563,0.12664685245065174,0.08245709177763551,0.0,0.051752350350582135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06774741292599129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058518170976570534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06076170150049723,0.0,0.0,0.0981597105619156,0.0,0.13109404653027107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07789419472487985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2982061443347973,0.08825480843606619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08487447101068804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07695948174957555,0.0,0.07307039190933802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0587966489420597,0.07035559026008667,0.0795208929849499,0.0,0.04325083853407055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05100994167916957,0.0,0.0,0.07558701341551842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06764345187596739,0.0841962069166801,0.0,0.12547192988172093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06719995459109235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12939934982386378,0.06868553148650752,0.14402016438313658,0.0,0.07715605089586301,0.07645525022586118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669348079288381,0.0,0.0768418910244821,0.0,0.06074433719343021,0.0,0.05594413794587515,0.05642908381995643,0.058694985712859235,0.0,0.0809359357411194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07985683471032587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08241165615271898,0.14529700907871068,0.0527599327783839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08579420158562102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07281987187958411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08094444002565301,0.0,0.0,0.0975064970856512,0.0,0.07514209674829596,0.0817056686666351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06051981010780911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07939156725152162,0.0,0.0,0.06295282391134957,0.0,0.07615752018592899,0.07757697592265232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1908754429881923,0.0,0.0,0.08711922362441543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909969881035672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14629034235207322,0.0,0.0,0.04437601463591055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05166864261955431,0.08277773169199297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314563544303717,0.08381621796117378,0.06279258196239691,0.04488726153551488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13685068166963146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08751418802561642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05406107501224853,0.0,0.0,0.2450377670419427

alcoholism,Astaroths_artistry,2020/04/08,"Stopped drinking for 2 days, it screwed me up. I can't find anything anywhere online that's been genuinely helpful, so I'm posting here in hope that someone who has been through the same thing can help me. Because I have no idea why this is happening all of the sudden. So here's my story. 

I'm 33 years old, and I've been a pretty consistent drinker for a long time. I only drink beer nowadays because liquor is too much for me, and I was getting out of hand. So for the past year or two it's just been beer. I drink between 3-6 beers daily and sometimes a few more on the weekend. Mostly 16oz coors lite, and the occasional IPA. Typically I don't start drinking till around 5 or 6 PM and have the occasional off day on the weekend when I drink a little too much the night before. Well this past weekend I did just that. I went a little hard on Friday, and decided not to drink Saturday to give myself some recovery. Everything going normal as usual, spend the day laying around relaxing. Then Sunday rolls around, and about half way through the day, hours before I typically start drinking I start feeling kinda crappy. I think maybe I'm coming down with something, and maybe I'm just dehydrated. So I decide I probably shouldn't drink. Then half way through Sunday night the shakes start, and I wonder if I'm having an alcohol withdrawal. I have one beer left in my fridge and it's too late to go buy more. I drink the one beer and feel slightly better for about 30 mins and then right back to feeling sick, realizing that I am in fact withdrawaling. I decide to try and sleep it off and go to bed. I sleep great and wake up Monday feeling energetic but notice the shaking is still happening, and I'm having some trouble focusing. It continues to get worse as the day goes on and around 5 or 6 pm I decide to go get more beer to try and feel better. I get home and drink about 4 beers and I feel normal as can be and go to bed. Fast forward to 4am and my eyes shoot open and I'm wide awake. I toss and turn till 8am when I finally get up because I can't sleep. The sweating and shaking sets in again and worsen though out the day. I'm starting to worry at this point. 6pm rolls around and I feel horrible. I decide it's probably safer to drink than not at this point and just try and taper off over time after reading about alcohol withdrawal online. So I drink, everything feels better again except I'm exhausted from getting no sleep and feeling horrible all day. Cut to Wednesday and here I am, only slept about 5 hours before I started to withdrawal again, it's happening faster and I'm now considering going to the ER. Terrified because I have no health insurance and am out of a job currently because of Covid. I have no idea why my body is detoxing so quick and sending me into a withdrawal after 6 or 7 hours of not drinking. I used to go at least 14 hours or more with no booze and never had an issue. I don't think tapering is going to work at this point. All because I took an extra day off of drinking I feel I can't go back.",3.19871753246753,4.7446275405844185,4.465129870129871,85.44090909090913,73.91883116883116,7.496103896103896,26.37012987012988,8.159919018807972,1.625092207792208,2399,85,487,38,49,791,254,616,0.109,0.8240000000000001,0.068,-0.9865,2,0,25,1,0,0,53.0,0,0,0,4,38,14,2,3,27,0,32,40,10,1,5,101,87,59,0,5,15,0,12,0,0,1,6,0,3,0,18,48,25,1,22,27,2,17,15,7,2,5,10,13,47,7,80,75,16,124,0,0,1,1,5,40,1,12,65,307,65,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676714303880013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03725620874610035,0.20151493679251714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06962500863871786,0.0,0.16558972475201664,0.0,0.11557316677095696,0.0,0.0,0.12012211688260263,0.0,0.05028861965243784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038999086126471565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23358114519962556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6209107154348411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08137775223260492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2289162704602815,0.0,0.0,0.04959487408188553,0.041379131921435504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14192111873897556,0.043430438353530575,0.2315696099759268,0.0,0.0,0.04991416115516863,0.0,0.0,0.12010554157513965,0.0,0.04055613703300102,0.0,0.0,0.048123582154532336,0.0,0.0,0.0606917060257172,0.0,0.045412982375204185,0.044966771638654326,0.17834099554099891,0.0,0.0,0.10221647518127823,0.0,0.047253740879314235,0.044926933749733736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05107044679940445,0.0,0.04918975826471978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09075182259786999,0.0,0.04006559679935719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909665727519443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06656242023228481,0.0,0.034917691540149565,0.0,0.0,0.08497217047993043,0.08871677742098688,0.0,0.05154414633756956,0.04750689156700767,0.0,0.06135695071719568,0.06886502896924337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643730095678706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12839419016019446,0.0,0.04335947008230903,0.04605939569678612,0.0976249171930572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04528572223438604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03866329651405333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18122466619715896,0.0,0.038360064713173984,0.034853729522043415,0.044776620053426405,0.0,0.19226877303042128,0.0,0.03615545209551886,0.03785064862528744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030077682155089762,0.058018823783254965,0.04448095498897869,0.0,0.052798649561589785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050300491652813015,0.09221314410640837,0.04924453539786836,0.0442256022741279,0.0,0.0,0.03910174250188679,0.04986233166743949,0.0,0.0,0.07187194729592612,0.0,0.0,0.040706287185895744,0.041968960812676544,0.08170453073967808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0490971476181955,0.03295962579415177,0.04597740701098283,0.04613753435228913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0583092614221937
alcoholism,throwaway575388447,2020/04/08,"I love drinking, but I always hate myself afterwards I could use some help. I don't drink heavily every day, most days I don't even drink. But sometimes, when I have a drink, I just can't stop. I'll chug it so fast, and then just run to get another. Last night I did that again. I think I had 2 ciders and maybe a quarter of a handle of rum, maybe a bit more. I was by myself, not doing anything exciting. 

I just don't know how to stop after 1 or 2. It's like once I start, I'm just never satiated. And now, when I hit the morning after, I just hate myself because I know I'm just abusing it. Before I turned 21 I would only drink socially, but now that I'm of age, I can tell that I'm just slowly drinking more and more, and leading down to a path of alcoholism. 

How can I control myself better when I do have a drink?",2.088878748370273,2.8879631638418104,4.186666666666672,89.29674054758803,75.5536723163842,7.028074750108647,23.219904389395914,7.321109707123232,0.7336392003476746,628,17,145,7,13,217,95,177,0.107,0.7829999999999999,0.11,-0.3875,0,0,8,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,3,17,6,2,0,7,0,15,9,0,5,1,32,30,16,0,2,12,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,5,8,3,3,8,0,2,6,2,0,1,3,0,25,4,11,24,6,23,0,0,0,1,4,1,0,3,21,99,31,1,0.0,0.12965671988794927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169474479510676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09105457120988752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11474695303020555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005161041990613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06670754524223613,0.0,0.09311691607323863,0.0,0.0,0.0967819900484713,0.11946927686272282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12273511061840865,0.08737099373656768,0.0,0.0,0.14114666385071922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7503985474331991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07227751862586577,0.0,0.09219954019785326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057172686670545834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21607904595655292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07334865852821677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12027979170093064,0.08920009946731319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053461996872391115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987648961945439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2198743953395304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439920381499172,0.0,0.0,0.10269269270982216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11653943612887345,0.0,0.08322648719514386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155015922956753,0.0,0.0,0.10822912155261548,0.0,0.07745515547419167,0.0,0.0,0.18297685024120508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09564669054506994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07011836002902112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1190284751510656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09451243164638863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07773597067963328,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,CafeEspresso,2020/04/08,"Advice on How to Quit Alcohol in South Korea? Hey everyone, I'm an American living in SK right now and I really need some advice on how to stop drinking. As it is right now I am drinking about 675-740 ml of Soju (20%) every night. Before moving to Korea I was just drinking enough cheap whiskey to make the room spin and knock me out for sleep. Ive been drunk every single night for about two years straight and I'm sick of how it is affecting my social life, work life, and my enjoyment. I've tried to cut back on drinking on my own countless times, but I've failed every time and only make it a few days before I'm drinking like I used to. I really need help on what to do if anybody can offer some advice. 

 For the past three months it feels like alcohol has been making things harder and harder for me. I have been canceling plans to go out in the evening because I start to seriously zone out and get anxious around 5:00 pm about being away from alcohol. I've had this constant brain fog for the past few months that only leaves me for maybe two hours a day. It feels like I'm not even fully conscious because it's so heavy and doesn't let me really enter reality. It sounds stupid, but its like there's this wall between me and other people that has appeared and I'm experiencing everything second hand. I get extremely tired to the point that my last two hours of work (I'm a teacher and right now we have a few more weeks before students come back because of COVID-19) are just me staring at my computer trying not to fall asleep. I've been getting headaches and chest tightness that doesn't go away until I start drinking again. At the same time my chest is tightening my heart just beats and beats and beats, but it all dissapears when I drink. 

Today I was going to visit a hospital to see about detox or medicine according to what I needed, but the friend who was going to bring me ended up saying it wasn't a good idea to go to the hospital. He is a coworker of mine who I trust, and his concern was that if I went to the hospital for a long time I may get the coronavirus and then bring it back to school for when the students come back. That would be horrible for the school's image and we would probably lose a lot of students from their parents pulling them out. I understood his point, but the virus will be here for a long time yet, and I desperately need to get my alcohol problem solved before my students come back. I can't keep pushing back the date on solving this because it is going to affect my classes too much. Every morning I'm hungover, and by 6:00pm I am a zombie. I'll be teaching kids from 9:00-6:00 every day during the times where I'm still partially drunk or craving alcohol.

I'm sorry if this isn't all very well explained. If anybody has any suggestions they can give me on how to handle this in a foreign country, I would seriously appreciate it.",7.211343453056834,6.048117438474872,7.323554652483118,77.99424610051993,64.3899480069324,10.384963843901275,33.41474929779478,9.40505699530331,2.7944937429032453,2290,78,456,35,29,741,268,577,0.08900000000000001,0.838,0.07400000000000001,-0.6836,1,0,13,0,0,0,48.0,2,0,3,9,35,16,2,0,28,0,41,27,7,10,2,80,85,40,0,12,16,1,4,4,1,5,10,2,1,1,30,29,15,3,6,10,1,19,7,7,1,5,12,9,47,9,70,63,14,95,0,2,2,0,22,31,0,11,49,296,77,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16774204830750453,0.0,0.3057500327416341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03891107108353014,0.0,0.0,0.06464149717199479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050937288494741065,0.0,0.0,0.10751879020265054,0.26398855647589664,0.0,0.1395213627951018,0.0,0.19475756427009952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387563765309705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14786802402895874,0.0,0.06183371185546325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070510177815948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3923717609348325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05067929661043361,0.059122809715732486,0.0,0.07558558676915803,0.0,0.2410485472590417,0.05467547208206428,0.05142499742827597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05786357227494868,0.08175492708505942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04420747214299452,0.0,0.14947355523962078,0.0548899452089896,0.19511420539019905,0.04799281552622383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06780511977478647,0.038352875824944385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11269892551022692,0.0,0.0,0.06459359995960415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05085912323693161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04664134841847835,0.0,0.06058695345171161,0.0,0.0585105883456843,0.08083133626784372,0.11181779563761744,0.0,0.05052567066404896,0.10127452065670466,0.0,0.06401373581091023,0.0,0.048645783863440616,0.0,0.0,0.11458293687749402,0.0,0.057484455413030426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09134376338248372,0.06081503700088919,0.0420627529681708,0.16970947806795458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10739283227964808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703567843749299,0.0,0.0,0.06353523662846768,0.0,0.10924455044431504,0.039668642695352974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081814249824436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061692059289604674,0.054751121288314254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060859745273758335,0.0,0.0,0.10996840375858756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465948519777801,0.0,0.04550306637503696,0.0,0.11581792798965712,0.04559635625667334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057260600947116824,0.0583278479938192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06405229696301161,0.08100019876329853,0.0,0.04569538921929733,0.047837878408101525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03801394570478864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20019012642376727,0.06576514261454687,0.054237184945213096,0.0,0.0,0.07769626740194527,0.0,0.16768476057512127,0.0,0.0,0.0494190845147228,0.0,0.047211896729434925,0.0,0.0,0.04589785329283564,0.0,0.0514470025632052,0.053042843839930416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08331263153381091,0.0,0.0,0.12194079989045342,0.0,0.0,0.036847338939887515
alcoholism,lillyivy,2020/04/08,"Fucking wine. That pretty much says it all.  It’s fruit.  It’s only grapes.  But it’s so much more than that.
These grapes tell me how to feel... and how to react.  They tell me when to cry, and when I shouldn’t.  But, they are only grapes.
I come home from a long day at work, and there they are....calling to me.  They know my name, my mood.....my everything....but they are only grapes. 
I want to stand up to them.  Tell them that I am more than this!  I have a life outside of these beautiful fruits...but they win.  Every. Single. Time.

alcoholism,denice_94,2020/04/08,"Love one and alcohol Hi, my SO is an alcoholic. We been together for about 7 years and since I met him I knew what was going on with him. He has been on and off with relapses over the years and lately he relapsed again. I feel like I understand what this is but at the same time I just want to throw punches in the air. I am frustrated that I can't focus on my on things, . I am getting anxiety every time I try to communicate with him and he does answer the calls. Every time I see him passed out it breaks my heart, and I feel like I am loosing him little by little. He knows I am here to support him, but he hasn't been able to fully commit to sobriety and I am loosing it the more I think about it.",3.0888000000000027,3.4725722800000014,4.8133333333333335,87.27000000000002,72.86666666666667,8.4,25.0,8.548686976883017,1.3660000000000003,542,15,125,9,10,185,84,150,0.045,0.846,0.10800000000000001,0.8014,0,0,2,0,0,0,12.0,1,0,0,0,6,5,1,0,6,0,14,4,1,0,1,25,27,10,0,1,3,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,8,12,2,0,7,0,0,3,2,1,0,1,6,3,25,4,21,21,2,23,0,0,1,1,16,12,0,0,9,90,33,0,0.17211332529034604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36787360346154707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13166622275222706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1757469485448324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15061753081281345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29002579948793483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17405133738718684,0.24591558795458346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992210874867429,0.0,0.09781596911564147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20395511916241166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09458898242725976,0.0,0.19415132765627946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16817175391399322,0.3450055354677076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15533899582740238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11662844354460755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13715203666906095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14237392125020254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19531216190430287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143444455493262,0.11028326921457472,0.0,0.0,0.3010819922264955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11685365005675374,0.0,0.0,0.17917604152967606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10151689855873912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22167067705990776
alcoholism,kencat1,2020/04/08,"Still in love with alcohol but forced into sobriety. Can anyone relate? How do you make yourself hate it? In February I went to hospital and was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis from alcohol abuse. I was drinking about 20 units or more a day for about 4 years, and now I can’t drink without risking my life. The problem I have is that while I know it caused so many problems for me (ultimately cutting my life short and putting me in a lot of pain) I am still in love with it. I would never have stopped drinking unless I was forced to. I’ve never been interested in getting better, and I unfortunately have managed to romanticised self destruction so much that I don’t want to get better. I can recognise that it’s just addiction but I still can’t stop wanting it. I don’t want to be sober but I will be, but it’s torture seeing alcohol and just wishing that I could still drink. 

I don’t like being sober. I just straight up don’t like the mental state and I don’t think I ever will. But I’m sure there’s a way for me to see sobriety as a good thing. How? I’m sorry I’m being miserable but I miss booze so bad. I want the chaos of it all, I don’t like being in control. I want to be able to be happy sober. Any advice or just anything would be hugely appreciated.",1.867269230769232,3.9464619576923066,3.760615384615385,86.62438461538461,79.42307692307693,6.775384615384616,24.63076923076923,7.839951260653429,1.3588030769230772,999,37,208,17,25,337,131,260,0.214,0.5870000000000001,0.19899999999999998,-0.8922,0,0,7,0,1,0,24.0,0,1,0,3,18,22,4,2,7,0,33,16,0,5,5,50,54,22,0,11,14,0,0,3,0,4,9,0,0,1,12,10,8,3,2,4,0,2,11,11,0,0,5,2,29,11,30,36,4,28,0,2,2,2,4,11,0,3,16,148,41,1,0.10056087349789422,0.1191481912592814,0.0,0.10962619545512578,0.0,0.09826692173432916,0.0,0.32240697376427474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838484235785576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031450090649763,0.0,0.08275303054704616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08396412894024953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17787584123236633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330371784981766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11278757049252168,0.0802896747753187,0.0,0.0,0.06485344421264377,0.0,0.0,0.10206716981060504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39404548841422254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09096306729750417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050778118113151,0.0,0.0,0.08434568961170619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704891976035293,0.0,0.09928304339722578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05526562618040208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14205823777981275,0.1473868897954467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854932585570427,0.1815202289809634,0.0,0.06712516392782443,0.10195294207365284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10134170831600896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07392381270335435,0.0,0.15511749004556372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10700385947051187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1924463497897385,0.0,0.10109145296501612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1602679930352795,0.0,0.10490692256989136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125696648409177,0.0,0.0,0.32123217390077674,0.1681467861241667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09477743318271158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06680817597751455,0.06443534726734558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965670431572486,0.07982054065925336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09322093720882793,0.0,0.0,0.11564004169213953,0.09693709352883084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14287111860098334,0.0,0.0,0.06475790551489706
alcoholism,theotheranony,2020/04/08,"Cirrhosis - Ammonia levels - Body temperature (Background--Dad has end stage liver disease. He's had TIPS procedure, and prior to that had multiple large volume paracentesis procedures. Encephalopathy has been on and off. He does sleep 12-16 hours a day probably. Slurred speech when he wakes up, and before he dozes off.)



My dad had a fall from disorientation. He stupidly wasn't taking enough meds to lower his ammonia, bc it made him use the bathroom all the time--duh. So he reduced it, fell over in the bathroom, and we found him after I don't know how long...

He's in the hospital now. When he arrived they said his ammonia levels were at 61. 2 days later they are at 106. 
What ammonia level are they referring to? They said 61 was ""elevated,"" But now 106 is pretty high I'm guessing if 61 was just elevated...

His body temperature is at 93. They had trouble getting an accurate reading, and finally did it rectally. I'm assuming this low body temperature is a pretty bad sign? I know the liver helps regulate it...

Can anyone speak to similar circumstances? I'm at his house alone trying to clean things up.. but it's bad. You can tell he's given up, and has been very disoriented...",3.127168037602821,5.765655414414418,4.8112847630238935,77.7596650998825,78.18918918918921,8.725734430082255,27.219741480611052,9.318704503766252,2.9108705052878965,930,39,167,27,23,313,136,222,0.075,0.889,0.036000000000000004,-0.8088,1,1,0,0,0,0,49.0,1,1,5,0,7,5,1,0,9,0,22,7,7,3,1,23,36,13,0,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,9,7,0,0,5,1,0,2,2,5,0,0,16,4,16,0,20,20,2,34,0,1,0,0,28,18,0,4,13,94,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15065845663415167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10171290624492434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2429153436271395,0.0,0.0,0.12378048293095195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4847383540992125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876265124780685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12729789740070452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12883931533135362,0.15030481545145702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593504176515708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15949548527078136,0.0,0.0,0.07599975455559596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16024672128343087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09750250285156792,0.15369235747785956,0.0,0.0,0.14325428106205734,0.16784773300380865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15988814204140436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12873244869813927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13764303610431672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16157945136640414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2959815536155421,0.15683648376875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14550493141262325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2767421297842624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14557061985681866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10937200249298296,0.0,0.12714331665692485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09664085859944443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482214155022197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09876157095092276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12563554427604964,0.0,0.12002432663721466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,theflyingbaldman,2020/04/09,"Yes, I am SURE I am an alcoholic. How do you deal with the skeptics? Today is day one, again.  My last attempt at sobriety was Sept 2019, had a good month and then convinced myself I wasn't an alcoholic, I just had bad drinking habits.  My decision to break sobriety was calculated, not done in a moment of weakness, I went to a bar and had just one, went home and went to bed.  ""Ah-Ha!

How do you deal with people who express skepticism when you tell them you're an alcoholic?

alcoholism,recoverythrowaway99,2020/04/09,"Need to get some stuff off my chest I just need to put my thoughts out into the world....

I’m REALLY struggling with my addiction right now. I had a year sober and relapsed a month ago. This past month I’ve been drinking on and off. 

I got kicked out of my sober house and moved in with my mom last week. She lives in the middle of nowhere so there’s no liquor stores within walking distance, and she took my keys so I couldn’t drive anywhere. So I had alcohol delivered. It was just gonna be once, but a couple days later I did it again. 

This morning she busted me (my room smelled like alcohol). I had been lying all week pretending to be serious about getting sober. I even started outpatient today. I’m struggling so bad... I want to be sober again, I really do!! But I want to order more alcohol so badly right now. 

Of course, she now took my ID, so I’d have to be even more sneaky. I’d either have to steal my ID back or try to order it in my brother’s name and use his old one downstairs. My brain is going crazy trying to come up with ideas on how to make this work. 

So I’m writing this just to be honest for once, even if it’s to complete strangers.

alcoholism,ThePsychophile,2020/04/09,"Need an accountability buddy for the next few weeks Hey folks,

I'm in need of an accountability buddy for the next few weeks - a temporary sponsor, if you will. Here's a brief history for ya:

I am 28 year old male and recently moved out of my dad's house who is also alcoholic after living with him for the last 2 years. I moved there (and this is going to sound crazy) right after 4 months of rehab (1 IP, 3 IOP). I intended to try a method of tapering off alcohol using Naltrexone. As you probably guessed, I didn't get the results I was hoping for. I must say it, did prevent me from sinking to the depths I had gone to before treatment but I was still drinking at way unhealthy levels (think like 8-10 drinks on the worst days throughout this last year vs 12-14 on any given weekend back in 2017). 
About a month ago, I was getting frustrated with not being able to live up to my potential, not getting things done, putting off schoolwork etc. I was just stagnating and I couldn't find the will to really change anything. It was just to easy to put it off, weeks become months, you know how it is. 
Fortunately, my aunt offered to let me stay with her so I can get back on track without too much pressure. So for this last month I've been drinking between 3-6 beers a day, that is, up until Sunday. On Monday I started tapering off and it's been going just fine (still taking Naltrexone as I ought). Tonight I had 2. Tomorrow is 1 and then Friday is 0. 

The place I'm in is very supportive and I'm not really worried about going on a bender or anything. I mostly just want someone I can tell, ""Hey, I did good today."" other than my aunt or my cousin who's home from college because of Covid-19. 

Thanks",3.4566365892172333,4.824688659824052,4.68159824046921,84.85778197608843,72.95894428152494,7.709496954658245,26.898375817730656,8.263242389622931,1.7080389352582903,1327,47,270,21,26,438,196,341,0.045,0.865,0.09,0.8683,0,0,7,0,0,0,48.0,0,4,0,0,17,9,1,1,16,0,30,7,0,4,1,40,54,18,0,8,13,4,0,1,0,4,3,2,1,1,13,10,6,1,3,5,2,9,6,3,0,0,15,2,31,6,52,32,6,66,0,0,0,0,18,20,0,6,36,177,44,1,0.09516719591027284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08435997711443143,0.20340958047137775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07610517218648431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06471695664118772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566289869270964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14635539866914374,0.0,0.058013039316925225,0.1051046909760448,0.08098027432446017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10067427455321107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274993675288355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973890827608944,0.0,0.27968286438657025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10613657975208572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698109296286773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19888372792783285,0.0,0.1622571316940953,0.07982172875250923,0.0,0.0,0.104837395539702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09546045695686686,0.09452249872152824,0.0,0.10981016668814698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052301402035100295,0.2327218993899265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09731490559304593,0.0,0.04649388484101551,0.0,0.1680687550652504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038461913102804,0.20229533668039584,0.06995883907195533,0.14113053981661294,0.0,0.0,0.2024227849977469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09986196326236073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09942946442110592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260633323560296,0.0,0.0,0.19133863449142136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12193308519088746,0.0,0.09396612490533393,0.0,0.0,0.08127226532264879,0.0,0.07568077391940017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806348562655506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06735983108816031,0.1014355684420201,0.15200129117284475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799460613668296,0.0,0.0,0.0715538876208615,0.0,0.08318032388953367,0.08761716787817023,0.0,0.0,0.06322485625379187,0.06097929645635336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09020737411479628,0.0,0.0,0.0646122790842698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08219390165130225,0.0,0.07852290334100655,0.05613207784490301,0.07553929044522603,0.2290121524873653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09173778080819738,0.0,0.0,0.09664690697250294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18385366196140485
alcoholism,zjwowoskkaj,2020/04/09,"Boyfriend is an alcoholic, need advice I'm really sorry if this is not the appropriate place. My boyfriend of several years is an alcoholic and has struggled with it off and on for years. He managed about a year of sobriety but has gone back to drinking. I have had to move in with him during lockdown because I was forced out of my university home and cannot live with my parents. He was very adamant that I don't enter the kitchen earlier and as I was sleeping/newly awake it didn't really click. I've just found a 4 pack of beer that is definitely alcoholic. In this place there is no way to get space from each other and I really don't want him sneaking around with it as he gets nasty. I'm wondering if I should bring it up with him and say given the circumstances I'd rather he drink and at least be honest about it so it can be limited and cause less problems in regards to dishonesty or should I just confront him about it and say it's not on even though it's his home? 

I can't travel for at least a few weeks to my parents and am still worried about doing so as one of them is at risk so very lost and worried rn",5.542740178276659,5.033155660944209,6.1879828326180295,82.62075932651042,67.49785407725321,9.9160118851106,31.22779795311984,9.466822959209583,2.4674895344998338,891,31,193,16,13,292,129,233,0.149,0.8170000000000001,0.034,-0.973,2,1,6,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,1,2,16,6,1,2,8,0,25,7,0,1,0,37,37,22,0,8,9,2,0,0,0,2,3,2,3,0,14,19,7,1,2,4,0,5,8,5,0,1,9,3,18,1,37,24,5,27,0,1,1,0,14,15,0,4,6,137,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223508289612263,0.0,0.4014246076577648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11146077328703784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09627645258597466,0.0,0.07632502360627692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12862207638774886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2453103816880265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08269804105802234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13728301027007972,0.0,0.0,0.1308309770331884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25118565469032955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11056007277738253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13667822839263094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330752235132964,0.0,0.0928394022266554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08484350195482941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780551071663375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616293270773805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11980618712670503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2406324263086529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1991392598613356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14144826853055356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1401589829628514,0.0,0.0,0.09999047001806737,0.0,0.0,0.13089353924294178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12301523942917934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20661777151148847,0.07385033118462496,0.09938348678710232,0.10043350110327624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13578164792187072,0.0,0.2543075675057015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2418876041409312
alcoholism,emunicorn,2020/04/10,"I keep messing up Hi LONG time lurker and first post ever. I’m 33/f struggling to get better and I think my husband (rightfully so) is at his wits end. I’ve been hiding my substance abuse for years and I continue to do so. Started with my mom’s terminal diagnosis. So far I’ve only made it 11 days without alcohol before relapsing. He’s caught me drinking/ hiding my drinking multiple times now. I keep trying to do better &amp; be honest, but I feel so much shame that I also try and take care of it by myself (by hiding it) with no success. In the end I just get “caught” again and feel like a piece of crap and also chip away at any trust that was once there in our marriage.

alcoholism,Rainbowrage1411,2020/04/10,"My best and only friend is an alcoholic and vanishes half the time into binge drinking sprees. I thought I’d post here since you guys will understand what I am talking about.

I have one friend in my life who is actually my best friend. The biggest issue that I have is that when he gets drunk, which happens every other week, he’ll disappear for 1-2 weeks. There have been times where I really needed his emotional support when moving to different cities, or when I got injured, and I couldn’t reach him because he was drunk. I know he doesn’t do this intentionally and I know I can’t make him change, but I just wanted to express my feelings.

We have really good times together when he is sober even though sometimes he gets angry and lashes out quickly. I just wish he were more consistent and reliable. 

If you can relate, let me know.",6.033333333333331,6.545541469135808,6.2428148148148175,79.15866666666666,66.4074074074074,9.689876543209877,30.39753086419753,9.642632912329526,2.6643190123456786,666,23,127,13,10,213,110,162,0.068,0.787,0.14400000000000002,0.8891,1,0,2,0,0,0,16.0,1,2,0,2,13,7,0,0,3,0,19,6,0,2,0,26,35,14,0,5,5,0,1,0,3,2,3,0,0,1,7,9,4,0,6,3,0,2,3,0,0,2,5,1,23,7,7,26,3,18,0,0,0,0,20,5,0,2,10,85,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.14244683535267733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559988209462779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08898268913369928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063755390014221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1544181753241725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15250883641830218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1429962049380855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641979536797763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964126014214128,0.0,0.12298703233500324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07380742505315982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3383309628530824,0.0,0.15252785532640106,0.0,0.0,0.12243371764917645,0.11674650397874535,0.0,0.0,0.14453443832180765,0.12908185076363066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15235600909532354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24066586339951584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492654426387715,0.10310377598512907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974369099989352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15514428539668834,0.0,0.10823579577659714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989138634061309,0.11101767589982207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13980006017090926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18702577803897535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12074888570172387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443692500354838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1656463887968226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11732612188812645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14341596362027256,0.115884828270042,0.2553509431148909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15196116795247291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08609759619755679,0.0,0.23417858482121484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16785967698709056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,latkinsdawg,2020/04/10,"Detoxing without health insurance I’m sure many of you will respect my inability, currently, to accept the title of “alcoholic” at this current time. Not that I don’t think that I am because I’m not that naive to the fact. It’s not that I’m uncomfortable with know that I am it’s others knowing I am. Regardless it’s a “journey” we all have to take and in due time I’m positive I’ll confront in due time. 

My question is, that I know will be difficult to answer, does anyone have any advice for going through withdrawal without insurance. I know the instant response is to go to hospital and go that way but it’s not always an option. I don’t think I would go through seizures, I know everyone says that even those who do have seizures, but I don’t think I would. BUT I’m not naive to the possibility of this happening. I’ve been a heavy drinker for a year and a half now. 6-8 drinks for five days a week and I know the risks. If one were to, and I know it’s not advised, detox without medical care because of lack of insurance what would be recommended to the best of ones knowledge. Hospital is just not possible so please don’t say go because it’s not possible. Access to Benzos are. I know the dosage recommended for my weight. I know this is a hard question and I hope I didn’t violate any rules for this subreddit but this is the reality for many of us who have this problem. All responses encouraged.

alcoholism,NegaiTx,2020/04/10,"Need advice for helping my stepdad. He was almost 3 years sober and today had a relapse. Need advice for helping my step dad, which is my father figure in my life and I love him dearly. He was almost 3 years sober and today had a relapse.

Today he had his first relapse since he stopped drinking, he was sober for 2.5 years. His brother died today, it wasn’t unexpected because he was battling with cancer, which got worse this month. My stepdad left the house this afternoon and return minutes ago, drunk.

I'm not staying with my parents during the quarantine, but I'm few blocks away their house. My mom wrote to told me, and she said my step dad didn't want me to know. I can't go to their house right now because in my country we are on a night-time curfew. The thing is, this situation puts me (and also my mom) under extreme anxiety, because I can’t avoid remembering those hard times when he was a regular drinker.

Her mother died last year and this didn’t happen. I think is important to talk with him tomorrow, but I don't have the emotional tools to do it. What to say or to do avoiding being cruel (which was my kind of shield when he was drinking too much). I want to offer my support instead to turn my back.

alcoholism,deathviarobot1,2020/04/11,"I relapsed yesterday.... My first “real” sober date (first time I stopped with the right attitude) was Nov 22, and yesterday, for the 3rd time since, I slipped up and had a couple of beers. Just like the last few times, it ended with few beers, a lot of disappointment with myself, a huge amount of reflection on the cause of the trigger, and started again the next day with a new attitude. 

The problem is my girlfriend, who has been incredibly supportive, has taken this particular mistake particularly hard. I really can’t blame her; I’ve not kept my word about it many times over the past couple of years but have been on a good program since November. The past few times I’ve slipped, I’ve been able to stay positive and focused, forgive myself, and move on with a new understanding of my sobriety the next day. 

This time though, it feels like while Im able to forgive myself, it seems like she’s struggling to forgive me. The past relapses, she’s had the same attitude as me; “ok it happened. Learn from it and move forward.”  This was incredibly helpful. Her reaction this time is killing me and putting me in a very dark anxious place that I used to block out by drinking. Not her fault, but I’m struggling to move forward with a positive attitude this time around. 



Just needed to vent. God, grant me the serenity....",6.052620967741934,6.924069826612903,6.013870967741938,79.55330645161294,66.45967741935483,9.748387096774195,33.645161290322584,9.827888789773867,3.1758338709677414,1039,45,198,22,16,327,131,248,0.109,0.706,0.18600000000000005,0.9711,0,0,3,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,2,6,16,1,2,21,1,13,3,0,3,0,42,24,12,1,3,6,0,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,13,15,3,3,8,3,0,6,3,7,0,2,9,2,22,9,31,15,6,47,0,1,0,0,11,13,0,2,34,123,35,2,0.2013949916346755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11375950787096015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08964212038630362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1034440666062361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22283972764980672,0.0,0.12988310861240476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09864520996395007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918809269391548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05091567950645877,0.07193831113221713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1713064770017758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08446028193125338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08904646299268486,0.0,0.0902051772484466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06749540883424869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10877057525976344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11140685954665526,0.0,0.0,0.08208189900686277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14758713008810728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08560940996737322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10209145566184764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3210765057916693,0.0,0.07466591721521944,0.0,0.19450853789239608,0.21418585837984308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2883814617504021,0.0,0.0,0.10520745075965476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09635390400332944,0.0,0.10122879613139472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461579572754353,0.06450939432733191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08599511122623693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0916712182586541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16659601823862266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07127420582667826,0.10733013231313474,0.0,0.08418761543868064,0.0,0.2105417727972947,0.0,0.0,0.11427032493420128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09893477837142256,0.0,0.4697401567912001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10482964443377532,0.0,0.0869703051411358,0.0,0.0830859799441952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06484588580928001

alcoholism,JadedRavenclaw,2020/04/11,"Will going cold turkey kill me? Trigger warning for suicide and depression. I don’t know if I’m an addict yet but I’m definitely dependent on Alcohol a lot of the time. Last year around this time I went through a mental breakdown and attempted suicide. I’ve been kinda forced to go back to “Normal” life even though I still feel suicidal and extremely depressed. When the suicidal urges get too extreme, I drink, and then I don’t feel it as strongly anymore. I’ve been drinking for about a year now, heavily, and I’ve decided it’s time to quit. I’ve “quit” for several weeks at a time before now so I’m confident that though it’ll be hard I can do it. However I’ve been drinking more than usual during this quarantine because with so much alone time the brain goes to some dark places. If I quit cold turkey will I die? I know alcohol withdrawal can kill you, and though I’ve been drinking regularly  less than a year it has been a lot of drinking. Yes I do have a therapist, for those of you about to suggest that. I think cold turkey will be the best for my personality but I don’t wanna experience horrible withdrawal.",3.0841855203619915,5.227257723981907,4.577418552036203,81.92603733031676,75.83257918552036,8.401900452488688,28.244570135746606,9.120678840339163,2.583962714932127,891,38,172,22,20,297,118,221,0.235,0.674,0.091,-0.9911,1,2,7,0,0,3,19.0,0,2,0,6,16,6,2,0,12,1,20,10,1,2,0,26,32,18,7,4,4,0,3,0,0,4,4,0,0,1,10,8,7,0,6,5,0,3,3,4,0,0,6,6,16,2,24,20,7,25,0,2,0,0,4,4,0,7,18,112,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094753660656366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1979222189317148,0.0,0.09590554821069663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09183419785755673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08243352482126519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120359127162322,0.0,0.056448026892196065,0.0,0.07879567691380905,0.0,0.09717786028402736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1033720898295233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15951228057045502,0.0,0.09610405499603428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4535631424725104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06116134689529625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09058045040198448,0.0,0.0,0.09364256249852236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04837961497397004,0.0,0.10525329065284507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08295130331223824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204896093089328,0.0,0.10178094384775896,0.07548126070646388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06540603319765696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15745021182157526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09331889853086824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06807156590619144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09072822082073996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08085464279204566,0.09674716490645527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2954741096883197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10461150601217263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07395038316213516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4051569531973923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10751559691079997,0.0,0.05933426358565538,0.2729367335384821,0.0,0.2699786712117195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10198568454967896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07427803757258061,0.0,0.0,0.08584101575647927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17889385863633395

alcoholism,dylandonaghue,2020/04/11,"Alcohol Humour I used to use humour to make my drinking seem funny, i.e. okay.

""You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.""

Found that one in my Facebook Memories section today from 8 years ago.

Nowadays I look back at those old Facebook statuses and smh. I think of how dysfunctional I was. I had a partner at the time, but used to make excuses not to spend time with him, because he wasn't a heavy drinker, and I wanted to spend my evenings drinking. When I got together with my work friends, it always involved alcohol and my hot tub. 

I used to black out almost every time I drank. I often fell and injured myself. I would do things, irrational things, that I couldn't recall the following day. But the evidence was around me: a hole in the wall, a broken curtain rod.

Yet, if I couldn't spend the evenings after work with a buzz, I wasn't able to function. 

Illogical, considering I wasn't functioning while I was drinking?

Yes.

But that is the nature of the beast.",3.6062499999999993,5.4979871250000025,4.4545833333333364,84.49875,73.58333333333334,7.508333333333333,28.66666666666667,8.278499904357787,2.0485354166666667,776,32,150,13,16,250,115,192,0.068,0.84,0.092,0.3111,0,0,6,0,0,0,31.0,0,1,0,2,8,4,0,0,13,2,13,8,0,7,0,34,27,12,0,6,8,0,1,0,2,1,3,0,1,1,7,9,7,1,3,4,3,2,8,0,0,1,10,3,25,4,23,14,1,26,0,0,2,0,7,11,0,5,13,102,32,2,0.1400091644262691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12410967659430396,0.29925443453169304,0.14019895389100892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11649884070297024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12463784000599205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10765840519384476,0.0,0.08534828711617244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902943283857618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4114670372764688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18494946529134515,0.0,0.11796375957487835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15351282217932555,0.10817073312798668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11197811887226664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11757243590894866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18691440888702773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14691606598887574,0.0,0.09487383328089534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12745908491720853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1860317352086411,0.0897122192420738,0.0,0.0,0.24492140910249754,0.0,0.13271231703420566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4836918596186796,0.0,0.0,0.08258103269098026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13496383826823966,0.0,0.2038566784068485,0.0,0.0,0.09945849334924954,0.0,0.0,0.09016131150974817

alcoholism,NESJunkie22,2020/04/11,Isolation has made me relapse. Anyone else? All AA meetings are video only (which I don’t do well) and I have been isolated for too long now. Had stated to sort myself out doing a tafe course 3 days a week and was going so well. Several Months sober. Unfortunately tafe shut down and I have been sitting at home doing nothing. Went fine for 3 weeks in isolation but then relapsed. Anyone else finding this isolation hard? I feel so disgusted with myself as I was doing so well. Has anyone else relapsed during these difficult times? If so have you then stopped drinking? If so any tips on how to stop this crazy urge that controls me during these crazy times?,3.2047952853598005,5.896997879032263,3.736451612903228,85.26313895781641,78.2741935483871,6.396029776674937,24.054590570719604,7.61054688173877,1.3720888337468984,523,18,94,8,13,164,83,124,0.252,0.7090000000000001,0.039,-0.9791,0,3,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,0,1,11,6,1,0,2,0,16,1,0,3,1,17,20,15,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,5,1,3,2,2,0,2,1,2,4,0,7,2,10,4,11,13,1,22,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,3,12,65,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09982839693024112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3079359547125995,0.4512389644766665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16464763195628793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09467325138038167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14380719494876076,0.0,0.0,0.3678953413772249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0742260171721443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341716842753563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08342929060218801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13150312635246614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14725142965340482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299125514347085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13890482305251098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11717361170132727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14085766033284122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11164730258258698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658411567237052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24546118012392246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17119942855720127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2355067074317855,0.0,0.3959699630261248,0.1360842023030987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,AlphaRogueFTW,2020/04/11,I don’t want to be like this. I can’t even remember what I was like before I started. I’m losing everything I’ve already lost my fiancé because of it. And now I can’t even take care of my sisters. It’s ruining me as a person and I don’t know if I can take it anymore. I fear that I will never get better. Every time I try to stop it never works. I also fear of hurting the only ones I have left.

alcoholism,Im_a_DTodd,2020/04/11,"I'm the worst I've ever been. I've been an addict my whole life.
Starting with Ritalin when I was 6. (Early90's I'm 36)

 Between the age of 12 and now I have done everything under the sun.
I'm a felon for DUIs, been to prison,  been to rehab
 barely have held a drivers license.
I've been in and out of jail for various things.

I was in prison when my daughter was born back in 2015.
I vowed to myself that I would make myself a better person. Since then I've made my way into a really good middle management position.( I have a great work ethic)
Although my partying and drug use slowed down, my alcoholism took the fast track.
I've been with my wife for 15 yrs. and she's stuck through with me all this time
I'm at my worst at this moment.
She's distant and expressed how she hates me,hates herself for being with me, and finds me just plain disgusting.
I've been in and out of rehab programs inpatient and outpatient and several AA meetings.
And I'm still drinking more than ever.",1.926190102120973,3.95644376616916,3.4472322597538643,89.18990573448549,79.0,6.61963864886096,23.01675831369469,7.669130373188453,1.0592228855721395,771,25,160,12,19,254,114,201,0.11599999999999999,0.82,0.064,-0.8836,2,0,3,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,2,9,7,2,0,10,0,16,8,0,4,3,28,29,15,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,1,7,0,0,1,4,17,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,4,1,0,15,0,22,3,28,12,6,29,0,0,0,0,9,12,0,0,15,107,26,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21117097883816907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070155949843904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14894996521038364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17131952517716084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1982311636060574,0.0,0.1897606934860228,0.2246404907539632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3504410579896314,0.0,0.0,0.1740928094794551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1770461614479792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624735927589064,0.0,0.21356442786661206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19124715009202936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368221208418567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18329177173916444,0.1293020022492121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16913888774277056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12409469662431062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21883559386321014,0.0,0.16023776503960133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13710795212741425,0.0,0.15469594724900268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869139403218025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129530490425065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2152173946757778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1673020456067169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15375687929721255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2162687468407412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410221761223921,0.0,0.0,0.13760503973260496,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,endlessly15,2020/04/11,"been drinking hardcore since my dui in 2016 Parents were and are alcoholics, but I knew that I wasn’t okay. Went to catholic school where friends parents drank also, but I knew not to do shit. Drank like twice after being 18 and then was straight edge because of the hardcore punk scene I was in. 22 (2013) was dating a dude and started smoking weed and drank occasionally. Not the most social and went out with friends in late 2016. Drank more than I should irished goodbyed and yeah. Hit a metal pole and came as close to death as I have. So glad I didn’t hurt anyone else, but broke a lot in me. In the icu for almost a week. 

Probation I was pissing every week so I know I couldn’t smoke. But could get away with drinking. I fucking hate what I do. I don’t want that buzz, but it’s entertainment. I have all the entertainment in the world, but I want the normal entertainment and enrichment from it. 

I have a problem with procrastination. And with my temp shit I can’t handle stupidity and honestly human interaction.  I want to hopefully be permanent at my job. 

BUT I DONT WANT TO DRINK. I AM BETTER THAN THAT.

alcoholism,jnksjdnzmd,2020/04/11,"How do people not want to drink? New to the area, but how do you people just want to be sober? Like, I can see the value in sobriety, but I can't see the reason for sobriety, if that makes sense. 

I'm a basically a nihilist and a sociopath. Well a more controlled sociopath because I don't have anger issues. However, caring for people and things in general is just absolutely foreign. Other than entertainment, life has no point. With that in mind, drugs and alcohol are a go-to with alcohol being the default due to accessibility. 

I'll get sober and healthy every once in awhile and just get bored and go back to being drunk. Suicide is a constant option because, well, why not? Im getting older, alcohol is giving me worse hangovers, and I've done all I want to do. I'm just baffled how people don't want to drink and actually continue living life half the time.",4.690357142857142,5.955213988095237,6.024761904761906,76.80357142857143,69.83333333333333,8.695238095238095,30.07142857142857,9.075114841892004,2.5950857142857147,682,27,126,13,12,230,96,168,0.129,0.705,0.166,0.8682,1,0,6,0,0,2,24.0,0,1,0,1,10,7,1,0,11,0,17,9,0,6,1,33,32,14,1,5,9,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,0,0,4,10,6,1,1,4,0,1,6,2,2,1,1,2,6,5,16,28,2,14,0,0,2,0,2,6,0,2,8,81,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.12393646608729525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4071822838464279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097657356068244,0.0,0.15483952320696856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12948787495798475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13724496765241082,0.14244450114225107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299680151032995,0.0,0.2488288947949289,0.14728299104950393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10700538291655157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19906124964684668,0.12183271113110082,0.14435729854451407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371848771875826,0.13255798423101514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17941174479890426,0.06204717978568501,0.0,0.11214584775555697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08477539189856699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12823667909476474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12266014875337085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13525389563861906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3521911539947595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005874891525985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13058008722444125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024096646225201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13892050996060884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843750535434378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405638607405937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2996382976123612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22838163812987197,0.0,0.1146003225972521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294267593913597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,redhand22,2020/04/11,"Not an every day drinker, but probably nearly half the days drinker Like the title says, I don't drink every single night or the occasional day, but whenever my schedule is open on the next day, I  will hit 8-12 drinks usually beer 3-4 nights a week since I work from home most of the time. There was a good stretch of a few months about 9-14 months ago when I didn't drink much, but since then it's been trying to not drink so much but ending up drinking around 20 drinks a week a more. It's cut down some since I don't meet my friends with whom I used to drink a lot due to the quarantine, but I still enjoy how drinking feels when I'm at home playing games or about to eat dinner. I feel like I always do the same shit, drink till I get drunk enough to not care about what I will eat then order an unhealthy pile of food to devour causing me to have to drink so much water I am waking up every 2 hours to drink and pee until it's early morning and I won't be able to sleep again for at least several hours. I drink coffee thinking it helps prevent liver damage and sometimes wallow in despair that I have ruined my body and mind from drinking so much. The depressing thoughts that I have drank away my potential and my health hit especially hard after that 2 or 3rd day of drinking straight with a foggy mind. I obtain supplements like DHM and sylmarin to prevent the damage I have certainly done to my liver, knowing there is no repairing the body from drinking this much. I feel my healthfulness starting to return after that day of abstinence and then letting myself believe my throat and stomach are fine after 2 days of rest. Forgetting that hope to abstain for at least 2 weeks, because I heard 2 weeks is enough time for the liver to fix itself usually. I'm 35 now and I've wanted to control my drinking since I was 27. From 22-27, I drank whenever I could as much as I wanted. From 20-22, I drank nearly every single night about .375 of hard liquor. I still am on the fence about whether or not I will be having those 8-12 beers tonight. I don't want to be a ""drinker"" any more, but I wish I could want it more than drinking.",7.6786551724137935,5.601318951724142,7.4322701149425265,80.51599137931036,64.08045977011494,10.263218390804598,33.70402298850575,8.395991825355821,2.4146574712643685,1684,52,353,17,20,536,208,435,0.11800000000000001,0.7879999999999999,0.094,-0.9045,0,1,22,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,3,18,18,2,0,22,0,30,42,11,4,1,58,54,33,0,8,15,0,5,3,1,4,2,2,2,0,15,13,29,5,6,23,0,0,10,7,0,1,10,7,41,11,60,32,21,62,0,5,0,0,7,16,1,8,48,230,56,1,0.04736436192642325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04198564904570653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03941094340270858,0.0,0.0,0.032209390303145145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04216432394238205,0.0,0.0,0.04450037716932675,0.0,0.0,0.028872875410234318,0.0,0.0,0.05336341639042884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10522225713837832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04829112365323576,0.048656246812398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05312315937392527,0.07563317785008389,0.0,0.0,0.2138226656065152,0.0,0.04079485552354895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04847018680595026,0.0,0.7887837290787276,0.0,0.0969311335532976,0.0,0.0,0.04195076617937768,0.0978800943240365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15962607092476316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07184653358952145,0.033837109624083775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05727317444900217,0.0,0.03659358853197485,0.0,0.024745924214609867,0.0,0.0,0.039726979596952934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08485832995455601,0.0,0.0,0.10069220374074443,0.0,0.0,0.031747333401381694,0.0,0.09502063373244192,0.04704349851662565,0.0932887113467414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02603021462968686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04843326910346836,0.0,0.06941950431275418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04026748674423405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09564900696771736,0.0,0.07561156361459985,0.0,0.20890953497551631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05037253624572177,0.13334473535423327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051066793098499694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037666041670177515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053508247247239266,0.048618836873303435,0.15672115854139318,0.0,0.04739856790215615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04684456504883108,0.0,0.03352473915455533,0.0,0.07565048123496426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030349170633340125,0.0,0.037602012719012805,0.05523708066681253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03215729266966954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04090760128760797,0.10433030615060997,0.0,0.11174691133002736,0.0,0.151971336652429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05446667871284815,0.0,0.0,0.034481819589264086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,ogbryan98,2020/04/12,"Anybody notice a nootropic like factor after drinking consecutively and not drinking for a day? Of course I’m not dependent however I seem to know when to stop and not go into “dependent” territory but I’ve noticed that at a night that I didn’t drink after three+ consecutive days I was very clear minded and was still social, of course their could be other factors like nutrition and my overall attitude in general but I was somewhat surprised how good I felt being sober instead of having a drink, also if you’re ever are mindful you’ll notice that a few drinks is actually uncomfortable until you keep drinking in that that uncomfortableness is no longer a concern, for me it’s don’t drink or drink at least 2 drinks bare minimum, there are moments were I can take a drink but in the comfort of my home being alone it just feels uncomfortable having a drink and feeling the burn all the way to the bladder(I believe that’s the place).

So do you guys every get a clear mind after consecutive drinking days?",5.608714285714285,7.30243993157895,6.2849624060150395,74.17473684210529,68.10526315789474,8.586466165413531,31.46616541353384,9.04235418022936,2.867669172932331,817,34,138,15,14,267,116,190,0.07200000000000001,0.805,0.12300000000000001,0.8659,1,1,12,0,0,0,10.0,0,3,1,0,9,5,0,0,14,0,19,12,0,3,4,35,29,15,0,2,9,0,3,2,0,1,0,0,1,1,9,6,12,2,5,12,0,1,6,0,0,1,6,3,13,5,19,18,4,22,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,6,15,101,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.07209701038346203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07651823496381331,0.0,0.05908245481792178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08323836988445754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05898781280569779,0.0,0.0,0.14294102589376234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8685007719567882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06682941985993326,0.06224776651116561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07471271197088399,0.0,0.07093716096070378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03859967243922363,0.0,0.04198816531028739,0.061967715820319375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07315361464265313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07410847348498449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06566865604904333,0.0,0.0,0.04060295948192535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07218886105921715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2237956626354952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06933213272524244,0.0,0.0,0.2523413659955707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07718971878593849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06725831209725927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07531217890137744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059001308058141785,0.06176766297489762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055549172427429135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06095940335630653,0.0,0.058643145879387924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,pussytiger_in_space,2020/04/12,"Is this how alcoholism starts? I’ve never considered myself an alcoholic but lately have been starting to wonder if I’m veering into dangerous territory. Even though I never have more than a few beers, I have noticed that lately I’ve been wanting one more and more. I live by myself, and while in some ways social distancing has been easier for me than it is for a lot of people, I think the stress of the pandemic has been getting to me. Before this, I occasionally drank socially and every once in a while would have a beer on my own. Now I’ve discovered that there are ways to get beer delivered along with food - like I can order a six pack from a restaurant and have it delivered with my meal, even though I wouldn’t drink all of it at once. Also a local liquor store is doing delivery. I started by getting some wine with my first meal, then it was a six pack which lasted me less than a week. I recently ordered another five tall boys from the liquor store. I keep checking for updates on which new restaurants are delivering beer, and think about having one more and more - I drank one of the tall boys at 10:30 this morning to stave off anxiety about the lack of work coming my way (I’m a freelancer). I keep thinking about going in for that last one in the fridge and stopping myself. Am I just self medicating to cope with a stressful time, or is this how alcoholism starts?",8.123849013440093,6.7477532750929425,7.92089219330855,75.12896196740064,62.71747211895912,11.250900772090363,34.07520732056048,10.214889679676881,3.1942334000571915,1097,36,211,20,13,352,142,269,0.076,0.897,0.027000000000000003,-0.912,0,0,9,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,2,13,4,1,2,18,0,24,17,0,2,3,37,44,18,0,5,4,0,0,1,0,2,4,0,0,3,13,14,16,3,4,8,3,2,3,3,0,8,7,0,23,1,39,35,13,41,0,0,0,0,5,13,0,6,22,163,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3378809087437943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08427818289542367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105077692151366,0.08062099332628614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08967682713751851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078182426243718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032394291578928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13921463074749155,0.0,0.08879334257567628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08964238052296827,0.12743473719010892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651815380841057,0.0,0.059894029223550076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873461426764941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1718094249231398,0.2377629214855219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05148690972734902,0.0,0.09305891354983917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08959651075612872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616661386713867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16256235988546447,0.10178370762090687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11998413551025285,0.0,0.2244680624992562,0.2856526380758775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0730622818600798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040572412258777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10994193431233236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21485815399050875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298374683410072,0.0,0.0,0.08810849876268598,0.241441584033192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025837726372884,0.2070849673625512,0.0,0.061452180061993565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06216015793671685,0.2509545916406413,0.08453533234820226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428802747858695,0.07672320697200632,0.0,0.0,0.07486411168859733,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,savannaannavas,2020/04/12,"Librium, seroquel, and gabapentin to withdraw I recently had a bender for about a week. Started slow and progressed to killing half a handle and 6-12 beers a day. Decided I was done after my taper with beer didn’t work. I called my psychiatrist who prescribes me klonopin (I have anxiety and use 1mg as needed). 
Well, he put me on Librium to ward off seizures. Gabapentin for anxiety. Seroquel for sleep. 

The Librium didn’t help my withdraw the first night. I still felt like I would seize any moment. No outward shakes but inward, if that makes sense. Anxiety was awful and I couldn’t sleep. Decided to take another because my first dose was only one and it says one-two per dose. Finally I fell asleep around 3am after taking them at 9:30 and 10:30. I woke up, took another Librium and started the gabapentin at a small dose. That night I took half a seroquel and it knocked me out. I woke up talking to my husband about how I needed to put a package into the mailbox, and some other weird shit. I was slurring my words and it made my husband worried. I woke up groggy. Had thoughts like “I just want to die” and I was easy to snap on my husband. I then slept all day long. 
I’ve withdrawn from alcohol before with klonopin. I would have this time without telling my doc but I was 5 days shy of my next script. 

Just to be clear- this virus has had me in a panic. We have a 6 week old newborn. I worry about her and I can’t stand that we can’t leave the house. I stopped taking my klonopin when I was drinking but I did take it in the mornings in a higher dose when I started to get “the fear”. 

I fucked up. I binged again. I don’t want it to happen again and I honestly believe it won’t after this hellacious experience. All of these medications combined as left me as a shell of a person. I have no joy, no sadness. I’m just sitting here staring out the window. 

My psychiatrist didn’t call me back today due to it being a holiday. I can’t see him on FaceTime until tomorrow afternoon. 

What do I do? Do I stop the meds all together and drink small amounts? I can’t take the gaba or seroquel anymore, I refuse. But I don’t know much about Librium. Can I take it as directed and drink a beer or two? My doctor said to avoid alcohol or it will be a “Whitney Houston”. I’ve mixed Benzos and alcohol before, which I’m not
proud of. But will this help me until he HOPEFULLY prescribes me klonopin again? 

I fucked up. I need someone to explain all of these medications and tell me everything’s going to be okay. 

Btw my husband has been very good about taking care of my daughter during this. He doesn’t drink and is the best husband and father there is. He supports me and takes care of me but there is only so much he can do. I feel awful so please don’t make me feel worse. 

Also- I know you guys aren’t doctors. I just need advice about these meds and alcohol.

EDIT- I don’t abuse my klonopin when I take it for anxiety. It actually helped me stop drinking in the past, and I hate to blame this on the virus but COVID has me really on edge and I started drinking again.",1.3755739808039529,3.736881798061393,2.867416848807373,90.71797027938801,83.20032310177707,5.902888910006652,24.450275586809845,7.227595868285454,1.1061555449966742,2399,95,497,35,68,782,272,619,0.165,0.732,0.10300000000000001,-0.9908,1,1,13,0,1,1,71.0,2,1,1,6,28,24,5,4,28,3,52,28,5,5,5,85,102,49,2,11,17,7,3,2,0,5,12,2,2,3,27,32,13,5,9,10,0,7,20,11,1,6,26,7,82,13,67,66,9,78,0,1,2,2,34,25,3,6,46,331,109,4,0.0,0.07236124015847556,0.05959820905616346,0.0,0.0,0.059679599397175084,0.0,0.2610728506604633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04883986832549088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04153157466140571,0.128080238846822,0.18688199308767497,0.0,0.06056777241129534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05436770927296136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04696118669970718,0.0,0.03722939085476944,0.0,0.10393685005474973,0.06880809264465851,0.06409209926599581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12472424338071098,0.0,0.1245355089687429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181606435358249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06338388820939042,0.0,0.0,0.12502112626736125,0.0,0.06249864288760034,0.0,0.3589683559499801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05488826343459463,0.05974088338387524,0.0,0.06872384017389045,0.0617604503087005,0.0,0.058639432152605836,0.06690222914565615,0.0,0.10389692588787536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129215747667464,0.03190799917079467,0.0,0.03470905992825017,0.051224937935005946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06047163946879745,0.054006444636839436,0.0,0.0,0.06029671177548294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228073616157156,0.0,0.0,0.0606590361564896,0.0,0.07046977134100423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06756796609389026,0.0,0.06712798920876759,0.0,0.0,0.06466724021513592,0.0663557381678627,0.0,0.0,0.05967413641773489,0.0,0.0,0.05404747542059197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057788527180958074,0.08153309011780692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356761487024319,0.12304877166771098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08979101919922594,0.1811387264050611,0.0,0.0,0.06495157872545251,0.11462530605614425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408559361126925,0.0,0.08276897265195139,0.09289718007178792,0.0,0.07165573118791407,0.0,0.0,0.05830086498248808,0.0,0.05332638295181919,0.0,0.06703955646481884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227899950248038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03912477729274096,0.0,0.06030198783583016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058094185299115614,0.04856751422804312,0.0,0.0,0.048667086806654936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06269031591563956,0.0,0.0,0.12223374259151283,0.0,0.05174675582895229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17291047040596838,0.0,0.04877278923957768,0.15317869928208636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693046502891369,0.0,0.0,0.4132720699869105,0.049087975332869,0.10676057748301053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04848495373432496,0.03561202056606151,0.0,0.05788984042975946,0.0,0.13570817875812696,0.0,0.0,0.11931843490773378,0.0,0.0,0.05274726038292656,0.0,0.050391427409332924,0.0720445986000445,0.0,0.0979777769024965,0.0,0.05491175052654041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058871966338456025,0.0,0.044461700493374584,0.1240447153588146,0.06223836540760256,0.08676868037634156,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,nolinesruss,2020/04/12,"Broken priorities This is extremely difficult to post, as Ive never been able to admit that I drink too much, but I need help.  I have two young children, and my wife is not necessarily an active participant in their upbringing.  For example, my 6 year old asked her if she wanted to go lay in the bed upstairs because she's always laying down looking at her phone.  Additionally, when I have been able to not drink for an 'extended period' of time, there is minimal recognition from her part (not that she owes me that), so I fall right back into drinking to control my stress and anxiety, but, I need to take responsibility for my situation and not throw blame on her.  Through the years, I began to lean on liquor to calm my nerves, but I don't want to do that anymore.  I completely understand that wanting to be the best dad cannot live in tandem with excessive drinking, but I still cannot stop.  It breaks my heart when my kids ask for their mama, but she is emotionally unavailable, and I dont want them to look at me with that same level of disappointment.

I am just interested in seeing who else was in this position, and how you climbed out of it.  My kids should be enough motivation to quit drinking, altogether, but, for some reason, its not.  Im sure my perception of the issues is clouded, so I am more than open to a good ass-kicking.  Any help is deeply appreciated, and I hope everybody is enjoying their Sunday.",10.31942057942058,7.151038091575093,10.341105561105561,65.12586413586415,60.02564102564102,14.176356976356974,40.2027972027972,12.40481918309499,4.738226373626373,1121,42,216,29,11,376,165,273,0.084,0.759,0.156,0.9805,1,0,5,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,4,5,10,10,0,1,7,0,23,7,1,4,2,45,41,19,0,9,13,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,12,12,6,2,5,6,1,4,10,3,0,1,4,3,39,7,40,34,7,35,0,1,3,0,25,15,0,3,14,157,51,1,0.2247974335798036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935247364426684,0.0,0.0,0.07643498173336437,0.0,0.0859847106954582,0.0,0.11146932461942044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2101552549741944,0.0,0.0,0.08642767525269991,0.0,0.06851721450795265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179555188212446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784791607913585,0.0,0.12606471833675445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13173045897580274,0.5505397590785668,0.0,0.0,0.09389470518963992,0.12643342793495538,0.0,0.1161379205148626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387878098114608,0.0942747109223713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13319302057475507,0.15067698120201228,0.0,0.0,0.11163728701318262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12140990184973274,0.11731505822525695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925012616543476,0.0,0.18877322752665968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262598960268641,0.1666844486014862,0.08668881954946832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794354577172166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171685710847192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764690080969076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11954987073758287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155646008398655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09598789000242144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0895672249706321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12634086699347488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08976176041975703,0.09397036011773588,0.12875235032720914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10593446039030792,0.0,0.0845098468331094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06554059564672854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10979721413141301,0.11701102813193605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26518270125207843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14476217695202406

alcoholism,Networkishard00,2020/04/12,"My mom is not likely to make it through the next few days. I apologize in advance if this is the wrong sub. Its just been a very rough weekend... 

My mom has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. Over the years she's driven away friends and even family. As her son, I always tried to keep communication channels as open as possible but over the years with the issues going on we've been speaking less and less (due to my own fault)

Friday night I received a call that my mom was in the hospital for a myriad of issues. I went to go see her, but could only temporarily be with her due to the current situation with coronavirus. The nurse and doctor told me that given her previous history with her drinking, that this will likely be the last time I see her alive (Due to COVID19 cant come visit daily, stay by her bedside etc otherwise I would be there right now). I held her hand and told her how much I loved her and im waiting for her to get better. Then we'll go home together and i'll take care of her. She's unresponsive and I ended up just crying for the hour talking to her. The doctors told me that she was found passed out laying on the ground somewhere after several hours. 

In the past i've dumped out her alchohol and she's kicked me out of the house. Other times I voice my opinion on how I want her to stop drinking and get better and shed reply ""fuck you, your not my son"". This battle constantly occurred. The last time I was with my mom was her birthday, she was slightly intoxicated and I took her to red lobster. For 30 minutes she spoke how she needs the money if I were to die. To not include my sisters or dad in the will, only include her. After that I didnt text her that much... This past decade her drinking has become worse and worse. I've had to drive to bars to find her laying her on the ground and carry her home on several occasions. I tried hard for my mom to get her better and hope for her to lessen her drinking. She's been in and out of rehabs with no success.

If I only had been more assertive in this situation I could have helped her more. I tried but I didnt try hard enough, I'm the only one in the family who cares about her and I let her down. I should have had her live with me. Over the past few years after she divorced my dad she had basically been living boyfriend to boyfriend.

The worst part is that my mom tried to call me 4 days before she was in the hospital. I had saw the call and figured i'd give her a call back later but I just got caught up with work and other aspects of life. I dont think I'll ever forgive my self for not returning that phone call. All I had to was give her a call and offer to bring her to my place for a bit to catch up. We wouldnt be where were at right now if I had just made that call and said that...

It's also affecting me how little any of the family cares. Her exhusband didnt care at all and said it was only a matter of time. My older sister said that she also mentally prepared for this many years and only feels anger and spite against our mom... Then I was told 5 days ago that my younger sister had answered my moms phone call but replied back with stating that she never wanted to talk to her again and hung up.... My mom tried to call me one day after that but I didnt pick up. She has depressive tendencies and I could only imagine what she was feeling. I failed my mother in not returning that phone call, I failed her by not being a better son and being more assertive. I should have been a better communicator and spent time with her even if the times I visited over the years were rough. I feel such guilt that I havent talked to her in months. I was a bad son. I hope she miracously recovers and I can just take her back to my house and take care of her. I wish she didnt drink so much over the years.. shes not even 50... I love you mom and i'll always will, im so sorry.",3.3216611230678907,4.171579975216858,4.378171264592712,88.89001565251421,72.66790582403966,7.4971108067566705,23.823322246135785,7.731754440074428,0.9019026022304828,3028,78,674,37,57,988,304,807,0.09699999999999999,0.8059999999999999,0.09699999999999999,-0.44299999999999995,1,0,6,0,1,0,76.0,3,3,0,11,27,32,5,1,39,0,67,16,1,8,4,113,123,57,1,18,24,21,8,2,1,8,6,6,2,1,30,47,7,4,11,8,2,16,18,13,0,2,53,18,132,19,103,52,18,113,0,3,4,3,125,41,1,9,56,467,162,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03644367307372772,0.04393666584752348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0657551627976798,0.06841764124365123,0.0,0.0,0.02795785028436886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038626464853527435,0.09483872241522197,0.034327147145924115,0.0,0.04540542953503116,0.0349836349398031,0.0,0.0,0.18180293932524447,0.044884106395883104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4198036977525808,0.0,0.20958422255966688,0.0,0.0,0.03541470300121441,0.0,0.0444279124280793,0.0,0.09847474802979476,0.0,0.04516005460824861,0.10605641959278272,0.0,0.03541006061789595,0.0,0.042668193331134606,0.0,0.0,0.08416059249046916,0.0,0.0,0.0481834412256957,0.2013725628090574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03641339463799415,0.04248011212221088,0.04585120747960638,0.08146308208832945,0.0371885308092466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11627137069742467,0.0,0.06236301310399466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03757600018352773,0.0,0.0,0.04507763824424792,0.0317633478906569,0.03800776285202625,0.0644386159901491,0.07887754448988643,0.07009539432803874,0.0,0.03288135194269936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0736572925448821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027556783466252142,0.0,0.08247820361747286,0.08166780407838517,0.0809748896364307,0.0948764082646906,0.0,0.0,0.08881692078623435,0.08582135455740053,0.0,0.03654260120468005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06702420672747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04204022720185094,0.02903891276611997,0.040170896129455035,0.04120543791333767,0.07260602685083703,0.036383191303873186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07421111478004516,0.03890155873576314,0.0274428545669119,0.0416815333963942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04143164202725811,0.0,0.0,0.4815036059873053,0.03281553539834617,0.0,0.0906670608610105,0.030484332913098263,0.0317084269967814,0.0,0.04372351707211037,0.038581214071997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0557176693746857,0.218874895958428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04452073632977882,0.11773934900746445,0.0,0.0,0.042953720700319435,0.0,0.0,0.0463480678065624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046572348942795085,0.07021955123013393,0.117321956720392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0655225397933799,0.0,0.042889212490316894,0.09289064781653013,0.0,0.0,0.0924241483179185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04602197983750153,0.0,0.04382036151259605,0.0,0.03437181771697987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09273425302397932,0.09913379949890096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026343173864388062,0.0,0.0,0.14383786997149894,0.0,0.0,0.15713868779567527,0.04567740297612475,0.16747577626543228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033922045927985686,0.04849833212149438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038111618247425344,0.0,0.0,0.04727724538119976,0.0,0.0,0.029930325924707974,0.0,0.08379412127739917,0.02920507824602555,0.04494996910143032,0.0,0.15885027424415624
alcoholism,ladysniper37,2020/04/12,"Should i go to the hospital? I’m f(19) &amp; i’ve been drinking since i was 13. I lost my job officially on february 12th from depression &amp; alcohol. I haven’t had a job since &amp; i’ve been drinking basically CONSTANTLY. i’ve been drinking every single day for the past 5 or 6 days. I recently went to the hospital for alcohol withdrawls about 3 weeks ago. i almost had a seizure, had major tremors &amp; hallucinations. ( all they gave me was fluids &amp; this pill for the tremors) Tonight i drank again and i’m afraid the same thing will happen. I don’t want to spend another 3-4,000 dollars on hospital bills but i am having major anxiety &amp; worry that i’m gonna have tremors &amp; the same symptoms again. I want to just take another shot to calm myself down but i know it’s literally the worst option. I know alcoholism can kill people &amp; when it gets as bad as my situation is, you’re damn near close to the end. I just need advice on what to do.

alcoholism,rockclimber1234,2020/04/12,"Advice for the daughter of an alcoholic father How to deal with abusive alcoholic father

Hi, so I (22F) really have never written about this and rarely talk about it. Basically, my father has been an alcoholic for ~17 years. After 2 duis, he finally went to rehab last year, and was doing fine, or so we thought. 

Background: He has anger management issues, rage, and I am pretty sure depression. He has been violent with my mom, my siblings, and me in the past. He doesn’t eat healthy, doesn’t exercise, and spends 12+ hours a day on his computer. He is actually one of the smartest people I know, which is what makes me so upset by this. My extended family act like they care about us, but they don’t at all. They are very wealthy and we are well off, but we aren’t as wealthy as them and thus they treat us like shit. They also hate my mother for no reason. My father has also called me a failure many times, even though I know that I very much am not. 

Yesterday, in a fit of rage, my father cut his left wrist in front of us. We called the paramedics and he is currently in a hospital. Alcohol had been found in his system. I thought he had been sober for one year. I also think my father does this for attention ie he wants us all to dope over him and tell him that without him we would be nothing, we love him, he hasn’t done anything wrong, we will always be there for him, and just shit like that. He wants us to pay more attention to him and just like ?? I don’t even know. But how long can we take this abuse? 

My question is that for some reason, I blame myself and I feel guilty for not trying to help him and trying not to care. I have cared for so many years, and I cry all the time from this. I don’t know how to stop feeling guilty for not caring. EDIT- I am planning on getting therapy after the social distancing/covid19 lockdown ends. I just don’t know what to do now that he is depressed suicidal alcoholic and abusive. I think my parents will get a divorce, and we are reliant on him to pay my tuition. I just feel very depressed sad guilty angry and just confused. This seriously messes with my brain and with this lockdown, I can’t even go back to my apartment (I am at my best away from family)

Another thing is that I also get very very angry about the past, and the present. I get angry because my father is depressed due to neglect from extended family members, I feel guilty because I feel like I am not good enough, and I feel like I am a failure. When I get angry, I get delirious and I break things. This only happens inside my house and has never happened outside of it. Only happens in front of my family. Could this be due to childhood trauma? 

How do I cope with the fact that I feel the shame of my father’s actions and my father feels no shame for his actions at all. He justifies his behavior because he had a hard life growing up, was poor, and now he has worked super hard to get where he is and we should be eternally grateful and we aren’t. (His words) He just will manipulate us and make especially me feel guilty about all of this. In the past he has said that I am the reason he drinks and if I was good enough he would not and says stuff like this to my mother as well. 

After this incident last night, my aunt, who doesn’t speak to my family called us and told us that my parents need to get a divorce, they blame my mother for my dads alcoholic actions. I believe the real reason he is depressed is because my dads extended family has never accepted us and they never will (rich vs middle class). They don’t care about us, and this makes me feel bad about myself.

I just don’t know how to make myself not care. I want to run away and cut everyone out of my life, but I need to finish my undergrad degree. I don’t know how I will make it. I was gone for an entire year (2018) and backpacked Europe, but then I had to come back. I have 2 years of undergrad left, tuition free, and that is the only thing that is keeping me here. My mental health is taking a large toll, and I know what I have to do, but I get very sad and angry about all of this.

Any advice is welcome.

My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me 7 or 8months ago due to alcohol and unfaithfulness but I don’t think I care. At least that’s what I tell myself. Started hooking up with a coworker maybe about a week after we broke up, (shes in a relationship for 4+ yrs, it was scummy but fuck it ig?) that lasted 6 months. Afterwards I started drinking a lot to my own surprise, and now it’s getting way out of hand. Crazy thing though is I’m aware of it but just can’t seem to stop. I’m heavily considering AA but I really can’t see myself not drinking.

alcoholism,huewutm8,2020/04/12,"Long-time alcoholic with a question I've been a heavy drinking alcoholic for the better part of 15 years. There have only been two things in those years that have been able to keep me from getting blacked out wasted daily, the gym (former bodybuilder) and work. 4 years ago my brain surgery killed my bodybuilding dream and goals, emptied my bank account and put me in a bad spot. I quit the gym but still had work which at least kept me from drinking to the point of not being able to perform the next day,  24 beers a night for the most part but a few times I was able to get myself down to 12 or even 6 but for a short period. I started lifting again recently and had an intense work schedule which kept me near six beers a night for a couple months and then here comes covid. No gym and no work... A few years ago I started to get some yellow in my eyes and fingers on occasion, a few  weeks ago underneath my nail, my fingertips have turned red starting a few weeks ago.

 as of a few days ago, It's really hard to get past drink 3 (yet I'm still managing 12 +) drinking is causing some pretty extreme nausea. Is this potentially coming from further liver damage?

alcoholism,Throwawaggy411,2020/04/12,"DT's or Panic/anxiety Attack So let me provide some context:

I have been drinking for a long period of time now. About 4 years of heavy consumption, strictly at night in order to help my sleep. 

Recently (1 week ago) i experienced a pretty severe anxiety attack.
After which, I have consistently been getting anxiety.

Now during this i have kept my drinking habits the same. Havent quit, i know probably bad for my anxiety attacks.

Every morning since i wake up with an intense panic attack, followed by a day of anxiety until the last hours of the night.

Upon looking up the symptoms of DTs i found them to be very similar to my panic and anxiety disorders:


-Feeling of dread and death

-Intense shaking (legs and arms)

-Doubting whether or not what i heard was actually there

-Panic that is unable to shake and without clear causation.

-Dissocation

-Weird sensation of instant panic when attempting to fall back asleep

-unable to consistently eat 


Now when i rationalize eveything, it doesnt make sense that it would be DT's. I have not quit drinking and i have a relatively coherent stream of thought.

alcoholism,SoulOfAMachine,2020/04/12,"Withdrawal or DTs? (or neither) Started buying vodka instead of beer because of the pandemic and it turned out to be a horrible idea. After having a couple of drunken angry meltdowns within a few days of each other I decided to stop drinking. For the first couple days I only had a few drinks a day and generally felt fine. Yesterday I didn't drink at all and I still felt fine (although depressed, bored, and anxious). Today I felt fine until this afternoon when my hands started to get shaky. I started to feel really out of it and went to the store (to buy beer -- NOT vodka). Everything felt so surreal like I was in a dream. I almost felt like I didn't recognize my surroundings.

I don't know if this is something to be concerned about because I didn't think that I drank enough to have problems stopping. Maybe this is just normal withdrawals? It was totally unexpected since I felt fine the past couple of days but I looked it up and apparently DTs don't start until a few days after you stop drinking.",4.100161917098447,6.088338326424871,5.19416774611399,79.30762467616582,72.47150259067358,7.933808290155443,29.16094559585493,8.660442795831766,2.474440673575129,799,33,141,15,16,263,110,193,0.09699999999999999,0.8370000000000001,0.066,-0.7602,1,0,9,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,0,1,6,10,0,1,11,0,14,8,1,0,2,36,32,15,0,3,6,0,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,7,3,11,9,3,1,7,4,0,1,14,9,17,6,26,16,8,31,0,1,1,0,1,7,0,5,25,103,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09763477122729264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11015018673550918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11887336183274025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3236543222465293,0.0,0.3144055590428789,0.0,0.08397884784011267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3820617195502606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10074625148591593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08762905126603017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049300244967334664,0.0,0.5617067276068628,0.0,0.0,0.08293566306629871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05094108503661871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11006856908864524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053584879896684035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526969213804548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08187762864143522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09795446849392572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095531847753173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07415512211167538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307726582554582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932968216661158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062462663247544785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065515956341883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07506226621668208,0.0,0.0,0.2760513728712376,0.0,0.07786570354434827,0.2445496223113093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062475730088556114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09242106558620736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10605483190583112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09038588847044936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,DimebagSK46,2020/04/13,"40 hours sober I have been drinking every night for the last 4-5 months(with a few days without but for the most part every night) and now Im 40 hours sober. I've read and heard a lot about the dangers of quitting cold turkey, and I feel like theres a lot of false information. To clarify I am functioning and I never drink during the day/work hours nor do i drink when I first wake up. 
Basically what Im asking is, should I be worried about quitting cold turkey? I'm not experiencing any negative symptoms as of yet(no shaking or anxiety or anything like that).
Sorry if this is posted in the wrong Subreddit but I just need some info. Thanks in advance!

Edit: I would also like to clarify, I am still planning on seeking help but I need to know if medical detox is necessary or not in my situation.",2.6211320754717,4.816406584905664,4.3515471698113215,82.74392452830193,77.49056603773585,7.258867924528303,26.32327044025157,8.238735603445708,1.8879489308176087,633,25,122,12,15,213,103,159,0.102,0.767,0.131,0.7676,0,0,3,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,5,8,7,1,1,8,0,11,7,1,0,1,29,19,16,0,6,12,0,1,3,0,2,3,1,0,0,3,4,3,0,4,4,0,2,6,3,0,1,2,5,12,4,17,14,6,20,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,9,15,81,15,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10161234941027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08640729430162848,0.0,0.09720295647378588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10456214006332143,0.0,0.11878688627763803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638904309008007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734205195735747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21411235603646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06424694283243873,0.09077393462238788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807984437646014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08516774625930262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753948022839681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27449999679093073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06983058030819915,0.10357342029389914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18622990013069568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21604908041716034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280027486752885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884314207865688,0.09799892894069996,0.0,0.0,0.2384803040952712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375970014662822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12169136732927355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702945858109589,0.1270975279156975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14282429627196258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14223678557953826,0.0,0.0,0.1014727899939647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13206725700332922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11698267044136612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248433542419306,0.0,0.09250348129111476,0.12903878933021948,0.0,0.09026201104300624,0.13892359997248893,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,LotsaLuv2ya,2020/04/13,"Damn this limbo between tapering and kindling! I know that alcohol reduces your immune system's ability to fight things off.  Plus, it's unnecessary and nonessential during these times.  But how the hell else am I going to pass the time?  It's just me and my husband, isolating from our hard-hit area (Santa Clara County).  Every time I see a teeny tiny bit of good news, a slew of bad news comes in.  I don't even know what to believe anymore.  Sigh... rant paused.

alcoholism,ghostofstarburyy,2020/04/13,"Day 1 I’ve felt since I was 16 that drinking unlocked this lovable person in me. Now 22 and out of college, that person’s spirit is dead, the party is over, but I’m drinking more than ever.

After speaking with a sober friend, I’m ready to quit. I’m hungover writing this and my drinking is beginning to scare my parents.

If you have anything to say to someone who is just now learning how to be sober, please reach out. For me, I feel that every friendship, client relationship, family gathering, and event involves booze and I’ve always been the one to dive right in. Now that I realize what it’s doing to me and my body, I am ready to quit. I have so many traumatic experiences, jealousies, headaches, broken relationships , and ruined opportunities from alcohol that i don’t want to even start.

alcoholism,PrestigiousGoose0,2020/04/13,"Where to go from here Hi, I'd really appreciate some insights on my situation, and sorry if my english is subpar.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, my girlfriend told me she was worried about my alcohol use. In the last 3-4 months, I've had a rough time, college decided to kick me out despite proving good grades like they asked last semester, ended up losing my student job and my laptop was accidentally destroyed, which contained a lifetime project. I slowly fell in a pattern of drinking maybe 4-6 days a week to help me calm down my anxiety and sleep easier. Of course, as I felt better in the last weeks, I didn't lose this bad habit as I was used to it.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend confronted me about this and I immediately told her I'd stop from now on. So for the last 7 days, I stopped drinking, and suffered through a mild withdrawal, feeling better every day. However, to help me cope with the withdrawal, I chose to chat and game with friends. They all are drinking most nights due to the quarantine, and it's slowly making me crave beer more and more every night. The thing is I use these games and chats to think about anything else than alcohol. I don't want to tell my friends, because I fear they will change how they act around me and how they see me.

&amp;#x200B;

So now for my question : More and more I feel like I'm growing more anxious to be exposed to the envy of having a beer, and I'd like to try to drink more casually, but this worries my girlfriend, who fears I might relapse. I don't want to isolate from my friends, since it's the only thing that helps me power through this, but I feel like I just quit drinking coffee, and every day I'm being shoved coffees in my face more and more and it's increasingly difficult. I intend to eventually drink beer casually like I used to and I think I have the willpower, but I thought quarantine was going to be helping me quit alcohol for a while, like a month, and I'm concerned with the fact that my main solution of gaming and chatting is exposing me a lot more to drinking than my social activities. before the quarantine.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I crazy to think I should tamper gradually with my withdrawal? I quit alcohol because I couldn't quit on my own bad habits and my girlfriend noticed me of it, so I fear my judgement might be clouded, I'd appreciate some insight.

&amp;#x200B;

alcoholism,themodsarebitches,2020/04/14,"Will the cops pursue my Fake ID? Please Read: I don’t know where else to post this and I need advice, kinda stressing right now. I live in Colorado. Went in at 10am to buy a couple shooters at a local liquor store. He recognized that my ID is fake and said he is going to confiscate it and make a call so I said “Its okay bro” while motioning that he can keep it and I left. He went to the parking lot and saw my license plate. The car doesn’t belong to me, its a family members, and I had permission to be driving it, but not for that purpose. With the corona virus going around, I am worried that they are going to come to the house or call the owner of the vehicle and slap me with a $600 failure to stay home ticket and a misdemeanor charge. The ID does not have my real name on it. What do y’all think?

alcoholism,JanTabakFeyenoord,2020/04/14,"Falling back, how to make it not too bad? So I've had a very bad period, a few years ago, drinking 1L of vodka, everyday, for a year, I quit after that though and didn't drink anymore because I started working out and alcohol is not very good for you.

&amp;#x200B;

However, schools are closed, gym is closed, no job, I picked up drinking again. It started with 1 beer, now I feel like I have to drink alcohol to sleep again. However, I'm still at 1 beer a day, but I bought the 0,5L beers today and I'm just scared it will return to my old level of abuse. Do you fellow drinkers have any tips how to, well, not become an alcoholic again during these times?",4.875,4.945456348484849,5.416212121212124,85.61931818181819,68.84848484848484,8.721212121212123,29.37878787878788,8.472884824447931,1.904860606060606,506,17,108,7,8,163,92,132,0.113,0.823,0.063,-0.8162,3,0,12,0,1,0,26.0,0,2,0,2,13,6,0,1,6,0,9,11,1,4,0,17,16,8,0,0,5,0,1,1,1,1,3,0,0,0,5,7,10,0,1,9,1,1,5,3,1,0,3,1,9,3,14,12,1,26,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,0,20,65,14,3,0.0,0.15591570181994352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166488918280151,0.4218973788423768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425805170630411,0.15989940124794386,0.0894874741897579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13050449000730166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10118657953548947,0.21974863324497929,0.0802176219028009,0.1453336777421225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486633462903895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5156425643205058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665371677814515,0.0940097731016514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11037362172522168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13058534121675086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428949282581088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783907613679558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13808428770106412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13996491827966906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13174713982075364,0.13317872719870402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13168762531222175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18628382602564764,0.0,0.10509001293165712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12928905224735365,0.0,0.07673269788665156,0.0,0.1247343892819296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21715533766497025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11831754268938405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09580097330215066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15989940124794386,0.1694826279783454
alcoholism,Forestiere2019,2020/04/14,"130 days of sobriety - how I got here and where I think I’m going I hit a rough patch in my life last year and I spiraled into a really dark place. I was drinking 750ML of rum pretty much every day. I didn’t go to therapy or AA because I was too ashamed. But I had support from all of my friends. After some time it dawned on me that I was also babying myself in a lot of ways. Wore big sweaters. Applied Vick’s vapo rub to my temples. Watched soothing movies. Slept 13 hours. The whole nine yards. After even more time, during a rare moment of sobriety I booked a trip to England (I live in California) and I just fucking left with no return date. Everything immediately became about surviving in England. For me personally it became super easy to not want to drink because my thoughts were elsewhere. 


Im home now and I still have urges to drink especially in this lockdown due to COVID 19 but I’ve developed a routine for myself that I stick to every day and it’s been helpful in keeping me sober. I’ve resigned myself to the fact that a relapse is likely, but I have the tools to get through a relapse. I think I had such a hard time back then because I didn’t accept my internal sadness, I spent months pushing it away.

alcoholism,c120894,2020/04/14,"3 days venting I’m new here and it’s only been 3 days since I’ve had a drink. I really want to quit for good. I was making bad decisions, I just lost the only friend I had left and I wasn’t being the best mom I could be. The last couple days weren’t bad but today I just keep thinking about all the bad decisions I’ve ever made like everything keeps replaying in my head even stuff from high school and childhood which I don’t care about now. I just keep thinking how everyone hates me and it’s just eating me up inside. I have this non stop stress and anxiety that I would normally drink to not feel. My mind is non stop racing and I feel super panicky. I went to one AA meeting last year and I had the worst panic attack ever. I tried to speak when it was my turn but my voice started shaking and I literally left crying. So embarrassing. So I just went back to drinking hopefully reading stuff here helps since it’s not in person. I deleted all my social media today too since I was making an even bigger fool out of myself on there. Also my husband drinks everyday and refuses to quit with me which is probably going to make this even harder.",2.4178388278388283,4.359759367521367,3.934346764346767,86.70192307692308,77.11965811965813,6.850305250305251,21.826617826617827,7.793537801064563,0.9741540903540904,908,25,183,14,21,301,136,234,0.221,0.679,0.1,-0.9865,1,0,4,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,5,23,19,2,4,7,0,17,6,1,5,4,47,39,16,0,5,9,2,2,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,11,11,5,6,6,5,0,4,5,12,1,1,13,4,29,7,18,22,4,32,0,1,0,0,9,9,0,1,20,121,40,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372375704092812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07052456899504594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048786477839172,0.0,0.07088788805754996,0.23092266660925334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09674699208931237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09399314454527298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360566166495623,0.10200571685778123,0.10126562697860264,0.17836343287781198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612417036435127,0.0,0.09433267811735607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826705072623468,0.16678101572195986,0.0,0.08809083536469776,0.08285380646160541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932273691434279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712252313906489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05239330876602258,0.07732401843487248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910178565527059,0.09461282757419856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617925505057718,0.09740306642445386,0.0,0.0915647850263316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458262808485438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15029318223545768,0.0,0.0,0.20032790778044268,0.0,0.0,0.04503903967931173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10063552087722556,0.0,0.0,0.08723175314988328,0.18461123870917645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930849217972802,0.10797100441029232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08903700902853788,0.0,0.0,0.09032594910369987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062469861606228624,0.1402282472949523,0.0,0.10816429072824978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08049614864664759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09939566740334503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19610935569797366,0.09221425666211808,0.0,0.059058831940072914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933005023852746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22877984700450396,0.0,0.0,0.09397539077648237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06525206735349078,0.0,0.0,0.154148780452026,0.10560254189940788,0.0,0.21106940524237652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181423734370924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17476937089751213,0.0,0.0,0.06259048929548708,0.100275495284863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054375642947103384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1709208259588664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06548864002043825,0.0,0.0,0.059366892403031224

alcoholism,itanj96,2020/04/15,"Unsure of what I’m dealing with For starters, I’m a 23 year old male. Started drinking in high school casually, and then the same In college until I was about 20. I would then start to drink alone and try to cope with family stuff. It wasn’t until I was 21 and could buy my own that I would drink more frequently. I would say the last 2 year’s I drink about 3-5 days a week, most of them alone, unless it’s a wine night or a dinner party or going out. When I’m alone I like to drink and then I’ll over drink because it’s like I’m chasing this feeling that I can’t seem to ever get, and that’s why I keep drinking, because I think it’s reachable. What usually happens is I’ll drink 6 to 8 beers, depending, and then wake up dehydrated, but not hungover. Sometimes I’ll force myself to stay awake to drink more to feel “good”. Mind you I’m not dealing with any crazy stress or anything like that - life is generally good.

Can anyone else relate? Or potentially give advice?",2.255285381479325,3.8604972425742585,3.5896622015142685,90.49025334886431,76.57425742574256,6.337099592312173,23.26849155503785,7.048011613610866,0.6514323820617358,761,23,167,8,17,249,117,202,0.068,0.825,0.107,0.8081,0,3,11,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,1,0,4,7,0,1,6,0,11,14,1,1,1,33,27,19,0,4,8,0,2,3,0,3,1,1,0,1,12,10,12,1,4,12,1,1,4,1,0,0,3,3,14,6,24,20,5,28,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,7,23,91,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08456207876147563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2688759157570084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05884751779637674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06050805559783716,0.0886664643495346,0.07121183978662758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055032109297903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909203709911159,0.0,0.0,0.055808627772927236,0.17842984574166687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7629519306933339,0.0,0.0,0.0722898103633742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0782768598572044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08157853681799124,0.0,0.08751050804801051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04521154240739687,0.08301331568576062,0.04918046181671252,0.14516475579481564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07652359049219526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914301444581627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07691726484137486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0705384741327558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061123009044336235,0.1268315071167786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08737679581579791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08120827097271642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09080508363279306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881698276941302,0.0,0.08757915663487942,0.0,0.07877921851339767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08558641903586213,0.0,0.12250139884355032,0.09223597228424643,0.0,0.0,0.09912681412859513,0.0,0.09906313487048504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055448840916941015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0587523338644783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09530729222309964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06941404241141215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808537353501589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18441829514930047,0.0,0.0,0.11145282685019496
alcoholism,doodsy,2020/04/15,"A little help or something please Hi. So about a month ago I posted that I was quitting my daily vodka routine and had dumped out my stash. I dont have the original post anymore cuz I deleted it (didnt want my family to accidently find it) so a little about me and background. 
I'm a 20 y/o male university student who's fairly  ""successful"" by society's dumb standards. I used to drink because it helped with all the stress of work, school and life in general. I stopped cuz it was digging into my bank account too much and a close friend made me promise to dump it all out one day. 

I'm happy to say I havent had a drink since march 6th. However, my job has disappeared. My uni friends have moved back to their home countries/cities and video calling isnt the same as in person chats. My finances are dwindling. My laptops fucking with me so I cant do much work and I cant spend precious money on fixing it. Wifi is fucking slow so when my laptop works, I cant get much done. I wrecked my hamstring on a run so I cant excercise anymore.

I SO NEED A FUCKIN DRINK!!! 
But I feel like if I take that drink I probably wont be able to come back from it cuz when i drink i dont stop. 

Idk why I'm posting but im hoping someone can somehow stop me or tell me what to do. Sorry if I come across as pathetic and childish. Also, sorry for the length. I hope it doesnt scare yall away.

alcoholism,Do_unto_udders,2020/04/15,"Today's my first day back to normal after a five day binge that ended early last week. I'm posting here so I don't forget how much better this feels. I hope this helps some of you tough it out too. :) No panic attacks.  Very, very little anxiety.  Remember...  I used to have 50+ a day EVERY DAY for years.  When I'm sober I have three or fewer per *month.*  

I've gotten so much done today!  Since I'm stuck at home I'm doing some inexpensive decorating of my apartment.  When I broke up with my ex fiance I got some things from the dollar tree to decorate my new place.  I was working the longest hours I ever had and didn't have time to make the place my own, though.  Yesterday and today I've put those peel-off wall stickers on some walls, hung up my pictures, added lighting, planted a hibiscus, succulents, and sowed some seeds to repot in a few weeks.  It's even cleaner than it was in here!  I've always been artistic and great with interior decorating but alcohol-induced apathy and depression made me not care much about it.  Now it looks so good that it's a shame we have to stay away from people.  I'd love to show it off!

I went to the dollar tree earlier for some AA batteries for my string lights (they're little green leaves!).  I drove past the grocery store where they have my favorite non-liquor drinks on sale.  I ALMOST went in.  But I reminded myself of how that last binge (which really wasn't bad at all compared to how I used to drink daily...) sucked.  And not only the recovery...  But how when I drink now, and for the last few years, it hasn't been fun.  I just go into autopilot.  The lights are on but no-one's home.  I just feel hollow and depressed the whole time and each time I drink those feelings intensify.  It's such an empty feeling.  It's the exact opposite of fulfillment in every way.  A waste of time, a waste of money, a waste of a previously good feeling, a waste of the confidence and self-esteem I'm slowly gaining.

I hope you're all having a great day!  I'm here if anyone needs to chat.  Stay strong.  If you screw up realize that you did, but don't focus on that.  Focus on your goal and making a plan for acting differently next time.  That's what's finally been helping me out.  :) &lt;3",1.9811152338646456,4.1064549505617975,3.507619545335775,88.34711000783906,79.26966292134831,6.5665011758557625,20.68591586098772,7.65591337171366,0.754089626339169,1723,46,356,27,43,568,232,445,0.122,0.728,0.15,0.953,2,0,5,0,0,0,74.0,1,4,1,7,25,21,3,2,24,0,21,6,0,9,4,62,51,30,0,6,12,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,23,18,4,0,7,7,6,6,8,10,1,3,17,10,35,11,50,34,16,76,0,3,2,2,11,28,2,12,38,218,58,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771415758627382,0.08218714054661277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06829370925132491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0627878255064064,0.0,0.0,0.05738936544488736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09337316527048928,0.07711299343743774,0.0631112874463334,0.06852993362523238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07258944829798057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368183234018202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.264660771412451,0.0,0.14138367476296354,0.0,0.0,0.08575182831350361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0839921239960846,0.0,0.32161247317369823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0726948705350665,0.0,0.0,0.05421034635442985,0.07424233470797416,0.1383049419202424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20750016163197232,0.0,0.0,0.08991011750642784,0.0,0.06981370377658051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04664561549798884,0.13768271245398092,0.06564358105735123,0.1809779005502162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100274679884891,0.0,0.1646576045310815,0.16303974137491786,0.08082821139352976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20070839642420216,0.0,0.08690650880856003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16452319286515207,0.0,0.0,0.06892307001069628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07407668846630111,0.07766218458956524,0.10957257787620607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06551218640935462,0.0,0.1810056523598324,0.06085822693809734,0.0,0.07926939882310903,0.08728863223255698,0.0,0.08041693854835248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06242240716737425,0.0,0.09629836394670667,0.0,0.0,0.07835071698268264,0.05690108264933597,0.0,0.17150365662700726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07860600762248438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08250893148311945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05257991204066717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09297597520275924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08562304559436404,0.0,0.0,0.06789401820194131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17496394052941042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05452756936977175,0.0,0.08063913789263832,0.0,0.2392955357858811,0.0,0.23339501935591225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417744203663503,0.0,0.1354423975866557,0.0,0.06514801525781824,0.1316726444965399,0.0,0.0,0.15217033083137338,0.0,0.09163479177887597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059752220022319925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057083548095408

alcoholism,2ndcummingofchrist,2020/04/15,"Same ol' song and dance 

So i spent the majority of my younger years being wild. The tail end of it was mostly spent doing as much heroin as i could. Luckily i got arrested before i overdosed for the last time. I pleaded with the probation officer and she sent me to a state rehab, i got clean, and I've been off drugs since '09. I never did like alcohol too much, but after i got off probation I told myself that "" shit i got off heroin and everything else. I deserve a couple of vices."" (alcohol and cigarettes). It's worked for a long time. I've been functional. I got married, bought a house by 30.

The thing is though that its getting old. I'm not in my 20's anymore and it's wearing on me. The problem is that over time drinking has become part of my identity. Me and my wife's first date was at a piano bar. The alcoholic me is the only person shes ever known. Things that i enjoy are intertwined with having a beer. Mowing, have a beer. Work on the house, have a beer. Bad day, have a beer. Great day, celebrate with a beer... etc.

Whats really gotten me in the last couple of years is having a job where i work 4, 10 hour days. I've pretty much stopped drinking on my days when i work the next day, but the days I'm off is fair game. I start drinking at about 3-4 do some work around the house, finish the 12th beer at about 2, wake up at noon. Rinse repeat. The thing that really gets me is though, those four days at work. I don't drink and shit does it feel good not to wake up hung over. I tell myself that shit if i feel this good I'm not drinking the rest of the week. I wake up the last work day of the week and am excited. ""I'm not going to drink the rest of the week. I feel great."" Then by the time i get off i head to the corner store for some beer. Insane autopilot.

I've also started some programming classes recently trying to better our situation and I've been kicking ass at it when I'm sober. Feeling good using my full potential. . Then back to my old ways, getting behind on homework because I'm too hung over to think.

My problem is though even though i love my wife to death, and would share anything with her ( actually now that i think about it, i keep aaaalot of shit to myself. Blame it on the emotionally distant upbringing...). I can't bear to confide in her with this. So here i am, drinking once again, calling out to a room full of strangers for some assemblance of understanding.

Just as a note, and no offense meant, I've been to AA and NA but i cant stand all they teach. Higher power and all that nonsense. ""Sometimes all you can do for the day is be sober."" I don't believe in that. We are the ones that get sober, albeit with the help of others. I do need help no doubt, but not from some man in the sky. I will admit however how ironic it is that the only time i reach out for help to quit drinking is when I'm drinking. If there was a god, hes got a sick sense of humor.

I'm reposting here because apparently you'll get blocked for posting when you're drinking in r/stopdrinking. Isnt that the point? The people who are drinking need the advice to quit drinking?",1.8686132127192965,3.641081926562503,3.373009868421054,90.87819627192984,78.171875,6.491228070175438,22.3218201754386,7.409481684899262,0.7160520833333326,2403,71,527,32,57,791,281,640,0.124,0.7659999999999999,0.11,-0.8797,4,0,26,0,0,0,92.0,2,2,1,12,28,21,5,1,47,0,47,37,10,2,5,70,90,37,1,8,12,2,4,1,0,3,6,1,3,2,30,24,23,3,10,23,4,3,13,9,1,3,21,5,61,12,82,63,20,94,0,0,0,2,27,38,5,9,50,340,91,12,0.0,0.0,0.04823932661199056,0.0,0.0,0.04830520468626996,0.0,0.15848603563739672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03953142883236215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04902409991474448,0.0,0.0,0.04067902004492871,0.04400571302893713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038010807022053686,0.04127436133319117,0.0602676078174181,0.0545946943144137,0.04206371077432607,0.05569388924935355,0.0,0.04371933488820287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050476462364881236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0394681048898768,0.1093930070389342,0.0,0.2869208638888541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04325901637845458,0.0,0.0,0.5811044338504185,0.05732640710139001,0.0,0.04129479948316132,0.0556052979132074,0.043782828828381366,0.0,0.05513068991814245,0.0326499283607411,0.044714839003264166,0.0,0.0,0.044427054250761336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09997892827072824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04204755328439421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15495972962052354,0.0,0.02809382538150043,0.12438577689794597,0.2372157748101029,0.10899977375553208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05073236104613607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09940138338309147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04868139550836744,0.17111660080863308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04905447172624343,0.04393818454429173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12088310083475301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024150391450780462,0.0,0.0,0.04374651286770232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044615073215226383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10901648817734977,0.07330765742389438,0.038125658028289273,0.0,0.05257239218629663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10374291208730896,0.05264436733785703,0.033496975566277384,0.07519181334111645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0535309546780443,0.0,0.03427051102021995,0.04316285413584686,0.0,0.0,0.046730017277327236,0.0,0.04734300166278612,0.05029097548748792,0.0,0.09460111453222872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10515583238427488,0.0,0.0,0.06333589348858927,0.0,0.048808971488113216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20296842289428896,0.04089136077314683,0.05556458970169867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048890348374165817,0.0,0.06997764520646975,0.0,0.0,0.04132807244652305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04320648596700631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0985229584387026,0.06334914300450001,0.19427007959349946,0.0,0.14412344922816991,0.0,0.0,0.04723520244728754,0.0,0.03356165736091904,0.0,0.0,0.05146133569797917,0.0,0.042694107118250085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03923749199286231,0.11895614118862904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25191390279232106,0.0,0.0,0.035115675274917414,0.0,0.0,0.06366626379949844
alcoholism,TheyTheirsThem,2020/04/15,"Sobriety in a nutshell (AA driven) Bob’s rules of AA

1)	We do not drink, no matter what.   This too shall pass.  The person, place, thing, event, or feeling which makes us desire a drink will usually be gone in a short period of time.   Drinking, and the consequences of drinking, will be there much longer, perhaps forever.

2)	Find 3 meetings a day where you feel comfortable, so that you have a place to go if you have the desire to drink, and so that you have a place to go when you want to avoid a particular person in the program.

3)	Do not call your sponsor at 2AM with a problem that you had at 10PM

4)	Every person in the program knows what day one is like, regardless of how far away they are from their own personal day one.  We have all been there, we all understand what the process of getting sober is like.

5)	Wisdom is the ability to recognize a mistake as we are making it again.

6)	Progress is stopping that mistake earlier in the process

7)	Doing or saying something harmful to another person and then apologizing is not the same as not doing or saying it in the first place.    See  # 6!

8)	We work the steps in order.  Parts of step 9 can be done prior to completing step 8, but only after consulting a sponsor, since the second part of step 9 emphasizes that we do not take actions which could injure them or others.

9)	When sharing at a meeting, we tell our story in the form of how it was, what happened, and what it is like now.  We speak using “I”, “me,” and sometimes “we.”  We use the progress in our lives to attract others to this way of life.  When we speak using  “I”, we internalize the event or feeling into our story.  As long as we are telling our story, we can never be wrong.  I cannot tell another what to do in a share.  I can only say what I did, and what the results were, good or bad.  It is then their decision to try what I did, or perhaps what another did.

10)	The word “you” shall never be spoken when sharing at a meeting.   “You” is NOT part of “our” story.   When we use “you” in a share, we are promoting the program, which is a violation of the 11th tradition.  When we share using “you,”  we separate ourselves from the event or feeling.  Nearly everyone coming into AA has a big problem with trust.  All of our lives we have heard you, you, you, and therefore we close off our eyes, ears, and minds when the word “you” is spoken.  We take on a defensive stance.  But when a person shares in the form of “I did, I thought, I felt,” we listen because they are talking about themselves and not us.   Basically, the word “you” in a share helps no one.

11)	If we employ the 12 traditions in our personal conduct in other affairs, we will always be at peace with our decisions.

12)	Here are the odds.   One in five people who need this program ever make it to their first meeting.  Of those, one in five make it to one year.  When a person leaves AA, their chance of getting back are one in five.   So for every person who shares at a meeting that they have left and come back, there are four people who left and never made it back.  The odds of coming back are not good, therefore it is best to not leave in the first place.    See  # 1!

13)	AA is for those who want it.  This program cannot be sold.  The only way a person gets sober is by being attracted to the changes they see in another.  The only way we can help a friend or family member is to get ourselves sober first.

14)	A person who is actively drinking is ten times more likely to get us drunk than we are to get them sober.   We never make a 12 step contact by ourselves.  Alcohol is cunning, baffling, and powerful.

15)	Go to meetings until you hear someone tell “your” story.  If you never hear your story, at least you have been to a lot of meetings.

16)	In the beginning, all we have is “our story.”  At the end, all we have is “our story.”  With work, the “what it is like now” part will be much better.

17)	We cannot give away what we don’t have.  We cannot keep that which we don’t give away.

18)	The Serenity Prayer can be shortened to “is it me or is it them?”   If its me, I work on it.  If its them, I let it go.  See #5.

19)	You can’t bullshit a bullshitter.  Don’t even try.  Its insulting.   ;-)

20)	Never make a major decision before consulting another member of the program.  If they think it is a good idea, then it probably is.  In the process of explaining my idea to another person, I often discover problems or issues I hadn’t considered when I first came up with it.",2.4043311155993834,4.138724281038375,3.899694071521921,87.86769959605562,76.5056433408578,6.920494237851965,24.411845075442557,7.7627490962704995,1.218398645598194,3387,113,705,50,76,1122,314,886,0.040999999999999995,0.8190000000000001,0.139,0.9979,2,1,8,0,0,0,140.0,47,22,13,15,32,36,3,1,65,0,93,12,2,17,12,154,150,54,0,18,28,0,5,5,1,6,3,10,0,12,59,57,8,4,16,7,1,17,26,12,5,18,19,20,100,24,100,113,20,123,0,0,5,0,141,52,0,19,55,536,159,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046248105562154584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0360084935157677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722673793906297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219756294370354,0.13310405363515732,0.03613304501442492,0.026380204512423268,0.0,0.03682406961098731,0.0,0.04541472872503095,0.038273461889907226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044188891793523616,0.049495383194028734,0.0,0.0,0.04577950031793506,0.11183344647974716,0.04537329997806114,0.0,0.0,0.0345517838327676,0.0,0.0,0.08372691226548162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04428562872692253,0.0,0.2543597524974189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03832904674511777,0.0,0.0,0.028582909415674162,0.03914496162581298,0.07292256723099369,0.0413513774935341,0.0,0.0,0.04079607560977457,0.0,0.0875251124187626,0.0,0.04155104816816887,0.0,0.03955281516176503,0.18404962384598814,0.0,0.0,0.03343436826436709,0.0,0.13565726288534646,0.08302716953333479,0.09837733879805273,0.1088917364347793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038268180644330116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975487547498998,0.0,0.05801300604481351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09770503056971776,0.0,0.04516814132906578,0.0,0.03846505066849582,0.0,0.0,0.02378295807663165,0.0,0.0,0.09164453046164957,0.09403742061048387,0.044251898226313764,0.0305666048415782,0.10571056137763928,0.0,0.07642571709695198,0.03829725446052334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036791089228946534,0.0,0.04094810928957504,0.17331948300427566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043695688935854834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06362460936024288,0.03208806629637097,0.20025934840565646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20527111282205496,0.1316511794931625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1874516123394482,0.0,0.06000325031632476,0.4534355859856584,0.2260672459910439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04665806320261797,0.12422577428444626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10324270114924544,0.0,0.0,0.1379391575856461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03579775269179114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03666699804322237,0.03331541908856245,0.04280035115053511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036180065634807856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06507523864713538,0.03478302488035409,0.15129798276059758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02875016820153033,0.027729047305283458,0.0,0.03435573255217564,0.05046831893103474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058762138868305225,0.0,0.0,0.04505108496451078,0.15616447379403586,0.18687970504268694,0.0476615988880909,0.0,0.05104975401017441,0.1030496912831297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09451474158367043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04731471712562167,0.0,0.02786785672099057
alcoholism,ExtendedCable,2020/04/16,"Tapering advice, please  

Hello, friends.

I'm 47 years old, been drinking since about 21. Highly functional alcoholic. Gainfully employed, no DUI, etc.

Mostly  beer, though lately vodka and whiskey. I don't drink all day - but  immediately after work until bedtime. Sometimes all day on the weekends.

I'd say I average 6-12 beers every night. Been this way for about 20 years.

I  need help tapering to avoid withdrawal and keep my life together. I'm  working from home during this pandemic, and have to have my mental  facilities in good shape.

I just  started taking Naltrexone 4 days ago, based on my friend's  recommendation. He's very much like me, only 10 years younger. It seems  to help me drink less, except last night when I got blackout drunk on  whiskey. Woke up today with mad hangxiety...

To  my point:

I need to taper down with as few side effects as possible. I  am on my first beer of the evening. I intend to stop at 3 or 4. I will  likely do this for a few days, then decrease by 1, and continue until I  can have  only 1 drink per night to keep the withdrawal away.

Please give me any advice. I'm scared and I want to get better. I cannot go to treatment, and am doing this myself.

I also appreciate any success stories from those who have done something similar.

TL;DR:  
Please help me taper as painlessly as possible and give me success stories!",3.052669683257921,5.624187294117646,4.245980392156863,82.0896040723982,78.01960784313725,7.217194570135746,26.278280542986426,8.263242389622931,2.045316742081448,1060,42,191,21,26,346,161,255,0.067,0.745,0.188,0.9855,1,1,12,0,0,0,44.0,0,0,0,8,7,11,1,2,4,0,15,12,0,2,2,26,32,19,0,3,4,0,0,2,2,1,2,1,1,0,7,9,11,4,2,12,0,1,3,3,0,1,5,1,24,8,36,26,8,40,0,0,0,0,11,13,0,3,27,111,31,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19111725650193692,0.0866843650367597,0.10450708338645748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07820211375887264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13300023270378947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09187632027838988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08648673982637818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25226418236915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10007246432972756,0.0,0.3831853657037022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906098291732527,0.06458894826982525,0.0,0.08239175120505164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08317957742363677,0.0,0.0,0.15110362985492878,0.0,0.05109090311920736,0.18761692450516726,0.055575945350284005,0.0820210733777457,0.07821108231699901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966384348027964,0.103319825070221,0.09809069869945884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17383934796093856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07971137802862761,0.11031065451852738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06907151508566327,0.09554988095998894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854867192715257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188642945499188,0.14501913881156558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2753060623784377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026134806198413,0.0,0.0,0.14874642567495944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3220300463998089,0.09244255102876496,0.22048561462861305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07776602195843288,0.09790420621920072,0.0,0.0,0.08902375823870079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089236694421932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07528302485955861,0.09671617490682467,0.0,0.06921581046590493,0.0,0.0,0.08175628147931037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07352542670693735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960775471128366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09269287657780624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068646116066322,0.05767869661200985,0.0776206401607903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14238363366270834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889194199897556

Thanks- I hope you are all well and we are all in this together",-0.31461538461538296,1.8827942051282065,1.1217948717948725,97.70653846153849,100.53846153846158,5.476923076923078,21.384615384615387,7.010146845296331,0.8031999999999999,300,12,67,6,13,95,63,78,0.068,0.7170000000000001,0.215,0.9197,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,1,2,0,1,5,5,0,0,1,0,10,6,2,2,2,12,16,5,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,6,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,4,0,7,4,6,12,4,7,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,4,7,41,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557178361183495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1948872946164839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2301098403766897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11635216966886774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14927189990628165,0.0,0.0,0.22119251129008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1815311770724876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10880054258736728,0.0,0.0,0.1970835274455744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20898996184627008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.445724004226687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4629435727529268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2050333164825973,0.0,0.0,0.14795276172217164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25596223423997216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17863744543988952,0.0,0.2002350971579096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2415099190601673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,silvercery,2020/04/16,"I took a sip of my boyfriend's afternoon coffee...bourbon I've (20f) been with my boyfriend (23m) for two years now, and honestly have had concerns about his drinking the entire time. But things are starting to escalate and I'm worried. 

The other day I picked him up from work, and he had an iced coffee with him. Very normal since he works at a coffee shop. We get home, and he goes out in the porch for a smoke. I see his coffee on the kitchen table and something inside of me tells me to take a sip. It's not just iced coffee. Its a Strong iced coffee/bourbon combo. That he was halfway done with at 2 pm on a Wednesday. I bring it up and he laughs it off. 

He drinks every night. We live together, so even before quarantine i saw him most nights and every night he would drink. But since quarantine has started he has had at least two drinks every single night. His drink is gin with grapefruit juice over ice. He makes a stiff drink, i wince a little when i take a sip. 

However, I don't really notice a big change in his behavior when he starts drinking. He never seems ""drunk"". I myself like to have a fun night of drinking maybe once every two weeks, and even when we're drinking together, like to get drunk together, he never seems that intoxicated. 

All the articles I've read said if he was an alcoholic I'd see a big change in his behavior when he's intoxicated, but i never do. 

How do i talk to him? What steps can we take in quarantine to better his health?",2.314149403640929,4.313002220338984,3.5511111111111116,89.06315128688011,77.64406779661017,6.675455116133082,22.112366603892028,7.662118739084242,0.8685266792215951,1145,33,239,17,27,372,152,295,0.012,0.9279999999999999,0.06,0.8959,1,3,12,0,0,0,41.0,3,0,0,4,11,7,0,0,19,0,18,17,0,3,4,35,36,18,0,3,6,0,0,2,0,1,5,1,3,0,9,16,13,1,2,13,1,3,5,0,0,3,10,4,29,7,31,25,4,42,0,0,3,0,30,17,0,4,24,139,38,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08053055606679728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06412074108483994,0.0,0.0,0.06664452805430786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15942917324943426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04859712428965393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07711334905067313,0.0,0.6643644770087244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09954127034058348,0.0,0.2539561271774933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07873875539957507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009782471880543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755862498050703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07362835892539422,0.0755245479857915,0.06653900112027153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05029940929070816,0.0,0.07570326514928262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17435305174833945,0.0,0.0,0.3535733268578445,0.07383096362886014,0.0,0.08579107817389,0.0,0.08024959723016775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537443555524552,0.0,0.04827372993251924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07167895144286372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12009483338543207,0.13719898253418694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12466728724000632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0580112242910072,0.0,0.0,0.16000793988732656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16997058876466994,0.06056672595022645,0.06586275554098613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05006187830054176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043939548851472526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08372111516426875,0.0,0.0,0.2208298539162097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06217497775057281,0.0,0.0,0.0604444685549338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10971728252397968,0.07652568913023107,0.0,0.053529350617744435,0.0,0.0,0.04852553355110125
alcoholism,Cstey,2020/04/16,"Medical Detox? So I drink between 18-20 beers a night. Then get up and work 8-5pm at my job. It’s very taxing on my body. Every now and then my body just can’t do it anymore and I’ll sleep almost 24 hours. The shakes have gotten really bad and it’s embarrassing when I’m trying to show someone something on my phone. Night sweats and just randomly get hot are really bad to. Also my left kidney has started to hurt, and gets worse everyday. 

With these signs, I was wondering if I would need to medically detox. I don’t know what I would do about work though. I’ve been wanting to quit so bad and swear I won’t drink the next morning, then when 5pm comes around it’s straight to the liquor store. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you.",0.8890092879256954,3.1716329473684226,2.2589009287925705,94.79260061919508,84.65789473684211,5.681733746130033,18.15170278637771,7.048011613610866,0.057793653250774124,576,14,129,8,17,185,101,152,0.14300000000000002,0.802,0.055,-0.9252,1,0,4,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,0,3,11,8,0,2,4,0,14,13,5,0,0,23,26,17,0,6,3,0,1,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,6,10,4,0,2,5,2,2,3,6,0,0,3,1,12,2,14,18,0,21,0,1,0,0,2,7,0,4,12,70,18,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12986692507548828,0.0,0.0,0.13307870079783474,0.0,0.0,0.10627892252278533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09037557137280526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13179965082170508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183078857431441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328942145432861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2952406587183552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11448033329380874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2603799682388279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11197276035067266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.208302021770197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14652112068969594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13087830150220495,0.0,0.1422706465856811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318813044197792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0730375675532421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443946635704536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677626152356159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854259096881997,0.0,0.0,0.14133911576276914,0.24943257300170185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14135396686747526,0.0,0.0,0.17027642854828087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329945278719474,0.0,0.11260451025172648,0.10231179672457606,0.0,0.0,0.09406627780598943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12235512947494047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13057215073839226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902293918472627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965522211807124,0.0783870081484535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14412280854169027,0.1935034546151861,0.0,0.13543497642165095,0.28322195089667584,0.0,0.0,0.0

My dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember and when I was younger still living at the house can you get very drunk and angry sometimes he would verbally and physically abuse my siblings and my mom. my mom for help but her dad was also an alcoholic so she doesn’t understand that living this way isn’t right. I also went to my grandma on my dad side for help and she acted like her little baby boy couldn’t do something like this. I am not really worried about the past but whenever I have a friend over at my house my dad is always wasted. It is humiliating to i’m getting an apartment in my college town in August. Thankfully I now live six hours away but I still can’t help worrying about this because he’s my dad. I want him to get help and to stop drinking because it’s caused me a lot of pain in my life and my siblings and my moms. I don’t really know what to do at this point. I don’t know if I should just ignore it since I’m only going to be here for a few months or if I should really push for him to get help.",2.1304022988505764,3.19855900383142,4.057354406130268,89.21683620689659,75.8199233716475,7.365593869731801,23.77796934865901,7.908726449838941,1.0175730268199228,944,28,217,14,20,322,133,261,0.10099999999999999,0.772,0.127,0.8036,0,0,5,0,1,0,12.0,0,1,0,0,15,6,0,0,11,0,25,7,0,1,1,33,41,21,0,7,10,9,0,2,1,3,5,0,0,2,12,9,5,2,4,2,0,4,8,2,0,1,4,0,36,4,31,32,3,36,0,0,0,0,29,17,0,4,16,147,48,2,0.0,0.11826591100342505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3200195828664674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15964600684431354,0.08305509983956072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09899087917761393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875612684999836,0.07675251992198309,0.0,0.12169409523383293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025387643104298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10290615067011824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09778190539771914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07711777203491392,0.0,0.26074930321578826,0.0,0.056727864026335124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3345235761484411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09829888053726554,0.23034905669373745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10971277966237436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.070503155478082,0.09753033656319192,0.10004208556788426,0.2644186805961982,0.08833422290790924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486018965992821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35071068813348016,0.07967236283671769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10474034295201756,0.0,0.0,0.07591474114303433,0.10621150675820072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952858863991434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09435860122495472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1918344994861241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130723310799798,0.08524251541117121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08256901729439732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684341077434184,0.09872080420191284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1594267411383243,0.08345083812476073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189737425784213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10391221609894674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08235884371627487,0.058874198864268375,0.0792294776620637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09253064563610236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202736454418719,0.0,0.07090658623870405,0.0,0.0,0.06427837980122447

You're exposed at a young age. You suppress and deny and rage. Then, all of the sudden, you're going from ""wine tasting"" to trying to convince yourself that you're not (nor will you ever be) of the same caliber of alcoholic as you have come to know. Yet you're drunk writing this. How do you find meaning? Purpose? How do you just stop???",1.5382258064516137,4.217007473118283,2.91206989247312,87.98810483870967,87.1720430107527,5.680645161290323,23.87903225806452,7.1686216300943375,1.299832258064516,377,15,70,6,12,122,65,93,0.135,0.797,0.068,-0.7476,3,0,3,0,0,0,26.0,0,6,0,0,6,4,1,0,5,0,6,5,0,2,3,17,12,7,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,3,3,5,2,3,2,0,3,2,1,0,0,0,1,7,3,13,10,2,14,0,0,0,0,9,3,0,0,8,47,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5484298508539104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22102815393861205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.232098863349923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2418886718724569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345171143374344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14582507918057067,0.0,0.0,0.2828895748926992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410142533654977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2601403258872366,0.0,0.2794999476256739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28491101076645625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2145193598612989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24183149454475586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17420665486551895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,yordanimustov,2020/04/17,"Resources for alcoholics to ease talking Hello, 

I am looking for resources for alcoholics who are facing a conversation about their alcoholism. Looking through Google and this subreddit I found nothing. Most of the advice is for the people doing the intervention and not the alcoholic. What sort of resources are their for those with a drinking problem to talk openly and freely without feeling defensive or combative?",9.335588235294123,11.941726088235296,7.934588235294116,62.398647058823535,60.17647058823529,10.734117647058824,44.48235294117647,10.793553405168565,5.9456847058823525,346,21,42,9,5,105,49,68,0.07400000000000001,0.848,0.078,0.3085,0,0,5,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,2,0,1,2,1,0,6,0,5,6,1,0,0,14,9,4,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,5,5,1,2,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,3,4,0,13,8,1,1,0,0,2,0,7,1,0,3,0,38,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17753226976770234,0.0,0.7766281312315634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17797390188691797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09186114715858827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19919901336764728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3051251732566697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17432359645864812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12595167843783145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1738399691558971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29204953676541345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17512975816403673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,agpo12,2020/04/17,"My roommate is an alcoholic My mom is an alcoholic and so i am very aware that i cannot change anyone’s behavior and that it has to be from that person, but I’m wondering what I can do to support my roommate/one of my closest friends. Her drinking has become worse in quarantine, going from like ~5 drinks most nights to 8+ every single night (we also live at a high elevation). It’s REALLY hard to watch. She has a fucked up family, her dad died 5 years ago, and she has never had proper support in her life until now (im considering my other roommate and i support in a friend aspect, not professional). Last night was an awful night where she accidentally broke a body-length mirror and had an intense emotional breakdown, which my other roommate and I talked her through and got her into bed. But my roommate and i have decided that something has to happen/change. She has gotten herself in very bad situations before where she ended up in the hospital, she skips out on her responsibilities often, etc. My other roommate and I are going to remove our alcohol from the house and not drink in front of her and refuse her offers if she offers us anything. What else can we do to support her not drinking? 

TL;DR roommate is an alcoholic and it’s time to step in, how can my other roommate and i support her in 1) understanding she has a problem 2) make it easier not to drink (if that’s possible)",3.6693670076726335,5.649076397058827,5.2471739130434765,78.50652173913045,73.63235294117645,7.818670076726343,27.26726342710997,8.587818076936951,2.182542327365729,1108,42,201,21,23,374,143,272,0.134,0.746,0.12,-0.7979999999999999,0,1,10,0,0,0,32.0,4,0,0,0,7,12,1,0,12,1,23,11,0,2,1,35,37,21,1,3,8,2,1,1,2,0,5,0,1,1,16,17,9,1,3,5,0,5,6,4,0,0,5,2,40,8,30,31,3,35,0,1,1,1,32,18,1,5,13,153,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658346602736096,0.3693175657110181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06908960940973295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060409007300101326,0.0,0.07109526999373282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07213575596366742,0.0,0.09541588091900052,0.07351531258953761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827877424531948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966379782337276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42316834506584494,0.0,0.0,0.07217147599302642,0.09718212640951432,0.07651983831481746,0.0,0.0963526476385641,0.0,0.0,0.07279104918944806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08144499732273283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13349627350559215,0.07987027567900443,0.0,0.0,0.09819991231099273,0.0,0.06909753290627461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639832566092614,0.0,0.07739245643360956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128047843302196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09968759425590118,0.0,0.0,0.09332082995485558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07042300660171877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06102295410225427,0.042207963681308566,0.0,0.07628788101934281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057668965369300274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10118413414745496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06663272488413514,0.0,0.0,0.32430135032762725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754363002132029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09739675990169412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0826678195781084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05534649609174788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711098012120704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665106674580135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4901969828054895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06944058529929376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05037729780111641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993966795771081,0.10392188431488786,0.0,0.0,0.14256893626769335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09369109427172,0.0,0.0,0.08804332410673582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055635192407761117
alcoholism,campson99,2020/04/17,"Alcohol Mom Relapsed Hi everyone, I see that this is a common type of post, though I am asking for some advice. To make a long story short, my mom was a lifelong functioning alcoholic. She was a good mom but that doesn’t mean she wasn’t tipsy half of the time. Two years ago when turned jaundiced and was hospitalized. The doctor said if she didn’t stop she would die. She made it through and appeared to be fine for two years though she’s been drinking since Easter, coming home drunk everyday after work. Two days ago i went to her privately and told her if i catch her drinking again i will tell my dad (he’s not a dumb man but genuinely has no idea when she’s tipsy and when she’s not). She swore it was just for the holiday and due to stress and i left it at that. I guess I just need advice on what to do? I want so badly to text her from a room away and tell her how much I refuse to go through this again. I want to tell her that if she wants to drink her life away and be dead by 60, that’s up to her but I’m done caring because I literally cannot go through all of this again. I have a lot more worse things to say but I’m keeping it brief on here. Any advice on what to do? Do I call her out in person? I’m just so completely overwhelmed but emotionally, I can’t handle a round 2. To note, I am 20f. Thanks for any advice :)",0.9690409356725168,2.7699646877193014,2.52105263157895,95.78847953216378,81.0701754385965,5.906432748538013,18.976608187134506,6.937597516519254,-0.037163742690058836,1036,24,247,12,27,338,152,285,0.126,0.778,0.096,-0.9281,0,0,5,0,0,1,27.0,0,0,0,1,15,8,1,2,11,0,23,8,0,3,1,41,47,24,2,8,13,4,1,0,0,2,4,2,2,2,15,10,6,3,2,5,0,7,8,4,0,4,12,4,37,4,35,31,5,38,0,1,2,0,36,12,1,7,18,164,52,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3703565046204736,0.16798126463234442,0.20251901277526185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12886722580539411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08857895979952905,0.0,0.17804249317146698,0.0,0.07911273895371773,0.057759046665008675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09675088993245626,0.0,0.09660448517726322,0.0,0.0,0.08161919607674678,0.09934413319442204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06110625652885066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983360961015258,0.0,0.0,0.09698118744888576,0.0,0.0969626939405634,0.0,0.2784583570472274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658159874938426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09053819659307967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10769782508206442,0.07947225331034775,0.0,0.0,0.10437839652109024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09504251204480696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069618208877948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08421862899081402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10294673346334593,0.0,0.06692510494390469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838512418084315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08055351650630621,0.0,0.08965524714513219,0.06324671783145043,0.0,0.0,0.1032111096355456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33291204413650616,0.0,0.0,0.06965254532713329,0.07025632108838163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273251242292777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09074482101850226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012945639499798,0.07534942840306075,0.0,0.0,0.0755039089648575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07837862163858078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792156898692664,0.10853641766064012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24844843154482496,0.08723356244937654,0.0,0.0,0.06294804522827026,0.0,0.1861838390342235,0.0,0.055249798895027714,0.0,0.0,0.09053819659307967,0.0,0.0,0.1030613737284146,0.27767251457521624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16765896125192828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783469516692155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06897951791960273,0.0,0.09655888988232117,0.06730806150534008,0.0,0.0,0.12203247598353142
alcoholism,TiredRocketScientist,2020/04/17,"Need Advice for my Alcoholic Mother My mom has been a functioning alcoholic as long as i can remember. Practically drinking herself to sleep every day after work then waking up to go to work. A cycle that resulted in my parents divorce and verbal/ mental abuse to me as i grew up. I lived with her half the time and my dad the other half because my school was close to her house, but it’s just been getting worse over the years, especially after i went to college.

She’s definitely on a lot of prescription medication that shouldnt be mixed with alcohol. She has had several life threatening situations as a result. I have talked it out with her countless times. She has gone to rehab, alcohol classes, and AA meetings. Shes lied about quitting countless times. 

Visited her alone today to talk it out (she doesnt really have close friends or local family) she told me she gives up on trying anymore because of X reasons. And she will buy more alcohol if i throw out what she has. She was also drunk - shes always drunk when i come over.

I cant let her drink herself to death. I dont want her to continue harassing my Father and I (through nasty phone calls and texts). She lives alone and wont do anymore self help “because theyre all religion based.” I gave her an ultimatum that i wouldnt talk to her unless she quits drinking and she threatened to kill herself. (Not the first time)

TDLR: Verbally abusive mom got help before and now gave up. She lives alone and i dont know how to help.",3.3751317540590904,5.565406211072665,4.464723183391005,82.8504624700559,75.12456747404845,7.767953154112322,27.378360393931327,8.617729084823388,2.176502688315145,1181,47,223,24,26,385,165,289,0.188,0.753,0.059000000000000004,-0.9917,1,3,8,0,2,0,31.0,0,0,0,5,6,3,2,0,9,0,25,15,2,4,1,37,38,22,2,5,6,6,0,0,1,4,8,0,0,1,8,19,10,0,3,5,1,7,8,2,1,3,11,0,47,1,40,21,3,37,0,0,0,0,49,15,0,3,15,153,55,5,0.0,0.20545802180807124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08472527839205066,0.0,0.4632962975674112,0.0,0.26939482979938706,0.0,0.06933644800410943,0.07214393551500148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17197238020925007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15856023849346307,0.0,0.07377796303118556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0885335721872223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07468705448361618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055916335004925766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2032308050082052,0.2548081270568852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305111203274127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817359783954281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07374962347975451,0.0,0.0,0.06698660989505396,0.0,0.04529879791396296,0.08317352629849803,0.04927537709454806,0.0,0.06934439980917341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17434580671761765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004375122151624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09592414821002417,0.0,0.0476497633283428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08865980718292553,0.061240972706556575,0.0,0.0,0.2296813113071178,0.07672952646551986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07371188599427292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734426454477985,0.08737634494151758,0.0,0.0,0.2030912756952859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428925955129962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09627354617460414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1844388659807885,0.0,0.0,0.05554423423813008,0.08914524037091495,0.0,0.0,0.09821772507314952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08774817904088247,0.0,0.0,0.09045025592658072,0.09794983843650594,0.0,0.0,0.09745793153743933,0.08676572877982819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20906603350841046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20222912935342624,0.0,0.0821844130326874,0.08284853988805936,0.0,0.05886572226886165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0511397423465383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08037465423348683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12624179753671233,0.0,0.08835787922656373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05583396198844228

alcoholism,ekulinm,2020/04/18,"What does it take to make someone stop Gonna keep this short because I could spend hours typing every little detail. My mum's been an alcoholic as long as long as I can remember. In the past few years it's taken a toll on her, nearly killed her, she can't walk anymore. She's extremely weak, been in hospital for 8 of the last 12 months, immune system is fucked and the rest of it.  Alcoholism even killed my dad a couple months ago. 

To my knowledge she hasn't drank since last year which was the last time she went into hospital before coming back out a couple months ago. She's been living with her mum since and they haven't been getting on locked in the same house together due to covid and she says she's going mad. Anyway I went to see her earlier to take her to the shop in her wheelchair and she bought some gin. I wasn't happy with that and she swore she wasn't going to drink it but I know it's a lie. 

Anyway what does it fucking take for somebody to stop drinking. If her husband dying and coming extremely close to death herself due to that drug what else does it take. I don't even know what to say to her.",3.833555194805197,4.676562471861473,4.394737554112556,89.26924918831169,71.46753246753245,7.3334415584415575,23.095508658008658,7.413659706084162,0.7261794372294372,885,20,190,9,16,281,125,231,0.11,0.883,0.006999999999999999,-0.968,0,0,5,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,0,5,7,5,0,11,0,14,10,0,1,0,26,36,11,4,2,2,4,0,0,0,1,5,2,0,0,15,13,5,3,4,3,3,7,6,6,0,0,12,3,29,1,30,22,4,40,0,0,1,2,26,12,2,2,20,116,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18317990456180933,0.22084256546894268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10246904042462472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07944931019822743,0.0,0.06298498037167513,0.0,0.08792059593628146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17800790558962487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08249532051536479,0.2286507346374037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072333675918166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2712569882397892,0.0,0.0,0.2024351758512632,0.11982233099406905,0.0,0.08631343532926714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13648825107961468,0.0,0.08705441353825172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19104162079812828,0.05398220747988585,0.0,0.11744212881850395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10998967141374656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10175272759620327,0.11922132118745013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918385776808426,0.2286240478539812,0.0,0.11356766752369768,0.2526670630900221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10355718219075616,0.09123644756005983,0.18287589994604875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896916606485652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2474152357085201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0986338683568137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170452607411652,0.0,0.0,0.16433381584391185,0.0,0.0,0.08233536560459402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1709403541265745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08754557421846408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1727659634163285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3107453262495869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060248700417877575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19156363792244366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13307375291542115
alcoholism,n0morethrowaways,2020/04/18,"When is it a problem? Okay. Looking for some perspective. My husband of 17 years has always been a drinker. At one time I was as well. I’ve slowed in my need to party but he is a few years younger than I, and no where near ready to slow down. During this quarantine I’ve begged him not to get wasted. Drink, feel free, but just don’t get wasted. Two or three times a week he’s stupid drunk. I get mad, I yell, he apologizes and says it will stop. Of course, nothing changes. 

I can’t get any mental clarity about if this is a ‘me’ problem or a ‘him’ problem. We’ve had a long successful marriage that I’m not willing to give up on yet. I figure that much more of my nagging and he’ll divorce me and take the matter out of my hands. 

He’s mostly a sweet happy drunk, only occasionally getting mean and defensive. He’s just annoying and kind of stupid and not a great partner in that state. His way of escaping the stress and boredom is to get drunk, which makes me miserable. I’ve tried to get my head right about it, tried to accept it but I still get so angry. Help. Maybe this should be posted to AITA?",1.0187261380323065,3.191698352422911,2.4978689427312797,94.00043043318651,83.09691629955947,5.545447870778268,20.912077826725408,6.816661863887847,0.3218077826725403,854,26,189,10,24,277,139,227,0.23399999999999999,0.585,0.18100000000000002,-0.9638,1,1,2,0,1,0,29.0,0,0,0,1,10,20,6,2,11,1,14,6,2,1,0,35,31,17,0,6,11,1,2,0,1,4,0,2,0,1,11,9,4,2,4,4,1,0,6,11,1,3,3,6,18,10,27,23,5,25,0,1,1,0,17,10,0,5,12,115,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105605753895626,0.0,0.0,0.0903578655419343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14056150096868766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301644780915693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06718433517509677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5553632333552808,0.12746342238050928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14649241516515493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414452613270391,0.0,0.0,0.13636553252573894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906164493641146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13836627578997165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11758799315338925,0.1115794465044356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08869343450309061,0.0,0.1334882990450616,0.14473712006442688,0.0,0.0,0.13390424161379882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09767658589666256,0.09852328510526884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12749476025143638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003785388468494,0.10105553394718507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12725513853458786,0.0,0.0,0.3814231516541546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11347240048736533,0.0,0.10566555581148213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10611216088346834,0.11108737088556356,0.15220501523317248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09990359392971948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15495806225594588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804234293099861,0.0,0.12979713851406055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1054680164740452,0.10658231554702348,0.0,0.11946834694327578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17113108453689874
alcoholism,HardlyBoi,2020/04/18,"Made a plan to quit drinking. Terrified of the withdrawls. Long time lurker first time posting. So im not sure what to put here.. Ive messed up my life alot with alcohol in the past and paid the price but never really learned anything except how to better hide my drinking.

With everything going on and where I am in life I need to change cause the world is going to be so different I can't see a way forward if I dont stop drinking. Ive never really made any significant changes to better improve my future only reactive to stay where I am in life.

Been unemployed for 2 months and lost my last job due to drinking. Before that I was a chef for 12 years and able to maintain jobs while drinking for years on end. Left my last kitchen job of 8 years in July of last year in an attempt to remove myself from the culture and quit drinking after I got my second OWI.

I didnt stick with it tho and kept up with my drinking. Now I'm almost flat broke. Up to my eyes in debt and fines and unemployed with no prospects for the future because of my drinking fucking up my life. Been going to bed blacking out nightly and waking up everyday for the past month in quarantine and slamming a coffee cup full of rum to stave off the shakes so I can hold my fork steady while I try to eat breakfast.

I WILL WAKE UP MONDAY and break that cycle. Must make it happen for myself this time and move forward in life before I'm homeless. I'm terrified I'll have such bad withdrawl I may have to go to the hospital.

alcoholism,Mavattack28,2020/04/18,"Self Harm while drunk So I didnt know where to post this, I assumed people here would have the best answer. I am not a cutter or a drinker. Due to this quarantine I've been drinking more than usual. And by usual, maybe I'll get tipsy once every 3 months. Now I'm drinking like every other day. I have only cut myself once when I was in college and going through some severe depression a couple years ago. Anyways I've gone through a lot of therapy and such since that time and have never felt better. Even In this quarantine I've been quite positive, every time I drink or do get drunk the most harm I do is smoke a few more cigs than normal or send snaps to my friends about my love for henry cavills abs, no homo lmao. 
Last night while drunk, I was trying to work on a screenplay, I'm an independent Filmaker, and I could not put the words together or think of any transitions. I went for a sit down pee and saw the new box of razors just sitting there, and next thing I knew I had purposely cut myself 3 times over the healed scar. They were very light but still, I havent been suicidal or even depressed enough to think about suicide for at least 5 or 6 months. I still dont feel that way either now. I'm wondering if alchohol can make a person react to repressed emotions that I'm not realizing I still have. Does anyone have any personal experience with this?

TL;DR- I cut my arm on purpose while drunk. I have a history of semi-psychotic depression and suicidal thoughts but have gone through therapy. Is the alchohol retrieving repressed emotions.

Also I'm not gonna cry or kill myself over jokes, this is reddit and I never take myself too seriously.",5.339750982961991,5.998311406727829,5.855334207077327,80.81715596330275,67.96024464831804,8.919702927042376,29.332896461336823,8.976282227363876,2.2752401048492787,1318,45,254,22,21,426,187,327,0.165,0.748,0.08800000000000001,-0.9723,0,2,5,0,0,4,31.0,0,0,1,4,19,18,4,2,16,0,26,12,2,3,2,51,50,25,4,4,16,0,2,1,1,2,1,0,0,3,10,10,7,2,11,8,0,6,10,12,0,0,15,4,26,6,30,32,10,45,0,3,1,2,7,9,1,13,27,164,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369056047316861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07550125940117502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12840682415245006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06601508054972308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990795916974695,0.08349976061423853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753803167095216,0.10446510593059698,0.103707172257778,0.06088794328950466,0.0,0.24395080705821895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262059615602861,0.0,0.11065018593341196,0.2774635138118012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2124016331222413,0.0,0.09755285602739663,0.0,0.12471649942367112,0.0,0.2386385999525708,0.0,0.0,0.0923530731729502,0.0,0.0,0.047737554782235486,0.0,0.09065034632332823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07294249353229106,0.0,0.09865276893505764,0.0,0.053656527485885834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10445291337122647,0.0,0.05188637787220631,0.07695839844331206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046124944719240536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802657243860198,0.08521053540234362,0.0,0.06302075740395692,0.0,0.09484956533160904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15071754947195715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14563274243595595,0.09118371858390807,0.1004082558368966,0.08859928643549472,0.09250373539902172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010914430258293,0.0,0.07180459664115232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545340805466257,0.1648738708851231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09042061860526708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949101582794196,0.0,0.1004188061612901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09849232881399823,0.1066587108653087,0.0,0.0780985997266295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2261926867342254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3098142831520015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.070986090369619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21593674911378172,0.0,0.06272315186309096,0.12099082224190605,0.0,0.07495259906420819,0.16515722675412228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06409956516081464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20796300627808686,0.07789980527940514,0.0,0.07493986806718736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875208897087226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10238580985800967,0.06873307601887126,0.0,0.0,0.06706759118730657,0.0,0.0,0.06079824636005121

alcoholism,noahr1999,2020/04/18,"Confused So... I’m not the stereotypical drinker or alcoholic, I go through phases, I’ll go a week having 5-7 beers a night (doesn’t take much for me to feel good) than I’ll go a week maybe having 2-3 beers in total, I never considered it a huge problem because I could go without drinking fairly easily. However with this covid shit and less structure in my day I’ve been drinking a lot more. Yesterday was my first day not drinking since this quarantine all started and it was tough, I couldn’t sleep, felt like my heart was beating faster than usual, I ready some withdrawal symptoms and now my anxiety is at an all time high.  even without drinking I struggle with anxiety, so I’m wondering if maybe I’m just overthinking everything and I just need to tough it out, or if I should seek actual help. Please I know my problems might not seem as serious as some but I’m young and don’t want this to get worse.

alcoholism,CA-to-DE,2020/04/18,"Thought that maybe my letter to my sober self would resonate with others here. Yes, I def have an issue being able to write this coherently yet still be blackout (aka Keeevin). Hello Kevin -- Keeevin here.

We'll see if you ever actually find this letter since this was a throwaway account for some.stupid shit and you're Keeevin right now (for redditors, that's blackout Kevin).

But hopefully, something clicks in you that'll make you stop drinking to oblivion before you f up our life again (pls remember the.first time... you're on track there not gonna lie). For all the redditors out there, I had 6 years clean and sober since I was 20. Now 27 and covid fucked stuff up...

Some notes to self... maybe might enlighten others in the process, or just show them how crazy I am. Again, hopefully Kevin sees them:

(1) You hate this. KEEEEVIN hates this too. I dont feel good right now. In fact, I wish I was sober. Just like wtf dude. You do this alone. Theres literally nothing fun about it... just stop! 

(2) Dont need to say this but yeah, you're gonna be puking tomorrow morning... and maybe afternoon. Isn't it crazy that i can predict this though and still go through with it? Something is seriously f'd up with me. Kevin cannot drink. But that's cool. He was sober  and happy before. 

(3) You've gained 40 lbs since starting drinking again. I hope this isn't our nudie account on reddit. Cause none of those are accurate depictions of ourselves anymore...

(4) Not to cause alarm with redditors but I just dont really feel like trying anymore when I get like this... it was three days ago that we adamantly sweared that we'd stop. I'm getting seriously discoraged in myself.

(5) FUCK no Kev! You can do it! You did it before!!! Dont give up. Just dont get to.this level again. You, Kevin, and Keeevin hate it!!!

(6) Alright, whatever. I'll continue AA. My way hasn't worked so far. Kev - look. You dont need to completely deny AA becuase of religion. Just choose whatever spirituality you want to and get over the fact that the group uses the word ""God."" Its an f'ng metaphor!!! You're a pompous asss shit sometimes, Kevin. Just stop being stubborn and go with the flow or else yah.  KEEEVIN IS GONNA BE WRITING THIS MESSAGE A WHOLE LOT MORE!!

So there my unsent letter. To myself. When I'm sober.  I feel absolutely insane sometimes but am hopeful I can get over this like I did from when I was 20 to 26... 

Hoping that maybe sharing it with the world will help.

alcoholism,Poordrunkstudent99,2020/04/18,"Possibly a problem I’m not sure if this is a problem yet to be honest. I’ve been drinking consistently since I turned 18 (I’m 20 now) but since quarantine I’ve been drinking most days. Right now it’s 4 am and I’ve had a few beers and a few shots (I genuinely don’t know how many I’ve had as I haven’t counted). Whenever I drink I tend to drink a lot and I’m worried that it’s going to become a problem. Ideally I’d like to stop it before that but I’ve felt pretty dependant on alcohol lately, I’m not sure if it’s just because I’ve been living in my parents house since lockdown or not. If after lockdown this keeps up it could become something more. What are some steps I should take to stop this before it becomes a bigger problem or am I already past the point of no return.",0.5540984697272151,2.663491359281437,2.9373153692614764,90.52823519627412,84.50898203592814,5.62727877578177,23.050232867598144,6.937597516519254,0.8048073186959419,615,23,132,8,18,211,95,167,0.16,0.758,0.083,-0.8599,1,3,7,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,5,9,0,0,8,0,14,6,0,2,2,33,25,12,0,10,11,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,12,3,6,3,2,5,0,2,6,4,0,0,6,1,8,5,11,16,6,18,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,9,11,78,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12153236564288787,0.0,0.0,0.12549312673294574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.069322810557705,0.37678525381789935,0.19353511838045426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09079636831252524,0.0,0.0,0.0733401551761814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4456102157352976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918927634846648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06462984031697817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13121790328974425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10107978576621417,0.0,0.0,0.062497676864929186,0.0,0.12828139839743347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555797125742281,0.0,0.10041706662193886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09668089220569878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11529448717994498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262728827843374,0.0,0.10855884895612232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10750239647435264,0.12820249818355298,0.0,0.11569438020646715,0.0,0.43525969447024215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711647448393214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2822117046601305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087547406428913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901504466946777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21435998476901472,0.0,0.08550347740117678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12369497938960915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154884367709432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,KachiunGhengis,2020/04/18,"I'm afraid I'm have alcohol problems Don't know where to start, i have some emotional (depression/anxiety) problems, which ive had for years, alcohol has always made me feel better. Lately, at least the last year or so, i find i get drunker and drunker... i can go several weeks without booze, it's not an everyday thing, but i always want it, and when i start, even if i say to myself or out loud ""just one or two"" i get wrecked, to the point i either pass out or the booze runs out, usually the former. I find myself, when i drink, up until 8 or 9am, having started at 7pm the previous day. I avoid spirits on purpose because ive known for years they get me drunk too quick, and so stupid too quick, but i find that means i just keep drinking beer upon beer upon beer. Even though i don't need it everyday, from articles ive read recently and a friend or two, apparently this kind of 'alcohol abuse' can still be considered alcoholism. I can't stand the idea of never drinking again, i wish more than anything i could stop when everyone else does, but it never seems to happen, and i get blackout drunk i do stupid things, mostly just silly facebook texts, but at worst attempts on my life, even if more 'cries for help'. Though i must say that latter is very rare. I don't know how to solve this. I don't want to give up alcohol, as want to enjoy it as i used to, and as everyone else does.. but i'm worried i'm becoming/ have become alcohol dependent/alcoholic. To add to this, i am writing this at 04:13 am while i should be in bed as i am meant to be caring for my dad tomorrow (who has Parkinsons).. just can't seem to stop. Am i being an idiot,should i just shake myself and say stop being a tit, or do you think i have a bigger problem? I just don't trust my own judgement anymore, as i am very good at making excuses.",4.533762676302602,4.664616573726544,5.6666860939503465,83.3201923301084,69.58981233243968,9.167921669192213,28.817927497377315,9.085049710711278,2.137727450751836,1414,47,300,25,23,472,189,373,0.16699999999999998,0.759,0.073,-0.991,1,1,13,0,1,0,59.0,0,1,1,2,24,17,2,3,11,0,36,18,1,4,3,72,68,36,0,13,23,1,1,0,1,2,7,4,1,0,15,11,16,5,13,9,0,4,11,9,0,3,3,5,45,8,42,57,8,53,1,0,0,1,12,18,1,13,30,206,60,1,0.0,0.08786676425171701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5547769289155084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12341312582108555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056731739234856166,0.0,0.07354619915385173,0.0,0.0,0.061026868719889424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045206882887950384,0.1638064653007084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06558796420849015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075610452388318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05921024776597609,0.0,0.08146062039185041,0.04782667897277335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979478416951726,0.0,0.0,0.21794394234403505,0.0,0.0,0.1239013282074976,0.0834193452087028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469447560131042,0.0,0.0,0.14172497250544658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03749722168573731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20334104863341068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05729536970981601,0.0,0.1549809060620866,0.0711404554851702,0.042146496928951005,0.06220138758659475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06557891391283402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04970748367418423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08371693768425423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591628355386221,0.0,0.07722560480213847,0.08151213535838943,0.06044981022115601,0.08365503515221681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05238097849865946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07017141888589427,0.04950197642001182,0.0,0.0,0.0807813289074967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05498825661028125,0.11439260458005385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050252329779301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07010460494161128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2128815956334696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07417947017951815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0732234624154681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17692359805973562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13502386795448024,0.0,0.08377901516480127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574712184300006,0.0,0.05922379390716809,0.18600174110790535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09853642236043958,0.04751835011491485,0.1457224710730582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14488591914622811,0.0,0.0,0.06404991239564434,0.08167610369251334,0.12237854582885432,0.13122340938883628,0.0,0.059486198731149215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08527965195300799,0.0714870167505033,0.0,0.0,0.07531247209993865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14326866964174365

alcoholism,grass_isgreener,2020/04/19,"How to help an alcoholic in denial with memory problems?  

For a few years my sister (23) has suspected that my mom (62) might have developed a drinking problem. Until about a year ago I (23) didn’t necessarily think she was right, but then began to notice some worrisome behavior. Before I go into the details about what’s happened, I think it’s also important to note my mom has a memory impairment- it's probably early onset Alzheimer’s that hasn’t been diagnosed, but from an MRI looks very likely. 

About a year ago I would notice sometimes we talked on the phone in the early or late evening she would be slurring her words, and she would be a little more forgetful than normal. I don’t live in the same state and try to see her every few months, but because of this I couldn’t really observe her behavior. 

Last June I visited her to take her to see a neurologist, and I ended up taking her to the emergency room. She had gone on a date, got drunk and wandered out of the restaurant before dinner had been served, and a group of very sweet teenagers called me from her phone, saying she had fallen and hit her head on the sidewalk. Once things calmed down I called her date to try to figure out what happened, and he said she had about 6 glasses of wine and then disappeared. When I picked her up she had claimed to only have 2 glasses, but was very inebriated. At that time I was concerned, but thought with her memory condition she had forgotten how many glasses she had. 

About a month ago I got a call from her around 11:30 am on a Saturday- she was slurring her words and not making much sense- she kept calling me her dog’s name. I called her boyfriend, who she’s been dating for about 9 months, to see if he could go check on her. It turns out she hadn’t eaten enough and had likely also mixed up medications on top of drinking. He took her out to eat, and again she wandered out of the restaurant. This time he had to call the police to find her. 

With the coronavirus he has been living with her, and today he realized she was sneaking around and had likely been drinking vodka and wine without him knowing and fell and hurt her wrist. When he suggested that maybe they shouldn’t keep alcohol in the house she got mad and told him to leave. She did forget that she said that so he is still with her, but I am concerned because this is such a huge burden for him. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? I am in the middle of moving and we are also in the middle of a pandemic so I don’t know if I should go down to visit or not, and even if I go I don’t know what to do. Any suggestions would be wonderful.",5.927608142493639,5.755365603053438,6.219709923664122,81.58037913486005,66.63358778625954,9.505750636132317,29.48956743002545,9.120678840339163,2.1961709414758266,2072,63,421,33,30,666,231,524,0.083,0.875,0.043,-0.9552,0,0,8,0,0,0,50.0,2,0,1,1,22,10,1,0,29,0,54,16,2,4,0,84,88,42,0,14,14,3,0,3,0,7,5,3,1,0,18,34,11,2,11,7,1,12,11,5,0,0,35,8,70,5,72,40,7,77,0,1,4,0,78,34,0,8,33,298,88,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19309488580812945,0.1551974093912718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17420013655081065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09875546659232108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05077105617126325,0.0,0.0,0.12927774929266872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08852555904236467,0.0,0.12357263367660505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4448615643948508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05797369725216201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07369828335391382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06354207089365706,0.0,0.0,0.21339238743493627,0.0,0.0742988242814066,0.0,0.0,0.06431148570274656,0.07502621358317631,0.0,0.09591730169825702,0.0,0.061177605995132035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06636482048965221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1650652274150572,0.0,0.17422011457921913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284187195545866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07451947714191988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04866938947939794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0837829435335874,0.07773120475223855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06453968376965931,0.0,0.0,0.11971474624600276,0.059187372607579815,0.08190797817131272,0.07688419633433788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10642169060778932,0.07277494882265123,0.12823307203769274,0.0,0.06097466023333965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048468174051561806,0.0736158044516341,0.07294715948492812,0.0,0.0,0.07314759287798625,0.0,0.07702842722267228,0.0,0.17008143613154378,0.17387138907917268,0.07717363192032717,0.0533771839203814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07114302227440218,0.0,0.16533541716051053,0.0,0.07732797464160324,0.0,0.05522367281937881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07828656383047733,0.13895717539291388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046516242983387336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062009100083710286,0.13813871547823314,0.05774290486121012,0.0,0.0,0.1735838661715769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07181379149328262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057986960494895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918834761762368,0.05836169164776073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048239290779643305,0.0930519478443158,0.0,0.057644747012083275,0.08467971021972573,0.0,0.06882640797037394,0.06938258966231754,0.08067310608202767,0.09859573286082796,0.0789795387196823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797341769472887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06999407742616111,0.07874315474819328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20632209556283546,0.0,0.0,0.14027663779348715
alcoholism,wastedpuntential,2020/04/19,"Confronting friends about their actions while drunk Might be an odd question, but do you think it's fair to confront your friends (while sober) about things they have done while drunk that you dislike, in order to give them a chance to try and change that behavior? Or should you just stay quiet and pretend everything is fine, so they never know there's an issue? Especially considering they might not remember having done anything.

In my case, I was never confronted, and found out how people felt through another source. As a result, gossip and false rumors spread, and some friends cut me off without even talking to me. If I had been confronted about it, I would have taken responsibility and cut down on drinking sooner. But now, it just feels like I had a bunch of fake friends who were too afraid of confrontation to say anything...

Don't get me wrong, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It just would have been nice for people to be straight with me, yknow? Because now that I'm aware of it, I am going to work on this.

alcoholism,MaiaPapaya33,2020/04/19,"Recovery / Recovered ? TLDR; is saying you’re “recovered” and still drinking recreationally a thing? My boyfriend says he’s in total control and doesn’t need recovery. 


My boyfriend of 2 months identifies as a recovered alcoholic, as in he doesn’t need recovery, because he is fully in control. He did identify himself as an alcoholic who used to spend days at a time drunk and could get aggressive back when he was in the military. He says he realized he hated how he felt and how he was living and decided to never get to that place again and since then he has control. 

He says he’s always had a high tolerance (he started drinking when he was 12) and so now he doesn’t drink to get drunk, but he drinks to relax like when he’s socially anxious or just for the taste. He says he needs about 6 drinks to start feeling it. So he does drink more than the average 25 year old maybe but it barely effects him. 

He feels incredibly invalidated if I don’t use the word ‘recovered’ to refer to him. He got really explosive the first time I told him that I was very open to accepting that was his reality and that he did feel in control, and that my prior understanding of that feeling of control was called recovery which is experienced in many ways. 

I know there’s a lot of different ways of experiencing alcoholism and I’ve heard that there are some people in AA for example who leave and say they are recovered. 

My question is, is Recovered a thing? How can I beat validate him in his experience? Or is it objectively invalid as some of my alcoholic friends would say? Very open to any and all answers.",4.450198154180239,6.209997465798048,5.695818403908795,77.00976452225844,71.08469055374594,10.06780673181325,31.35844191096633,10.317481424215053,3.5212910966340925,1270,57,239,38,24,424,155,307,0.036000000000000004,0.884,0.08,0.9456,1,0,10,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,1,8,16,6,2,0,12,0,25,13,0,11,3,56,46,30,0,6,6,0,5,1,1,1,4,8,0,0,15,14,13,5,14,9,1,0,5,2,1,1,13,16,18,4,33,31,6,34,0,0,0,0,47,13,0,7,20,144,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3284052730520371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06392358671505811,0.0,0.0,0.052242843644812284,0.0,0.0,0.08678906891238218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05907278869461005,0.0,0.046831098056697024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844572712181691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4308223289807851,0.061337582729660986,0.0,0.0,0.049545019466429904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08026455867260836,0.0,0.0,0.06722905757245495,0.0,0.0,0.4515486794377997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07514845404422046,0.0,0.0,0.15537776138832446,0.0,0.07376293122389102,0.0,0.0,0.06534631661077989,0.0,0.0,0.059353905990945775,0.0,0.12041185232841865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06144304053780957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584763427017738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08116860184108714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04222037176552351,0.0,0.0,0.08134535102615141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037532246296069084,0.0,0.06783685565696114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531287907499299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788731286401196,0.07717987021491353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06132005384888636,0.0,0.0,0.1708917053847099,0.05925127922807285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806136938994935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05325997563743329,0.0,0.08026455867260836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08606027953808963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04921531724734237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42765379133902576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06354947194322047,0.0,0.0,0.07831222729227995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10875261465061192,0.0,0.061351615563289996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10207668750697796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08959319445392874,0.0,0.0,0.07340846858360088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07997632378247962,0.0,0.13270225843077452,0.0,0.12677542253802826,0.0,0.1219583721048592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05457344970813677,0.0,0.0,0.0494720323383425
alcoholism,havenmarah,2020/04/19,"Substituting in quarantine. My drinking has been bad, but once the quarantine began it got so much worse. It was like there was nothing to do but drink. I drank as soon as I woke up. All-day until I fell asleep. Everyday. Then I picked up some coke. I’ve struggled with drug addiction as well. I haven’t had a drink since, but now I have a coke addiction to deal with.

alcoholism,outofideastoday,2020/04/19,"Still Standing (but a bit anxious) I haven’t been “all in” with aa since rehab almost 10 months ago. Due to other life events I have a really solid and supportive friend network. But I did decide that aa should be a part of my life.  Since quarantine I’ve managed well. I walk to work, so I have few easy opportunities to be where alcohol is or could be purchased. I have only had a few cravings. But I am watching (hearing) about ppl relapsing and my sponsor relapsed today. I still feel like I’m on track, but now I feel like I don’t have an anchor. I guess I’m just reaching out here into the void in hopes that someone will agree with me - if I keep focusing on doing the next right thing, if I stay sober today...I can keep on track.",3.9993999999999983,4.6093434733333325,5.1280000000000046,85.01400000000002,70.93333333333334,7.866666666666667,27.0,7.908726449838941,1.4763999999999995,571,18,120,7,10,189,99,150,0.0,0.828,0.172,0.9587,0,1,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,2,9,7,0,0,7,0,19,4,0,0,1,25,29,10,0,5,8,0,2,2,1,2,4,1,0,0,4,6,1,2,3,0,1,1,2,0,3,0,3,4,16,7,14,20,5,21,0,0,1,0,2,9,0,6,11,81,20,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442926571421117,0.1739599147505951,0.1629984070589909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18389252875229226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1777111478914045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299647909242755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16461064631546454,0.23257691943039044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12576168866403914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17931804734563345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834623586636779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1616750379358266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2893686932181928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.229949482592746,0.15904997639981144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12992764995419434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17311598765497213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237998166793391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1762724446010413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10427959713563514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390113121943648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2693028797972133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13792106241382746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734994270964041,0.2599890486291937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847182658115259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081423065574426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3085885546692453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14635674933241205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185041433136694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,I_SuckAtReddit,2020/04/19,"Am I becoming an alcoholic? I don't drink every night, but I will admit I would love to drink most nights, hardly a night I don't fancy one.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is I can't drink one can, never mind a 4 pack,, never mind an 8 pack unless im workign the next day)

&amp;#x200B;

If I drink I need A LOT of cans of lager. (oh yeah we're talking lager cans).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24, have a girlfriend who I live with so I pretty much can drink any night but I know inside not to on work nights (non-exsistant atm)

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I ask here is because although I only drink on weekends or the odd- weekday (4-8 cans) I need a full 18 can pack of carlsberg before I call it a night... this isn't normal right?

alcoholism,illsburydopeboy,2020/04/20,"Hit 2 years while in quarantine    It has been 2 years since my last drink, i posted on here last year after my 1 year mark. I may not post here often but this thread helps me get through tough times. I know a lot of people here are going through the struggle, just know you gotta keep trying. 
    Whether it’s your first day or 5th year, stay aware, stay alert and stay sober. Choose to love yourself, choose the harder path and I swear it will reward you continuously. I’m not saying it’s a cheat code and life is perfect, but if you can harness that energy into something positive, wewf, amazing things happen. Just imagine if you put the energy you put into the lying and sneaking, planning your ways to get drinks. 
      Idk about you guys but I spent the majority of my time worrying about drinking, and once you remove that you realize other areas you can direct that focus/time.
    Everyone is on their own path and finds sobriety on their time, so I don’t want anyone to feel berated or down talked, I just want anyone who’s reading to know you are worth it. You deserve the things you dream, you deserve happiness and love, you deserve sobriety.

alcoholism,slj06,2020/04/20,"Does cutting people off work? I’m asking this more on my Mom’s behalf but any perceptive is welcome.

A bit of background (feel free to skip) this is my understanding of the situation 
I am a 20 and my dad is an alcoholic. It probably started when I was about 14 due to work related stress. He lost said job when I was 18 and was on/ off benders for about 4 months until he got a job. He was ok for about a month then got into a car accident while drunk. Lost his job, went to jail for a bit but was able to do a home arrest while working program (with a different job). He just finished the program last Friday (it was a nine month program) and his alcohol detecting ankle monitor was taken off. The same day he started drinking again. He left Sunday afternoon and no one in my family knows where he is.

Now the question, should my family (especially my mom) cut him off? (By cut off I mean not let him back into the house, not answer his calls, even my mom getting a legal separation to protect herself) Does cutting people off actually work? We still love him and want to help him, but nothing we try seems to get through to him.

My dad is very manipulative and will no doubt come back to my mom at some point. He will not stop drinking when he gets back. However now that my mom, my sister, and I are working from home having him in the house would make work almost impossible. Plus I have no idea where he has been and could have possibly contacted the coronavirus and give it to us. (I am diabetic and my mom has a heart condition so this is very serious to us). 

This is not what we want at all but at this point he has broken our trust and hurt all of us. I don’t want him to die on the streets but he is unresponsive to help and we just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Thanks in advanced for any advice. Like I said all perspectives are welcome.",2.9826720285969586,4.534978549597857,4.475621983914209,85.11972430741734,74.49597855227881,7.976014298480786,26.10625558534406,8.648137234880735,1.7734511885612156,1441,51,303,28,30,481,185,373,0.133,0.74,0.127,-0.3394,6,0,4,0,0,0,42.0,8,0,0,9,19,18,4,2,20,1,36,8,1,2,3,58,65,26,1,6,11,9,1,1,0,4,3,2,2,0,11,21,5,2,10,3,1,4,9,10,0,2,16,3,40,9,47,43,8,53,0,3,0,1,52,23,0,5,27,205,51,14,0.06994526781465768,0.0,0.06825649166092314,0.0,0.0,0.06834970619237499,0.0,0.14950043915922387,0.07004008214337698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09513036127880352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06936691081801442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06538938348960016,0.0,0.0,0.16135078045725895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527242335761369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142193878852834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06025165484505542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055845604851762064,0.0,0.0,0.04510891131282108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259214505798513,0.07307791777493693,0.0,0.0,0.12241915043489784,0.0,0.0,0.13703946803359626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04619818972204973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13187634705247506,0.0,0.03536642902723865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10963054664607512,0.0670978743696816,0.0,0.0,0.1118832405863959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828854791337035,0.09376567726639523,0.0,0.14032161321329642,0.0,0.0,0.16141489605338996,0.07487785583802896,0.07895969359548885,0.0,0.0,0.2776395422966837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07688017992830834,0.05701472873948265,0.0,0.0,0.07599573813771711,0.07152377527736922,0.0,0.034171724782295944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15270704469834295,0.0,0.06312833504830953,0.0,0.046689009400189774,0.0,0.0,0.07619090180805825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4915143138193509,0.1674889363586405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06711437090246887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04739672366897105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09698248354427813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13224177278676413,0.07885277999141947,0.0,0.0,0.07541282885345113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07835470767895551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13306793399380273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06367554485792394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786214116155157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09901524113106486,0.0,0.0558583812287714,0.05847737583482252,0.08012206796129866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06439620516063674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04748824551818928,0.0,0.0,0.07281549054741536,0.25240663514207096,0.0,0.0,0.1154243424162572,0.1237665935294562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06483996401583958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30552592807913936,0.0,0.0,0.049687111427760035,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Frankie1142,2020/04/20,Forearm numbness. I haven’t drank in about two weeks. Before that I had a lot of side pains for years. Sometimes it was only slight. What really worries me is that I had huge hand and forearm numbness . It’s all going away and very minimum right now. Does anyone else have this problem? Needless to say I’m scared to go to the doctor. It’s only a matter of time before toxic thoughts come back in my head and I get drunk again. Until then I’m smoking weed which deters my alcohol cravings.,2.2114432989690727,4.607747927835057,3.2775360824742283,88.84104639175258,80.03092783505154,5.1171134020618565,23.1020618556701,6.2581,0.6226131958762884,387,13,73,3,10,124,73,97,0.183,0.752,0.065,-0.8983,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,1,3,0,6,11,4,0,1,9,14,5,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,8,4,3,0,1,1,0,3,1,5,0,1,5,2,7,0,11,9,2,17,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,1,8,45,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2077805932033779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359460858297082,0.1992108100910361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18266815712571285,0.14950038972363247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33088174898971884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16747943558690734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19900164810756915,0.17014213362762065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16241666778371705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101578742927399,0.0,0.22099177430908795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995355621783268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16529270229923734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2957370884549082,0.20688130721474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1860379270907421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12455327184377925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16603740552032129,0.0,0.15461411466090114,0.19465277745917325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19229073803724372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15435128429280234,0.11337045180558455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18992442241702656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16042052098467058,0.0,0.0,0.15595555458215962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1974474517422648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12520296194645691
alcoholism,lordsparky,2020/04/20,"Help with craving moods Hi all, I’m 32 female in UK and I’ve struggled with alcohol for a very long time and I’m trying to space out my drinking for my health and work life. But I’m finding I can’t make it past 2 days without the bad mood kicking in, I’ve identified that it’s the craving that is triggering it but I’ve noticed my mood will get progressively worse throughout the day until I will find any excuse to drink.

alcoholism,cancerise,2020/04/20,"I’m sober and going very strong, but I feel so guilty about having drunk in the first place....is it normal to keep looking back and regretting? (Background—I [24F] started drinking heavily (frequent blackouts) last November and first tried quitting in February. Relatively short amount of time, but drinking is drinking and I went through the terrible emotions that come with addiction—reliance on substance, sense of worthlessness, insecurity about feelings, heightened sense of depression) 

I’m not struggling with the alcohol aspect right now and I don’t see myself struggling with it in the near future either because I’m determined to get my life together. I still have a lot of shit going on, but I’d rather handle my problems sober even if it hurts to face. 

Now I’m looking back at the last few months where I’ve been drinking and I feel so disgusted with myself. I know it’s in the past and I’m better now, so why do I keep thinking about it and feeling guilty? 

I feel very stupid for wasting my time with alcohol. I’ve made poor decisions and been rude towards several people while drunk. I’ve ruined opportunities for myself because I was constantly too drunk or hungover to do anything productive. I stopped caring about my life and became hopeless cos I could forget about everything by drinking myself away. 

It’s not good to regret, but I really hate myself for having fallen victim to alcoholism for a bit. I can’t help but realise that I could be somewhere better in life right now if I hadn’t freaked out and tried to run away from my problems with alcohol. I’ve only made things worse for myself by pushing my problems aside and allowing them to grow bigger. 

I have slight hope for the future but hate my past and can’t get over it right now.",5.477774390243901,7.345741326219512,5.535946341463416,78.74076097560977,68.66463414634146,8.296780487804881,31.71756097560976,8.841846274778883,2.802962780487805,1417,61,241,25,25,445,166,328,0.282,0.621,0.09699999999999999,-0.9978,0,0,9,0,0,1,32.0,0,0,1,7,21,29,7,3,9,0,17,17,2,4,0,60,47,26,0,12,13,0,5,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,10,21,12,3,8,8,1,8,6,22,0,2,7,8,30,7,47,37,5,52,0,7,3,0,2,20,1,5,24,158,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582422923879285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896323074007989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15747250103127008,0.12887960685303335,0.0,0.1021718059942152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14823496615050985,0.09149183749425978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08544336591069403,0.0,0.0,0.07218938978791341,0.0,0.09056193094783033,0.0,0.13382072731290245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07217992674599802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4104781685932996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426778192110023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055351494227294455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07531728124260105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21186811690230486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14256661620682184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08756785502238112,0.0,0.09525504596797484,0.07029049227769797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16547743049694616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05617179347454045,0.0,0.0,0.08323589416428717,0.0,0.0,0.08971349808524398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14897699874193285,0.0,0.0,0.046056272562819286,0.13662225501394448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17757890494962764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14074785233364298,0.0,0.0,0.0712468326249243,0.0,0.15859400468992293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06689124220211726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08210974489507374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06373642196249124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16000005720003865,0.05809887151798573,0.0,0.08755693606607952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2405662113744109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913545513599433,0.0,0.0,0.053686738667236264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2147034758830534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06678062731284476,0.0,0.0,0.09467422588083448,0.08602320167465513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05931662669960067,0.0,0.06692567143284968,0.0700635706815071,0.0,0.1752194583838452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05567539490462388,0.053697969633738615,0.0,0.0,0.09773311818427204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11379430074983345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13829351023019382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07768678633326949,0.07561972347092552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08540303843042857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Fatpostman39,2020/04/20,"I only drink beer. How bad is my detox going to be? I have been drinking since my 21st bday. I turned 33 a little less than a month ago. I have slowly but steadily increased my consumption over this time. Used to be I would drink a 6 pack on friday or saturday night with friends but that turned into buying beer to keep in the fridge at all times, I even have a kegorator now.

Currently I drink light beer, but I drink the 16 oz cans. I drink anywhere from 5 to 12 of these a night. With so much liquid (volume) going in I tend to urinate a lot. Since I drink beer and not hard liquor, I want to tell myself that I don't get as drunk... i start when I get home M-F around 5-6:30 and I drink until I go to sleep which is 11-1am usually. On weekends I start around 3-5 and stay up that late. I am an avid video game player and I think this is my psychological tie in. I used to smoke a lot of weed while playing games but now it's beer. 

I don't drink hard liquor at all. Maybe 2-3 times a year when a family member gives me a shot at a birthday party or while playing a round of golf I will do a shot at the turn.

With all of that being said, I hate the way I look in the mirror, I have gained 30 pounds in the past 4 years (50% is in my face it feels like)

I wanted to get some advice from someone that has been in a similar situation as me. Not a vodka/whisky/rum drinker (no offense) but someone that drinks between 64 - 192 oz of beer a night, every night for a period of lets say at least 3+ years...

Is a medical detox necessary since I only drink beer? What are your symptoms during detox like? Is this something I can do during the week or do I need to take off of work?

I am looking forward to getting my life back and being able to save $250 a month by not spending it on beer.

alcoholism,JiraiyCZ,2020/04/20,"I am probably an alcoholic. Can I learn to drink moderately or do I have to be 100% sober for the rest of my life? **Introduction:**

Hello everyone I am 31, male. I am Czech and in our culture we get drunk sice 14 years old and it is considered ""normal"". Ever since I started drinkig I had problem to stop when I had enough, so lets say in 70% of all cases I was the drunkest person in our social group. Some times it was funny, but oher times it was embarasing and there is lot of stuff I wish I have not done.

*There are 2 main reasons I drink so much:* 

1. I am quite ambitious and to this day I have not achieved my goals which makes my very unhappy. But I am finally getting there. Few more months and I am set I hope.
2. I am socially anxious person and I feel that I need to drink more to loosen up and be a good companion. Which works fine until the time I over do it and become a ""zombie"".

**Possible sollutions:**

One soulution would be to ditch alcohol all together but that. Mainly because of the social stigma. It is hard for me to be with friends and say: ""Sorry guys i cant have even 3 beers because I cant control myself."" Immediately people judge you for lack of self control. So rather than that I would like to discover some tool for self control.

I have tried an app for my phone which roughly calculates alcholol content in my blood - that kinda worked but I have to really put in the info and stick with it, which sometimes failed.

My other idea is to try 6 months of 100% sobriety to learn how to be in social situations without alcohol. Maybe when I push through it sober I will learn that I dont need alcohol to be interesting and calm.

And finally I kinda hope that if I achieve my goals, it will boost my self confidence and I will become more calm person (up to this day my career is very stressful.)

**My questions for you:**

1. Does anyone here have similar experience with possible solutions that I have pointed out?
2. Did anyone try to push through their social anxiety and realized that that really dont need too much alhocol after that? 
3. Did anyone drank in their younger years and after they matured achieved some level of selfcontrol?
4. Do you have some advice to control drinking but not ditching it all together?

&amp;#x200B;

**I am really thankful for any advice in advance.**",1.4344450971177949,4.072268970982143,3.094459586466165,86.87575971177947,86.96875,6.53671679197995,23.707863408521305,7.793537801064563,1.5958520833333345,1801,71,348,38,57,593,216,448,0.051,0.825,0.124,0.9903,0,0,10,0,0,0,75.0,3,3,3,15,16,13,0,1,9,0,51,13,1,7,4,70,64,29,0,13,12,0,3,1,2,5,5,2,0,8,27,20,11,5,9,6,0,4,8,3,0,1,9,5,55,10,53,43,19,39,0,1,0,0,31,14,0,12,21,254,82,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13576552424832827,0.0,0.2969581967284542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07526792419016765,0.08441052297392147,0.04724023002600142,0.0,0.0531423887316711,0.07847841528378494,0.0,0.1457197128394719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08469339301702725,0.1534426226513926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.311654488944128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08960148234462656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060791410317294875,0.0710892926741542,0.16283060562913151,0.27220651348416186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07177841814631761,0.0,0.04588257796810781,0.06283726151649319,0.0,0.06637909998396806,0.0,0.06795246980205086,0.0,0.0,0.03512481651464658,0.0,0.0,0.15219633350574627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05367035896853156,0.0,0.07258772308956242,0.0,0.0,0.05826597885695053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06878367078169262,0.0,0.0,0.062229166540356914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13799365155547494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842026537251469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07103514695016308,0.04906689551676538,0.03393827411986417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05905871916429387,0.0,0.0,0.046370044517901936,0.0,0.06978936382402487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11089646914026033,0.0,0.10213309839133784,0.15452764261447333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06806332556478506,0.0,0.0,0.07289437514062072,0.0,0.047072923901528535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04815996459529286,0.18196882379031712,0.0,0.0,0.06566916893318796,0.15662816433829013,0.0,0.0,0.07489763171418315,0.06647094237753418,0.0,0.06983394751046708,0.07781941253278317,0.07388715566025905,0.0,0.0,0.13350783066330782,0.0714240809997507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1104865665522636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174090185477608,0.0,0.0,0.057464170462068004,0.07808429443047762,0.0,0.3540664493961912,0.0,0.0,0.06870505798300315,0.0777630930726851,0.049169399802896765,0.0,0.0,0.05807787647642362,0.0795746987559064,0.0,0.0795235798147233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395627018958631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215210396148147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14149146150527736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463579898248275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988410854507898,0.06696411717073919,0.0,0.10114622312194822,0.0,0.0,0.09869532887805592,0.0,0.08441052297392147,0.08946948613311755

Unfortunately I relapsed badly last week, drinking a fifth of vodka for the past 7 days. I have been trying to taper with beer but its like I can't make it more than an hour without redosing.

My hands have pins and needles, feel numb, and twitch. I am constantly dry heaving. I havent slept in over 48 hours because any time I try to close my eyes and lay down I have weird 'internal' hallucinations. My face is twitching as well.

I am living with my parents, and they think I should just 'tough it out', but I am deathly afraid. What should I do? I have no medical insurance, but I'm about ready to call 911 and just deal with the bill whenever I am stable again.",2.563877551020408,4.78076685034014,3.4356122448979605,89.13260204081635,77.77551020408164,6.648979591836735,24.105442176870746,7.7094869923839395,1.1382870748299312,585,20,121,9,14,186,107,147,0.106,0.8109999999999999,0.084,-0.0507,1,0,3,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,1,0,6,8,0,1,4,0,15,10,4,1,0,21,21,9,1,2,6,1,2,1,0,2,4,0,0,0,4,10,2,0,2,3,1,1,4,6,1,1,3,3,19,2,18,16,1,19,0,0,1,0,4,6,0,0,12,76,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12961067954101507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14655527438639893,0.3182766073237865,0.11618453398225663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19461811972705187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2059647598732414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12291757478929773,0.19649438432558528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18670988249186032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09637021950805597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753940437045804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15535981649672406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09311476190322793,0.0,0.16829828443876388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12722319465854434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920037350204268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15213057510576394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21163244713920107,0.0,0.1819438533167692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20314819543031726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12212515022084512,0.0,0.0,0.11113708601290027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2588020770270952,0.0,0.18618296508430907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15726028215430807,0.0,0.0,0.15288327432539398,0.0,0.17136719131300818,0.17668285255173224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837261318707915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I just went 3 days whitout drinking because my car would not start and I'm way too fucking lazy to get beer at the store 5 min away. I'm not sure if it's stress but my face has broken out so bad I have to wipe it down even at work. I took 1/4 of a xan the other day and man I just felt so on point like everything was fine and I had my shit under control. I crave this feeling so bad... Sometimes I wonder if I should actually take benzos as a medication, and maybe I could turn my life around.

alcoholism,not-patrickstar,2020/04/20,Liquor while working Anyone else have trouble being productive and motivated without a shot or two or 3 in your system. I can go days or weeks or however long without a drink I wouldn’t consider it a craving but I pretty much have no desire to do my retail job without it and I can really only enjoy my work and feel proud of myself and my sudden motivation and satisfaction from a job well done with a little liquor in me. If I don’t have a drink while I’m at work I just don’t do anything and it’s gotten progressively worse with time. I’ll spend the first few hours of my shift dragging along or my entire shift if I decide not to drink but the relief of the I don’t want to do this or lack of motivation whatever that feeling is that keeps you from doing what you know you should be doing goes away with just a little liquor. The reason I started drinking at work is a result of the feeling not a consequence of it. I dragged ass at work months and months and months before I realized that liquor would soothe the anxiety and just let me do what I need to do and be proud of it.,6.891610273134937,5.441759367713008,7.502910721565431,77.37836119037917,65.18834080717488,10.440929474113332,31.48348960456584,9.339509955726095,2.501191928251121,861,25,177,13,11,287,113,223,0.083,0.7170000000000001,0.2,0.9819,3,0,4,0,0,0,6.0,0,4,0,12,4,6,0,0,15,0,25,9,1,5,0,51,36,22,0,9,18,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,11,14,8,1,10,8,2,1,10,1,1,2,2,3,24,5,26,27,3,23,0,0,0,1,4,8,1,8,13,135,35,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906456185453603,0.0,0.0,0.08140684355977924,0.11929084352463168,0.09580759196171013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10938481972267604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09906882795630248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07508428729874826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1191428698574672,0.0,0.4562074538995862,0.0,0.0,0.09725788120396428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.176603449774938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990307736914552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06616682889168762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11465485824980545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310670613920593,0.10348360535009044,0.0,0.0,0.06398395959154833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11905212374501982,0.0,0.0,0.2333762312878473,0.0,0.10303217850251613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27878720747001434,0.0,0.08558553610565822,0.08632742532121157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0885462157580274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184457554174116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07458463150271458,0.11970396197705226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08240598803729766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06788816741660007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11372999560466635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06867029297240584,0.0,0.0933888560061364,0.0,0.10467976974148514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3366877119074594,0.0,0.4237927697926696,0.0,0.11864669578882425,0.08270475258458496,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,nickkkkk77,2020/04/20,"My (alcoholic) experience beating coronavirus Hey there everyone, I’m making this post so people can get an idea of what it’s like to contract coronavirus while battling alcoholism. *Should throw out a disclaimer that I think my recovery could have been a lot smoother if I wasn’t drinking so I definitely recommend abstinence if possible

I have had an alcohol use disorder for about 3 years now (21). I am in good health which may have strongly  assisted in my recovery. I hope everyone practices social distancing unlike I did, as it is the best way to preserve good health. 

The following is a day by day description of the symptom progression- 

Day 1- had gone out drinking with some friends the night before the symptoms first manifested and I was developing what can only be described as a very irritated sensation in my lungs, as if my lungs were  smouldering coals every time I inhaled. It was cool outside and the cold air exacerbated this feeling, so I assumed it was probably the copious amounts of cigarettes I had indulged in the previous night. 

Day 2- the burning sensation worsened throughout the day but I finally accepted that I was most likely developing the early symptoms of what I thought was probably a cold. Started to cough a lot

Day 3- finally started feeling under the weather, the irritated sensation in my lungs was driving my dry cough that only seemed to get worse. Felt fatigued all day and towards the end of the night I started developing a mild fever. 

Day 4- I woke up in the morning, rendered immobile from body aches, and a record high fever that left me shivering so hard it could have been mistaken as a seizure even under three blankets. I was so fatigued I couldn’t even stand, and it only worsened as the night progressed. I had absolutely no appetite and didn’t have anything to eat all day, as I felt as though even one bite would provoke a vomit attack. I developed a very high heart rate that averaged 130 bpm that turned irregular if I exerted too much effort. I think the scariest thing I experienced throughout the whole ordeal happened that night as my lungs felt so heavy I couldn’t take even half a breath and I was left panting heavily in a prostrate position. I started to panic and consider going to the hospital. 

Day 5- much of the same symptoms from day 3 persisted throughout this day, however towards nighttime I started to drift off into a dreamlike state of disorientation. I can only describe it as hallucinations. I would start to hear voices and see myself in other places only to jerk back into reality in a completely different place than I thought I was. I couldn’t even walk myself to the bathroom because I couldn’t muster enough energy to roll over let alone stand up. I had to have my dad carry me to the washroom and back. 

Day-6 I felt significantly better on the sixth day, I was able to eat small meals and walk around however I still had a severe cough and mild shortness of breath

Day-7 all the symptoms I had started to diminish and I took the whole day to just rest and recuperate from the remaining lethargy and malaise

By day 8 i felt good enough to go out and buy 12 beers which I finished off to celebrate my recovered health 

I maintained a dry cough for about 4-5 days after all the other symptoms disappeared but I have since 100% recovered and feel good as new. 

I just wanted to reassure anyone who might be having a lot of anxiety about Covid-19, that it isn’t a death sentence (although it sure was shitty)",6.058713796115852,7.632528967542505,6.473796451851356,73.70038085478126,66.89799072642967,10.015576910153891,35.8581076540555,10.226433194817671,4.015854270546333,2810,141,477,71,46,909,307,647,0.111,0.8079999999999999,0.08,-0.9755,3,1,7,0,0,0,51.0,0,0,0,9,24,21,3,1,49,1,53,35,8,3,5,76,91,42,1,15,8,1,9,2,1,5,21,2,0,0,29,24,9,0,16,3,1,11,8,6,0,4,34,17,59,15,77,43,19,93,0,2,1,0,7,34,0,15,45,335,88,0,0.048896002892873235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15676487060537114,0.0,0.050641512734098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037405308378802765,0.0,0.0,0.03418922211139147,0.0,0.0402372441713837,0.04352780912926457,0.0,0.055626262146810684,0.0,0.07519601610896674,0.0,0.029806549527204757,0.0,0.041606897101053,0.0,0.051313338392419375,0.04324454106721822,0.0,0.054312436399175636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05126652874779268,0.0,0.0,0.07807895921198504,0.0,0.0,0.5676097824091721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05108591603933594,0.05603905546626045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09579893586459816,0.0,0.10006563571982717,0.0,0.0,0.04330734546052819,0.10104528342759854,0.0,0.16147674380778307,0.0,0.04119699130455811,0.0934444523126211,0.0,0.04782967323657728,0.0,0.0,0.07416986466941818,0.0,0.2347391534717917,0.10712636230280596,0.0,0.041590915082143326,0.0,0.0,0.03777693054325442,0.0,0.051092286806860746,0.0,0.05557745050569743,0.16404658948559098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04323857387663845,0.0,0.043801214438271806,0.0,0.0,0.15592249378484405,0.05510934891351511,0.05794199885312978,0.0,0.10332262326632977,0.0,0.048564763590250484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055197635624126364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10625130042176074,0.04999947576351384,0.0,0.04777623436190393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12470889936573165,0.0,0.0,0.032638461614677816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05187093209807397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188837634492355,0.0,0.0,0.04722406428421641,0.0,0.22942793204443265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03313319699871198,0.18593806769152907,0.0,0.05736892416242726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0338983318249967,0.0,0.10217183207867188,0.0,0.0,0.05512289650227874,0.046828854667781805,0.0,0.10543632222694484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03896378371878459,0.04451308462823371,0.0,0.05523856557505963,0.0,0.04044727887033675,0.0,0.0,0.049843317330443344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24226189759744995,0.0,0.039048411071790384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04608390406610786,0.3049300137049457,0.036763708992799085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032484331651440365,0.06266116863937934,0.04804007458368138,0.07763592912083588,0.028511652498073633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0543252583312502,0.0,0.053184810306759374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04223044731409163,0.0,0.0806886463806004,0.028840129357968126,0.03881137117476696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918128210592376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04982920425023057,0.06946863512047759,0.0,0.0,0.0314874227445839
alcoholism,chateaudechelsea,2020/04/20,"Questions about alcohol detox I’m an addict with 18 months clean time and very familiar with opiate detox, but not alcohol. 
My partner is an alcoholic (well, he hasn’t admitted it yet) and has been in the hospital for two weeks after detoxing cold turkey at home and seizing 24 hours in. He tried to quit drinking for me. 
He has pancreatitis, pneumonia, and he’s jaundiced. 
I didn’t realize the extent of his drinking because he hid it that well and was a functioning alcoholic. Turns out it’s almost a gallon a day of vodka. 
He’s still in the hallucinating stage, I talked to him for the first time tonight and he was very confused and I honestly shouldn’t of asked to speak with him while he’s still in the ICU in that state. 
My question is, well everything about alcohol detox. Will he have wet brain? Will he need 24 hour care? The nurse said this is one of the longest alcohol detoxes she’s ever seen, one of the most severe. Have you seen anyone come out of this still the person they were?",4.240841924398623,5.885551365979384,4.842659793814434,83.37880068728525,71.42268041237114,8.472302405498281,27.881786941580767,9.029198982220553,2.226370859106529,791,29,154,16,15,253,113,194,0.045,0.8640000000000001,0.091,0.8464,0,0,9,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,1,2,10,6,0,1,14,0,16,15,1,0,1,25,26,9,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,3,12,2,2,2,7,13,8,0,4,3,0,1,4,1,3,4,8,6,12,5,26,15,2,27,0,0,2,0,25,8,0,5,16,98,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11324806683356145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6661175526684884,0.10402406032702204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07263757777024299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711680747239318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06332625972860481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11596805361744306,0.0,0.0,0.10591588802987742,0.0,0.0,0.08948621398779476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06699609663628732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2035320555553892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939683392452514,0.0,0.0,0.0933635589115724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836303203892354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10420336121397084,0.0,0.204608134124271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08291861215607996,0.0,0.0,0.07702810717467097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407879457408791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907068393992088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2327460102578588,0.11049261443590352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09881675156396466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11735849355689712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2488838722440433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08349741438443041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12115030689726786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07052990181388125,0.11299513578478505,0.10147883199128116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1714291073236693,0.0,0.0,0.08332887008496306,0.0,0.28021052959698645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,DrLeePhDMd,2020/04/20,"You'd think the miserable heartburn would get me to stop In the last couple years I've developed miserable heartburn ant time I drink alcohol. At first it was only wine, then beer, now it's any booze with turn into the most painful heartburn/ acid reflux ever. It makes me so miserable and in pain. Yet, I can't stop. It used to be a day after drinking, now it's as soon as I drink and lasts days after my last drink. It only completely goes away after days of abstaining. Too bad I can't quit. 

For me, drinking is like an OCD tick. Such as turning on a light on and off so many times before being able to leave a room. I HAVE to drink. My body will not let me do otherwise. I'm what the AA community describe as Hopeless. I am not at fault. I seem to have been born that way.
