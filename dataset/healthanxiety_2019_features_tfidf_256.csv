healthanxiety,InsideTheMind____,2019/01/01,"21M,FIRST TIME HERE, THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP GIVEN TO ME. Hi guys never posted here before however I am in a very dark place right now with my life and don't really know how to start this but for a while now I have felt very low and have felt as if I am becoming a different person as I no longer find happiness in myself as I did before, I am a university student also working in retail as well as recently being signed to a modelling agency and I often feel as if I have to put a happy face on everyday and I am honestly tired of having to do this it is physically as well as mentally draining. This feeling came around I would say at least a year ago and I kind of thought that it would pass as everyone does go through periods in their life were they feel low however it seems to have stayed and feels like a black cloud hanging over me which feels worse some days more then others , I come from a very loving family and live with my Mother and Stepfather as well as my younger 3 half siblings, I am very grateful for the luxuries I have in my life however there is so much going on within me some days I often wake up feeling very down for no reason at all feeling very worthless and lonely even though my family are very supportive and caring I couldn't ask for a better family. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe my mental health has worsened due to finding out through family members that my biological father has been diagnosed with cancer and I guess this has made me realise that life really is so short and for some reason it has caused me to question myself asking "" I wonder if this is cancer causing?"" or "" what if I also get cancer one day?"" almost as if I have some sort of health anxiety and this is becoming an everyday moment, as a youngster my biological father was unable to be there for me and my mother due to his lack of love or care and the biggest blessing was my mother marrying again to a man who I can happily refer to as a real father, also a very close family member to me who I once spent a lot of time with has  recently tried numerous times to take their own life and being so distant from them for so long has not been a good feeling and has made me feel quite lonely as I am already an individual who does not really have true friends as I struggle to trust people, there have been many times were I have been invited out by others and have had to make up excuses for reasons not to go. There have been times were I have contemplated taking my own life as the feeling of worthlessness and sadness was at its most high, this feeling is very hard to explain and I am just looking for a bit of clarity on maybe why I am feeling this way or if others have experienced something similar I really would appreciate any help at all.

To individuals at work and university and others I meet I am often commented on being a very outgoing individual with a lot of confidence however deep down I often feel as if inside I am a totally different person which really does make me wonder how I became to be like this. I feel as if I lack the routine I once had in my life before and some days waking up feels as if I am just going through the motions, not long ago I would read everyday and would love to keep a journal to put my thoughts to paper, I remember heading to the gym 5 times a week running twice a week being full of energy living life to the fullest appreciating each day with those around me, where has the old me gone?. Often I have been told by others I am a very good-looking individual and in playful ways people have said"" You love yourself don't you"" or "" you are so cocky"" as I very much take pride in my physical appearance and enjoy doing my best to look as good as I can, the truth is recently I have been struggling everyday to keep a positive mindset and do the things I enjoy, having to put a mask on everyday is a task which I have become very familiar with I just want to know if others have felt the same and I would really appreciate any help which can be given I don't want to give up I don't want to carry on feeling this way I want the suffering to end or at least made easier. 

&amp;#x200B;

healthanxiety,atayz101,2019/01/01,"Panic attack head pain throat closing. Help 
Hi there 

I have a reoccurring panic attack. I get throat tightness like I can't breathe or swallow , my arms and legs will tingle, I get dizzy, my heart races, I think the end is here. Then after this part passes(5--25mins) I feel very tired and get sharp head pains. I'm terrified of having an anaphylactic reaction so I take Benadryl when I feel the throat tightness but I've been tested and have no allergies. 

Anyone else???

healthanxiety,PuffPrice,2019/01/01,"Just had the worst panic attack Was at my moms for dinner. Had a plate in the kitchen when I all of a sudden didn’t feel too great, kinda faint. Tried to walk it off and got dizzy, tunnel vision, sweaty and heart rate was through the roof. Seriously felt like I was about to die so I told my mother and wife. 

They sat me down and calmed me but it felt like it took forever. I just about told them to call an ambulance because I was sure it was the end. Easily the worst and scariest panic attack I’ve ever had. 

Fuck, I thought I was doing better.

healthanxiety,JudokaRob,2019/01/01,"I’m so tired of it all, but I can’t stop thinking something is wrong with me. I’ve never had health anxiety, but I’ve been blessed with plenty of other types. Lately HA seems to be my primary form.

Back in August I visited the ER for 104 degree fever that affected my vision, in October urgent care sent me to the ER for an uncharacteristic migraine. In November I started getting chest pain, which sent me to the ER several times out of fear. After numerous EKGs, blood tests, a stress test, and event monitor setup I’m told I’m fine, but have some PVCs. 

I’m still getting the chest pains, palpitations, and headaches, and multiple doctors ranging from primary care, to ER, to neurologists, to cardiologists all attribute it to stress. 

Last year my blood pressure used to be 121/73 when visiting the doctor, but lately it’s skyrocketed to 150/88 in the office. Taking it at home I average about 128/76, but I can see my pulse go up when I take it.

I’m so scared about a multitude of things happening to me and I can’t stop thinking about the unknown. I don’t know if I’m really okay or if there’s something wrong with me with the constant headaches and other symptoms.

How do people deal with this?",4.741072515212983,6.184171185344829,5.6521805273833685,78.84616632860043,69.90517241379311,9.079513184584178,30.026369168357,9.478462496947786,2.7456244421906697,953,38,180,21,17,313,135,232,0.174,0.713,0.113,-0.952,0,0,2,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,0,11,15,0,5,11,2,11,13,4,4,3,33,35,18,0,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,1,0,11,11,0,2,4,0,0,5,4,9,4,0,5,2,17,6,33,28,4,29,1,0,1,0,6,7,0,5,17,109,28,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09987893528388207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003934782530676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26623162211244017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14109023866800885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13460283010784152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2672697732567011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14691761087902372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364256419385606,0.0,0.07420091990803399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115454808666661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13878041505345293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309634956643062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07175300283504744,0.10642477675516486,0.2945573661173981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10069682072064964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778525735648436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09051467391454704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0836408266982613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307145046034459,0.0,0.10404034617367387,0.11885798277200628,0.0,0.14749695578963293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20102472977583252,0.0,0.0,0.09241186589593528,0.0,0.1042663165046364,0.2183099632688116,0.2991147510288314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13570304334223285,0.19633149787734924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08673903783648533,0.16731664778605704,0.0,0.0,0.07613126633933602,0.15006085497845198,0.0,0.1247567900076328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11276292850144802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2854962802453063,0.0,0.0840771108398276
healthanxiety,Chidders95,2019/01/01,"Anyone find going to the gym tough? So I try to get to the gym as often as possible as I know how good it can be for mental health and to get back to my previous standard of fitness. However, since getting HA I find it difficult as I keep focusing on my heart rate after sets or after a bit of cardio; I keep thinking ‘is that too high?’ ‘How long will it take to return to normal!’ ‘I only did 5 reps why is it beating so hard!?’

Really annoying that I can’t enjoy the gym as I keep thinking about how my heart is doing!

Wonder if anyone else is the same, and if so what they do to help!

healthanxiety,lkjhgfdsaa,2019/01/01,"Can’t function properly due to fear of MS A few years ago I was involved in a serious car accident and developed quite severe anxiety. Shortly after this I started experiencing numbness and tingling down my left side, went to the GP thinking it was MS and was basically laughed out of the surgery. Went to a walk in centre and was told it was anxiety. 

Over the years I’ve occasionally gotten numbness / tingling in my left side. Sometimes the left side seems weaker but it’s subjective not objective. 

Recently someone I knew from high school was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Since then I’ve experienced loads of tingles and numbness in my left arm, hand and foot. I’m terrified it’s MS and have spent a lot of time in bed over the past few days researching MS, crying, and doing neurological tests on myself over and over. I’m convinced I have it and my life is over. I just moved somewhere near and haven’t registered with a GP yet so it’s going to take a few weeks to get an appointment.

But this shouldn’t be how I bring in the New Year. I should be looking forward, I should be looking to tackle the year head on and look to fulfil my potential. This time next year, as we approach 2020, I want to be living my life to the full and not feel crippled by how my mental health perceives my physical health. 

I am so scared of dying, that I don’t spend anytime living. And that is a travesty that I must fight against.

healthanxiety,Calendula32,2019/01/01,"mole anxiety Hi. i'm glad to have come across this group because nobody understands my anxiety. Since having children, my anxiety has become really bad. I fear I'm not going to be around for my children. I've had a fear scares too and I have some chronic health problems. I'm on holiday now and noticed a mole was raised and a pink. I don't know how long it's been that way. I can't see a doctor for a few more days either. I scratched it a few weeks ago and the top of it came off and now the scab is sort of a shiny pink underneath. The mole seems to have been there for a year or so, but not before that (I did look at previous photos of myself). It's grown in size and changed to pinkish tinged. I am so nervous. I keep imagining that i'll die from this because I read that some pink melanomas can be life threatening in 6 weeks or so. It's awful. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old so it's even more devastating. My husband doesn't understand.

Okay so like around October this mole I had my entire life suddenly raised a little and was red. Panic panic panic. About two weeks ago it seemed to have a little white head and I “popped” it. Just like a tiny little zit. It does seems smaller and less red but there’s still this tiny darker dot right next to it. WHY IS IT STILL THERE???? Ugh and I have to convince my parents somehow.

Now I’ve been reading articles that say you shouldn’t even if farmed Scottish salmon more then once year or that it’s filled with dioxins and PCB that will give me tons of health problems.

healthanxiety,kitchensponge,2019/01/02,"Health anxiety when sick Hi everyone,  


I've had issues with GAD for the past 10 years, it's something I've learned a lot from, and managing it usually is not terrible difficult. In late November I came down with a cold, which in turn became a sinus infection. I've had semi-noticeable issues with my sinuses for the past two years but nothing crazy, mainly decreased sense of smell, and having a stuffy nose. During this time, I became paranoid of various fatal diseases, I had a ton of different symptoms, some that can be related to sinus stuff, some anxiety things. I've had a few ups and downs throughout the last month and a bit, at one point having almost a full week anxiety free.   


Anyways, do you guys have any recommendations for dealing with HA when you have an actual medical thing going on with it's own symptoms? I am currently paranoid about some kind of Bacterial Meningitis, which, while being rational is kind of a ridiculous fear. Going to the doctor is also a bit of a challenge, I can't get a GP in my city (In Canada) and have to use health clinics. I haven't had any of the super thorough scans, tests, etc. Which also makes me a little paranoid, even though I know it's recommended not to go down that rabbit hole. I feel like my mind gets incredibly caught up in that minuscule chance that it's something serious and my ignoring it is going to be the nail in the coffin.  


  
I also just wanted to mention that I know this is a positive experience for me, even though it's kind of miserable. I don't want to be overly negative, as I have had my good days during all of this, and I try to keep positive even when things seem incredibly bleak and dreary.

healthanxiety,Striker_R,2019/01/02,"Brutal bowel movements after eating and random, constant burning sensation in chest all day no matter what Hi all, just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this, my health anxiety is improving, no more panic attacks, googling has gone way down, but my stomach just wont seem to improve and this burning in my chest right between the collar bones seems to be completely random. I don't feel particularly anxious, I cant even recognize it right now, just kinda deflated to be honest but I know my thoughts remain on my health just way less intense than they were. I Don't really enjoy eating because I know whats in store for me and have gone from 187lbs to 164lbs. I had an endoscopy that they said was clear, I'll most likely need to have a colonoscopy (doctor said) and going to see a lung specialist soon. If that stuff comes up clear which it probably will any advice how you help ease your stomach? Worst part is my diet is way better than it was so like \*should shrug\* I'm thinking of taking CBD oil but iono at this point, just lost. I try not to think about the burning and the bowel pain but its so in my face its hard not to.

healthanxiety,casscass0511,2019/01/02,"its back.... i was doing so well for so long with my hypochondria but all of a sudden its back. my mind is going crazy. been a while since i visited this thread.

what has me all paranoid is last night, i was at a party with about 15 people. I went to the bathroom and when i wiped and put the toilet paper in the toilet, i noticed a little bit of red on it like blood.  i thought i was getting my period but i wasnt. i didnt see any blood after that. 

so now, I am worried that it was someone ELSES blood on the toilet paper and am concerned about being infected with HIV now. Ugh. my biggest fear. 

The reason I worry is because one person who was at the party is a gay male, and I am unsure of his status.. what if he was sabatoging the toilet paper with his blood?!

I HATE THIS ANXIETY! Literally no rational thoughts here.

healthanxiety,pollyblythe,2019/01/02,"I am just glad I have found you I have been struggling with severe health anxiety for the last six months. In the past year my life has been turned upside-down: I was bullied on my workplace, I moved to the UK from Italy and my parents divorced. And although I am living with the most wonderful man I have ever met, and I am finally doing what I love in a city I adore I feel completely BROKEN. Every night I go to bed thinking about the fact that a tragedy is meant to happen sooner than I could imagine, and that a terrible unnamed illness will take me away from the love of my life and from my dream of becoming a museum curator. Every day I make an effort to get up and I immediately start checking my breasts and my neck for lumps. I feel exhausted. I only wish I could be able to enjoy a pleasant evening at the restaurant without a cruel voice inside my brain whispering that my happiness is not meant to last. I do not want to live like this anymore. I am 27, I have the holy right to be happy and healthy and to enjoy my life. This is so unfair.
I wanted to thank you guys for putting into words all the things I constantly feel deep inside my chest. You made me understand that I am not alone in this. And I know that someday we'll get all the happyness and the peace that we deserve.

healthanxiety,doctorwho0914,2019/01/02,"I told myself that 2019 was going to be the year I beat this; two days in I’ve failed I discovered a small spot on my abdomen to the right of my belly button that is a little bit sore when I bend over or move a certain way. I’ve poked and prodded at it so much trying to feel around for any abnormalities such as a lump, that now it hurts more from all the poking. I’m not exactly sure what it is that I’m afraid I have this time since I’m trying so hard not to google anything and besides appendicitis, I am not sure what other malicious causes could explain this sort of abdominal pain. My mom says it’s probably a muscle strain. 
I do not feel anything abnormal when I press, however I carry some extra weight in my belly so I fear that I just cannot feel anything through the layer of fat. 
Not a great start to 2019 at all.

healthanxiety,cmarbo,2019/01/02,"Convincing yourself you’re ok? How do some of y’all convince yourself that you’re not dying? Sometimes I will be doing anything normal like washing my hands or driving, and I just think to myself “I don’t feel right.” I constantly freak myself out to the point I just shut down and can’t continue on with my day. This all just started abruptly two months ago so I’m really new to all this and I feel like I’m spiraling. I try my best to believe my doctor, especially the one I have now because I’ve convinced myself that my first 3 doctors were lying and it’s not just my anxiety. I’m just so tired of feeling like this and I need some better coping mechanisms. Thanks for any replies and help.

Since then I’ve researched it, learned that if you have a history of them in your family you’re more likely to get one. Now I’m just dreading randomly getting a head ache, or just “pop!” Then I’m dead. Sometimes I can’t even sleep at night because I’m scared that it could happen while I’m asleep or it could happen the next day and that this night would be my last and I wouldn’t even know it! I’m thinking about going to the doctor to get a scan, but my step-mom says that I should only get one if I experience any/all of these symptoms:

healthanxiety,beforeoddisee,2019/01/02,"Not sure if I'm having health anxiety or if there's something seriously wrong with me and doctors won't listen I've been growing more and more anxious and I stumbled across this subreddit through related searches. Basically, I keep getting the sense that I'm not well, ""off"" if you will, or that there's something worse wrong with me than all of the doctors I've seen are making it out to be. And just to be clear, I haven't gone to the doctor about random things that turn out to be nothing--it's always for strep-like symptoms, colds, or throat infections. I've had three in the past two or three months (doctors just say maybe you need your tonsils out or might be a carrier for strep), but at the same time I've lost around 10 pounds... I thought this was over the course of the summer but looking at my last medical visits I've gone from 135 (Feb 2018), to 130 (Oct 2018), which is normal weight fluctuation for me, but then from 130 to 125 (Nov 2018) and then my most recent visit (Jan 2019) for my third throat infection my weight was 121 pounds. I'm a 5'4 woman and I keep telling the doctors about my concerns (different doctors too) but none of them seem really concerned. Is this normal?? They suggested maybe I was eating better, which might be true, but I really haven't consciously changed my eating habits and idk if I'm eating more or less than usual because I've never thought about it that hard... Can anyone help me?? Should I chill out?? Should I see another doctor, and what would I say to get them to take me seriously? This is causing me a lot of stress and I feel okayish but I'm uncomfortable with the amount of weight loss I'm experiencing and it only seems to be getting worse.",4.174610778443114,5.6096092994012,4.564711377245512,86.13148622754494,71.27544910179641,7.619449101796408,26.533652694610787,8.109356740369918,1.5149596646706596,1342,44,271,19,25,423,173,334,0.107,0.85,0.043,-0.9435,1,0,2,0,0,0,49.0,0,3,3,3,10,11,0,1,12,0,26,20,2,2,5,65,53,28,0,10,20,0,5,0,0,7,12,3,0,1,15,18,6,2,6,0,0,6,7,7,1,4,11,13,29,4,40,29,10,27,0,2,3,0,15,11,0,17,10,172,44,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0690802186161818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08705487814110521,0.063510925969116,0.0937902292730693,0.0,0.05805029415794773,0.0,0.0,0.07390639411953477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05060890131545767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07342542984740927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528555463638936,0.08782533178506105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08673939534949474,0.0,0.5948294059397937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25485398160181755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041977970403332926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301253185292107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07437061230386506,0.0,0.0,0.08824756332625233,0.0,0.0,0.055647303578567266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14758596374484007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06767328965377674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06971682745354665,0.0,0.09062735451450787,0.07058158336866187,0.0,0.0,0.055417239135243435,0.0,0.16681173823930093,0.0,0.0,0.08363503940491795,0.0,0.1761445672399112,0.0,0.0,0.06626666216836763,0.0,0.0,0.061559105041514614,0.06403100221220091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16268613189307693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06314129926376594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07925304859310013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10637090468236446,0.0,0.0819733356211626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13204344622733644,0.0,0.0,0.06615708011761033,0.15115861063628172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12782742121215587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951004070821744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07824641865989877,0.08629072701862409,0.06242154660366206,0.0,0.07256411407986776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055155540004583566,0.0,0.0,0.13181898400632205,0.048410279972146406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0903031333378406,0.08109956621257419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914360293730242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3032920572663979,0.07464595309382276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16921121837507744,0.058975818320113525,0.18154111342478144,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Amymay3,2019/01/02,"Can’t do this anymore. As the title says I really can’t do this anymore, living with anxiety and health anxiety isn’t even living it’s basically existing. It’s got to the point that it’s changing who I am as a person, I’ve become jealous of people for being able to just live their lives, I feel like I’m becoming a bad mum and partner through it and I’ve decided it’s time for a change. Instead of going to the doctor for yet more tablets I’ve decided to overcome it myself, eating better, sleeping better, avoiding alcohol (I’ve realised this does not help at all- it helps while I’m drinking and then the next day is hell) avoiding caffeine and exercising and reading more. I’ve started playing “the sims” on my phone just to keep my mind active and on something other than my health or whatever strange worry my mind decides to have that day. I’ve decided enough is enough and I’m going to push myself to do things I would never usually do and get better. Sorry for the moaning boring post but sometimes it feels good to get it out to people who actually know how you feel and won’t just say “you’ll be alright” Also a great app I’ve found is called “Dare” it’s absolutely brilliant for panic attacks and has really helped me the last few days.

healthanxiety,hoyt712,2019/01/03,"Blood test results Hi all. 

Little backstory. I recently went to my doctor for some chest pains I have been having. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder since I was roughly 19. 

These chest pains have always been an on and off thing with me, I've had scans out the wazoodle and also blood work over the years that has shown nothing.

Today my doctors receptionist called me to inform me my most recent blood work results were in (I had the blood work done roughly 3 weeks ago). This is terrifying to me as they have never called me before in results to blood work results.

My mind is pacing thinking they found something horrible as it was not discussed over the phone, I have an appointment tomorrow morning to go over the results with the doctor. My mind is going nuts thinking I have cancer or diabetes or something very life threatening has been found.

I dunno I just needed to write this down, makes me feel a little better in a way.",5.548200782268577,7.206497796610173,5.786666666666665,77.82555410691005,68.2090395480226,8.609995654063452,29.99956540634507,9.057496981413335,2.6553341156019123,758,29,130,14,13,241,103,177,0.149,0.8370000000000001,0.014,-0.9749,0,0,2,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,2,5,2,3,0,0,10,0,21,16,7,6,2,32,31,7,0,1,4,0,3,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,6,0,0,3,2,2,0,0,13,4,22,1,22,18,3,24,0,0,1,0,9,12,0,5,8,92,28,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11008824555153107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993158743042614,0.10333725245051446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500613521074043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10567779448978107,0.0,0.0,0.10983726358173262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25362675418655106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12605172861989505,0.0,0.0,0.14233418494490513,0.3813456983236546,0.0,0.12709099295364346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06279493915662426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27233907503650273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411617496623758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087720108581775,0.0,0.24894495995970625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289877110041065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25079596493457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920864019502771,0.09578411841782587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11916506566466616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2642969620944052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2452481896260401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10273246797877976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19121732328745927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08250729478964021,0.15915375967303882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11771899296081804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10247096976683588,0.0,0.09857740885873063,0.09961890673628783,0.0,0.0,0.11512673762331095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3616514793303818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07997523539746929
healthanxiety,marissacool,2019/01/03,"Coping methods you use? (venting) I was finally approved and am able to afford health care and I scheduled an appointment for the GP and the Dentist because of a small bump I have sort of under/in front of my ear by my lower jaw on the right side.

But I am sort of terrified, and am obviously fearing the worst, I just wanted to know what coping methods you have. 

Bleh. I'm sorry I need to vent a little too. I've always had one tonsil larger than the other on the right side too, and I like freaked out about it when I was 15 or 16, but it never grew or anything. I've had jaw pain on and off for a few years I think mostly when my wisdom teeth started growing in. I also get earaches, tinnitus, and jaw popping (again mostly on my right side). I know this sounds like tmj, but now I found this bump and I am just terrified the bump has been something more sinister, and I could never afford to do anything about it, and I am just ashamed of myself. 

Also like I need to get work done on my teeth, and I am just a mess. I am happy I got insurance finally so I can see a doctor and maybe a therapist tbh. Bleh. I'm sorry if this is triggering for you guys, I am in such a bad place mentally at the moment, and I feel incredibly alone. It's gotten to the point where I kind of wonder why I am here sometimes. 

Like trying to be positive is so difficult. I try but it never sticks, and I don't know how I got here. 

I am so sorry if this is triggering at all to anyone. If anyone has any coping skills, or ways to distract yourself that would be incredibly helpful. I'm already doing the ""don't google your symptoms"" while I wait for my dr. appointment (which is on the Feb. 1). So anything you got, let me know.

healthanxiety,throwaway6464920,2019/01/03,weight loss I feel I should mention I've always been underweight with a high metabolism. I was recently sick last week with bronchitis which made me lose my appetite and since I've healed I also have stppped smoking weed. My eating habits are coming back but one thing that is concerning me is over the course of that week and a half I have lost 6-7 pounds. Rationally I know this is because my eating habits have changed when I was sick and because I no longer smoke. I know you guys aren't dieticians but if you'd include tips to regain those lost pounds that'd be much appreciated.,4.363070175438594,6.1564267105263175,4.462280701754388,85.63096491228073,71.36842105263158,7.873684210526315,26.701754385964907,8.515128840125781,1.7247964912280702,471,16,94,8,9,146,77,114,0.16699999999999998,0.7929999999999999,0.04,-0.9072,0,0,1,0,0,0,6.0,0,2,0,4,3,4,0,0,3,0,15,6,0,1,0,14,22,8,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,1,7,6,3,0,3,0,0,1,2,4,0,2,6,2,16,0,5,12,1,9,0,4,0,0,4,2,0,1,6,57,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517975071965928,0.1579439080853969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14595844174888425,0.0,0.23142276668473516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20080243532668596,0.1635115298925769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.388462714330842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959777608092635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1879498131788275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005532988277845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2086381838112436,0.15472712818556122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21235795795576384,0.4144178706495611,0.0,0.0,0.17961052458557816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13953818212865654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12862569200695018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18742252480031185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1570195364696441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261067453953272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3045213430008442,0.2311473712519189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I felt a pain on my left side that felt deep and biting. It subsided shortly but since then I had what felt like a mass in my chest. I’m not new-comer to chest pain either. Last year I was diagnosed with having PVCs (preventricular contractions) which are benign but ended up requiring me to get a Halter monitor and Echo. Those results indicated my heart was fine. Now, however, I was panicked thinking I might have a respiratory problem. I started googling lung cancer symptoms, bone cancer symptoms, the whole nine yards. One night, I had a full blown panic attack thinking I was going to die from what felt like a huge tumor growing in my chest. And that damn pain never went away, I paid attention to the tightness I felt in my chest all the time, it was inescapable. While at times I would be distracted and not notice it, a large portion of my day is spent studying and during those times of quite my mind would be drawn to the tightness I was feeling. I should also mention I’m in medical school, so learning all of the pathologies that could happen to a person made anything I felt be drawn to the worst diseases I’ve since come to learn. 

It was only last week that I actually discovered this subreddit, and I became sure my chest pain was related to anxiety. The anxiety of school, the anxiety of my chest pain, and the anxiety I had regarding my own mortality after a recent friend passed away. And what made it worse was that all of these things were acting as a positive feedback loop. For example, I’d stress about an exam, which would provoke my chest pain, which would make me more anxious which lead to worse chest pain and on and on. Maddening. Even though I knew how incredible rare it would be for a young non-smoker to be diagnosed with a disease like lung cancer, it was always where my mind went. 

In order to rule out actually having a physiological problem, I got an X-ray done today and it came back negative for anything. Though, I question if that was the right thing to do. I don’t want to be a hypochondriac, and get needless and expensive tests done. And in some ways I felt like I “gave” in to my emotions. However, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t much more relaxed knowing that my problem stems from anxiety, and not pathology. 

I write this only to say that chest pain is scary, but more often not a life-threatening ordeal. I hope to calm those who come here freaking out about a symptom similar to mine. And while I still have the pain, I now understand it and accept it. 

Our bodies are weird, and no one has the same body as you or will experience the same symptoms as you. My body likes to give me chest pains which are sometimes chronic, sometimes short, sometimes after a tough exercise. But after having run the gamut of tests, I’m actually just - fine. 

TL;DR: Chest pain turned out to be nothing but anxiety after extensive testing. You’re fine.

healthanxiety,throwaway7272738,2019/01/03,"Is it possible to create symptoms of a sickness I’m fearing? For the last few weeks I’ve been obsessing over a possible brain tumor. I’m 17 and I feel that my vision has gotten worse lately, especially in the dark. (My eyesight was already bad without glasses)  I also have a lot of ‘floaters’ in my sight and sometimes a green tint as if I looked and the sun and looked away quickly. I’ve  been tired the last couple of days even though I got plenty of sleep and sometimes when I’m holding my phone it feels light for some reason, I guess I title that with light headedness. Although I have experienced migraines I know this is something entirely different. Symptoms I haven’t felt are Severe headaches, vomiting or seizures. I’ve been a hypochondriac since I was a kid and I hate it and I can’t help but fear these symptoms. I plan on seeing some sort of doctor in the future, but I wanted to get it off my chest now.",3.5474217311233933,5.3965569281768,4.371248618784532,85.21495764272561,73.64088397790056,7.036611418047882,28.08876611418048,7.793537801064563,1.7603919705340705,728,29,140,10,15,234,111,181,0.123,0.847,0.029,-0.928,1,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,6,5,1,3,11,0,13,11,3,1,0,25,29,16,0,2,5,0,3,0,0,0,8,0,0,1,8,8,0,1,5,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,8,11,19,0,19,21,4,17,0,0,5,0,3,7,0,7,9,92,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1468810474790186,0.10644138991343688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12505343859013468,0.0,0.111134368725315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485855284569664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1472745111922479,0.0,0.08583959213539337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390629583676399,0.0,0.13623524084621366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879124245680285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995528579048137,0.13460044832075746,0.0,0.1277985153534976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06954015024081334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645359707442788,0.0,0.14662654029357006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13141038312837822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892152709808208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314921925932116,0.21699131804656305,0.1501445271085249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2235438288365465,0.0,0.0,0.11315831462705148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3001043597024929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136850726600319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10606483064645268,0.0,0.0,0.15036704713169546,0.0,0.11010311047958801,0.0,0.13319783510729935,0.0,0.0,0.10246819961474604,0.2632819904570797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41503092328072827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13077175491313048,0.0,0.0,0.15298083633230738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850683748405983,0.0,0.10676616370694876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283052993148983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13564201434318673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,OkFinal,2019/01/03,"Pinky keeps shaking Shot in the dark... 
Anxiety seems to be at all time high, to the point where I have accepted something is neurologically wrong with me. 
I’ve had a lot of symptoms to which my neurologist did the emg study and and mri. 
He gave me the all clear. 
I have a lot of other symptoms, but the main one at the moment is that I can’t seem to beat is my left hand pinky. 
Can extended periods of anxiety cause muscle weakening. My dang pinky won’t stop shaking when I try to use it or extend it from my ring finger. Can’t tell if this is stress/anxiety related. It seem to shake like it is weak or something. It shake worse and less at different parts of the day.

healthanxiety,Overpoweredtoast,2019/01/03,"One calf bigger than other, just noticed So I just noticed my left calf is bigger than my right. I'm not sure how long it's been this way, I never really look and examine my legs. There's no pain or discoloration. I've obviously had the whole DVT thing pop into my head and have been debating going to ER. I'm 21 years old and in pretty good shape. 

I play basketball a lot, and if any of you guys play ball, you know that right handed players will often jump off their left leg. I've done this for most years I've played basketball(nearly 10 years), as I never really go left, and thus never jump off my right foot. Could this be a possible explanation?",3.510454545454543,4.853518833333332,4.844363636363639,83.84154545454548,72.78787878787878,8.31030303030303,21.53333333333333,8.841846274778883,1.2033278787878792,514,11,108,10,10,171,90,132,0.057,0.841,0.103,0.7271,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,2,1,0,6,6,0,0,3,0,9,6,5,2,5,24,15,10,0,2,5,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,7,6,0,0,2,4,0,4,5,1,1,1,4,2,12,5,10,8,3,26,0,0,1,0,4,13,0,5,8,63,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09617665363023027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11291964673312717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14473109624100014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16075485997174735,0.11862403853382715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14003706748560454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14514708277104285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07772574745432198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.460989468724332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12516032357292564,0.11876484370615847,0.0,0.0,0.1202379830450228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3272365760682875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3220359884420312,0.1484060739253975,0.0,0.0958360341375905,0.0,0.15049055864659808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15944008636294935,0.0,0.14388426304623672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812062357240988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3623390955333921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332952749305974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09395922516035116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11225985506246966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1579005653981408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27322715533656405
healthanxiety,Ladym01,2019/01/03,Worried about my stomach Started last night. I was drying clothes and I felt my stomach balloon up with gas so bad that I couldn’t stand. It wasn’t painful just uncomfortable. I started to panic. I went upstairs to my bedroom and took antacids because it’s all I had. Then I had to use the bathroom. I was still in panic mode as I could barely take a deep breath. It eventually went away but here I am sitting at work and my stomach is swelling up again and I’m scared it’s going to kill me. I just took a gas pill about 10 mins ago but it’s not working and I’m drinking water. It’s so uncomfortable it feels like I’m pregnant probably looks like it too. Can you die from having gas in your stomach like this? My anxiety is making it worse ,0.8288235294117641,3.2001227647058847,2.378594771241829,93.14867647058828,86.05882352941177,4.70718954248366,24.83986928104575,6.139981653823899,0.6476379084967321,585,25,124,5,18,190,91,153,0.231,0.7090000000000001,0.06,-0.9798,0,0,1,0,0,1,11.0,0,2,0,2,10,9,1,3,3,0,12,10,5,2,1,18,28,11,2,2,5,0,2,3,0,0,3,0,1,0,11,6,2,0,2,1,0,5,3,6,0,0,10,3,19,3,15,16,1,23,0,0,1,0,2,7,0,0,12,78,30,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1412271258998362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218789830961884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14968591678173368,0.0,0.13302512954586074,0.09711968978286943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12720365855021584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16534848996433288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15607245857503485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08055672732102859,0.11381788419573595,0.15297170673355534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905449446120828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17626342402154513,0.0,0.0,0.1298666583728746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335063836885977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13378825619488866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063470048458463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495105602031765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16952718318677787,0.3738542170234492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17177336976192836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15950661520078238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2255343273214787,0.0,0.12723276024770694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.119788438087727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3540196581083465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13760089670201486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2953815493617632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23197299015609335,0.1617966880232886,0.16236018377412864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I woke up this morning and noticed something had changed on my body.  The more I looked at it, the more I was disturbed.  The skin on the back of my hand had a different texture.  It almost looked like a burn scar.  Instead of smooth and straight, it was more wrinkly and bumpy.  My thought was wow, can aging of the skin happen overnight?  

The weird thing is the texture has gone back to normal now and my other hand didn't do the same thing.",3.364782608695652,5.4014387391304375,3.003695652173913,94.01032608695654,74.65217391304348,5.469565217391305,27.80434782608696,5.985473137389443,0.8462782608695654,372,15,77,2,8,110,59,92,0.047,0.8029999999999999,0.151,0.8829,1,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,1,10,0,10,6,6,0,0,8,16,4,0,1,0,0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,9,8,7,2,8,7,4,10,0,0,2,0,2,5,0,1,5,54,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2437360781943978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37432857718767787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270369337272315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25749140992125463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543075983922169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2410103359111059,0.2152432359636182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118915939683299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4087996898248912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2384863263500305,0.0,0.2771194910870919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18738592980820826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32341643286940897,0.0,0.0,0.1932372776526686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Cool_spot_7up,2019/01/03,"Embarrassed ashamed and defeated My health anxiety had been terrible lately. Honestly if I described my symptoms to certain people they would have probably suggested I got to the hospital. Anyway my latest worries are that I seem to feel like I'm struggling for breath at times and having random heart palpitations.

This is one of those situations where as a sufferer of health anxiety your brain puts you on the spot and you have to make a decision. Do you

A: write it off as anxiety and try your best to get on with life.

B: jump to a conclusion that you are probably dying and seek medical advise.

Guess what I did. After the doctor listened to my heart and lungs and said it sounds fine but we'll Do some blood work as I hadn't had any in a while and an ECG just to be sure. So I spent all Christmas worrying that I'm dying of a serious lung or heart problem and today the day finally came for the blood test and ECG. Now even the thought of blood work makes me feel sick.

 I layed on the bed and had the ECG done and when it came to the blood test she stuck the needle in and I had a panic attack and she couldn't get the blood from me. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself I can't remember feeling any lower. I tried to hard and iv been worrying about this whole thing for quite a while.

Now I'm convinced I'm gonna get a phone call saying to immediately come in because I have a serious condition. I just really need a shoulder to cry on I think.

healthanxiety,BlueBumbleb33,2019/01/04,"Worried about my gallbladder - how to stay calm until my next ultrasound. (Quick background: I've had health anxiety since my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, and it's gone through the roof in the year &amp; a half since she died.)

A year ago my doctor discovered a small polyp on my gallbladder. It was only 3mm, but he decided to monitor it anyway just in case, which means an ultrasound every 6 months for 2 years. During my second ultrasound, the polyp was a little bigger -- this time, 4mm -- and my doctor seemed worried. But he seems like he gets worried easily, so I don't really know how I should feel... 

My mom's gallbladder was removed for a variety of reasons at 45, and it turned out hers had precancerous cells (cells that look a bit off and may develop into cancer). So my family history has me worried. I'm also concerned because (a) it's a single polyp, and single polyps are more likely to be cancerous, and (b) it's growing, albeit slowly.

I keep trying to tell myself that I'm young (mid-twenties) and that gallbladder cancer is EXTREMELY unlikely in anyone under 40, but I can't shrug this awful feeling. Gallbladder cancer kills 85% of people within 5 years (though most people are diagnosed late-stage, so who knows what my odds would be if I actually had it).

My next ultrasound is in a few weeks, and my anxiety levels are ridiculous. How do you guys find some peace when you have a test coming up?

healthanxiety,listentolions,2019/01/04,"Chest Pain Hi, I'm hoping you lovely people can help me with this.
I'm 21F, not super healthy but not overweight, just eat not-so-well.
A few weeks ago I got really sick for about 2.5 weeks. I had awful diarrhea, couldn't swallow, drink, eat, no appetite, was naseuas, had chest pains and had very high heart rates. Over this period I got 3 blood tests, a stool sample, 2 (abdominal) CTs (where you could see a bit of my chest), and a chest x-ray. Nothing came back positive. Eventually I started feeling better and started going on with my life. What may be somewhat important information is that my dad is a surgeon and I work reception for him, he had similar problems a few weeks before me.

For the last few days, I've had some loose-ish stools, a bit of weakness/fatigue, but mainly I'm concerned about a dull pain that moves around my chest. Today it's mostly been on my left side and about 30 min ago went into my left shoulder. Its not constant and it can be lower right, upper left, whatever. I'm terrified I have a pulmonary embolism or some sort of clot. I know I'm probably panicking for no reason and I hate annoying my dad with this stuff and he makes me feel crazy which doesn't help. So... Any wisdom?

healthanxiety,dumbbitchenergylol,2019/01/04,"terrified of being pregnant hiii

i'm 19 and on birth control but sometimes i'm bad at taking it on time because of the hours that i work. in september i had sex without a condom but he didn't finish in me and we didn't even have sex for very long so i know there's a low chance of pregnancy already. i've had light periods every month since then (which isn't unusual for me) but i've also had pregnancy symptoms like backpain, moodiness and headaches that my doctor said is just stress from school and work. i've taken 3 pregnancy tests and they've all been negative but i can't shake the feeling that i'm pregnant because i read so much about women who didn't know they were pregnant until later on/labor, or women that had light monthly bleeding throughout their pregnancy. 

i know that i'm overreacting but i just keep analyzing my body way too much and thinking about every random pain or symptom i get. does anyone have advice for making this anxiety go away? i've stopped googling my symptoms because every search brings me to babycenter forums but i can't stop thinking about it :/

healthanxiety,witchypoopoo,2019/01/04,"Crazy bloating Hi everyone, 

I’ve pretty much had my health anxiety under control until recently again. 
I started a super low sugar, low carb diet and gave up alcohol, well the past few days my extreme bloating had not gone down. I started taking probiotics as well. I was diagnosed with a UTI today bc of the frequent urge to pee. My lower back hurts and I have a pinching pain in my lower left abdomen as well.  My test came back negative but the doc said I had all symptoms of UTI and was prescribed macro bid. Anyway I also have a history of cysts and fibroids, I started googling and of course ovarian cancer came up. Now I’m freaking out and upset, anyone out there have crazy bloating with a benign reason?

healthanxiety,ubercool-RA,2019/01/04,"Shin indent / wearing socks? Hi all. First off I've seen about 3 doctors through my University and they have all said what I have is 'normal asymmetry'. On my inner, left shin there's this relatively thin 2.5 inch long indent feeling where the muscle/tissue just doesn't seem to be there...or maybe it was damaged. The docs told me that so long as it doesn't impede any daily functioning, hurt extremely bad, grow, or (and this is the biggest one) eventually protrude that I am healthy and in my head. 

I just feel like SOMETHING is there...I've gone to the point where I thought my muscle is deteriorating. 

However, around the area it sometimes feels like I'm wearing long socks even when I don't have any on.

Any advice for an excessive worrier like me? :(",5.317552447552443,6.5952697412587415,5.500286713286716,81.09812237762239,68.37062937062937,8.517202797202797,29.68461538461539,8.841846274778883,2.2576383216783222,595,22,114,10,10,188,96,143,0.11,0.81,0.08,-0.7545,1,0,1,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,1,1,10,6,0,0,6,0,13,4,3,0,2,15,23,7,0,1,3,0,4,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,8,4,0,0,5,0,0,2,3,3,0,2,6,6,12,3,11,16,2,21,0,2,1,0,4,14,0,2,8,66,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16782687962358725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3503767443992439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15288914623638328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433996049906978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17578792183942596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11343571841388594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26051775893658513,0.2453888177409166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14608590749915942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17625955434012053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838561948288684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866010595634008,0.0,0.0,0.2517172755107695,0.0,0.0,0.4559658196264552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17254058018555588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16827328748716355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11637861639604563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16235420252011226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16336848674434212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563498747420995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322174185843508,0.16985984563436812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13634606425174692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16410936847494462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,redddman7,2019/01/04,"Terrified of catching the flu after ENT visit. I've been a huge germaphobe for as long as I can remember. In the spring and summer it usually doesn't cause me to much distress, but once cold and flu season pick up, it starts to have a greater impact on my mental health and my ability to function. 

Earlier today, I had my bi-yearly appointment with my ENT to get my ears cleaned out (I produce a ton of wax). I was super anxious going into the appointment as there is a very bad cold going around my area right now, and the flu is widespread. I took hand sanitizer with me and was prepared to grab a mask if the waiting room was busy. 

Thankfully, there wasnt a single patient in the waiting room. I was called back quickly,  the nurse took some info, I sanitized my hands, and then my ENT entered the room. He shook my hand, and then sanitized his, and got to work cleaning me out. 

Once he finished I asked a quick question about how to avoid facial and ear pain on a long flight, and he suggested the vasalva maneuver. He demonstrated it for me, and then asked me to try it. Ordinarily, I dont touch my face under any circumstances, but since I had just sanitized my hands and since I was just pinching the outside of my nose (I was careful not to get too close to my nostrils), I figured it would be okay. So I pinched my nose very briefly and went on my way. 

On the drive home I started to think about it a bit more, and realized that after I sanitized my hands, I shook his hand, so my hands probably were not very clean when I pinched my nose shut. And I started to get really worried that in doing so, I probably exposed myself to tons of cold/flu germs that will infect me in the coming days. 

Now I'm anxious as can be, trying to find some rational reason why I shouldn't be worried here, so I can calm down a bit. I havent had any luck yet. Can anybody help me out here? 

Also, just for the record, I'm seeing a therapist twice a week to help with these things. We just started back in October, but unfortunately he's been out of town all of December for the holidays. I've backtracked a good bit in his absence. I'm also more anxious than usual about getting sick because I have a vacation coming up next week and I really dont want to have a cold/flu while traveling.

healthanxiety,elle_v_,2019/01/04,"how to control heart rate while at the doctors? hi!

so not only do i have health anxiety, but i have a HORRIBLE fear of the doctor. it's something new that started right around the same time as my health anxiety (yay)

while i have a resting heart rate in the upper 70s, my heart rate shoots at the doctor because i'm so anxious - even into the 140s. that's the biggest issue i have with my anxiety, is my heart just starts to RACE, and once it starts to race i panic even more. it takes a while to convince the doctor that it's not normally like that( i show them my apple watch averages lol) - and usually they'll take it at the end too (i've basically trained myself to be so scared when they DO take it, so right after they take it, i'm absolutely fine and the anxiety is gone).

&amp;#x200B;

however - i have a cardiology appointment for this monday. i have it because although my heart rate is in the upper 70s (sometimes lower 80s) while resting, it shoots up terribly  with doing just basic things (think 120-130 while cleaning house, etc). this is newer for me, my heart rate used to shoot up into the 110s, but not as high as it has been getting. i'm FREAKING out because this entire appointment is basically everything i'm already afraid of at the doctor!

&amp;#x200B;

does this happen to anyone else? it happens to my mom, too, but she has never been able to cope/fix it. i'm looking for something to hopefully calm me down in the actual office before the appointment.",5.150406698564595,6.020277423076927,5.917589252852409,79.44678873757822,68.47552447552448,8.818255428781745,30.08759661391241,8.99025400887824,2.4524643356643363,1157,43,218,20,19,379,141,286,0.163,0.799,0.038,-0.9907,2,0,2,3,0,0,48.0,0,0,4,1,13,12,0,4,19,2,20,13,6,3,1,25,40,21,0,2,8,1,0,1,0,1,7,0,1,0,21,9,0,1,1,1,0,1,4,6,0,0,3,2,24,6,35,35,5,38,0,0,2,0,7,20,0,1,18,151,45,5,0.077535853099597,0.0,0.0756638079439328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08556274194653149,0.0,0.0,0.16802012887855214,0.188429096476092,0.0,0.0,0.2372588615849168,0.08759344429940175,0.0,0.05421487128561829,0.07944464426374175,0.0,0.06902334781409845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417954091632339,0.0,0.06597730020233407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08696305225860758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3968061556142312,0.0678521475523509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06477125608135023,0.0,0.068673751985777,0.0,0.08647297188319339,0.1024233994284747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06968422522524881,0.0,0.0,0.08724939098734581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04050928307021832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371293976597729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16483397220984414,0.0,0.5512821554615988,0.0,0.08192088581345784,0.0,0.07701059703796674,0.0,0.08946596431402637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809272861889239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037880101337244745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06511058870006102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09080905404882897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05980042984413257,0.07488461008007287,0.0,0.0,0.07596867361722688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825731530545736,0.0,0.058969510181596574,0.0,0.09097161757956727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324303897967041,0.0,0.0,0.0776269151916327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11938177555024032,0.07668494130213158,0.0,0.1646408276962216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331892482996785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0515113755306935,0.04968184390569205,0.0,0.0,0.04521177946918863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06696608241065305,0.08539478800638987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188429096476092,0.0

healthanxiety,BABYPUNK,2019/01/04,"A stranger touched my face last night. Very upset and scared. Went to a gay bar yesterday with friends at about 4am last night, around closing time. My friends kind of separated from me, trying to pursue a bartender. I sat at the bar looking at my phone, when another person who was there started talking to me. I didn’t mind at first but then I noticed he was drunk. I, being horrible at small talk, decided to compliment his teeth. I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS because he then complimented mine, and grabbed my face in an effort to open my mouth to see my teeth. Luckily he didn’t get his fingers on or in my mouth, but his hands were all over my lower jaw. I struggled to remove his hands off of me, and then that asshole pushed me away. This person was a male probably in his mid 50s. 

On top of feeling like my personal space was totally violated, I have been worried sick about any germs or viruses that could have been on his hands.

Its been 2 days with the anti biotics (ciprofloxacin) and its still inflamed, arguably worse than ever. Ibuprofen helps but not enough. Sleeping is so god damn difficult. 

The dermatologist said that these things can go 'deep' which scared the shit out of me. I've let this thing just sort of stay there for years now and I am terrified that a surgery would basically take a huge chunk of the entire area out just to get rid of this thing. I actually had a surgery for it years ago but that was when it FIRST appeared, and that was bad enough. 

I hate this so fucking much. I can barely sit down, but standing hurts too for some reason, and so does laying down.

healthanxiety,JPino97,2019/01/04,"On the verge of falling back into this Hey guys. So let me just start off with a bit of background. I’ve had health anxiety my entire life. I’m a 21 year old male and about a year ago, it for really really bad. Every. Single. Day for about 3 months I fears ALS, Brain Tumors, Stomach Cancer and Esophageal Cancer.  It was awful. Well I managed to get past that and I joined the army, finished my basic and job training schools and went home for the holidays.

Well, the past few days I’ve been having some stomach discomfort and I was even in the hospital a week ago because of the pain (they told me it was just acid and the antacid they gave me seemed to fix the problem.) Now I’m extremely nervous, I’m so close to googling “stomach cancer symptoms” and I haven’t yet. I know if I do everything will come unraveled but I’m having trouble fighting this.

healthanxiety,JonnyTsunami12,2019/01/04,"Should I be concerned about stomach cancer? I’m a 24 year old male. 2 years ago I started having symptoms described below and it would come and go every couple months. So about 2 months ago I started having stomach issues with gas, being constantly full, zero appetite and little pains in my stomach. The pains faded after 2 weeks and the last 2 months it feels as if my stomach isn’t producing enough acid. I don’t know what is going on. I have zero pain during or after eating. The only symptom I have is the feeling of my food not being digested after eating and being full for hours and hours after eating. I have ZERO appetite. And also after eating my gut gets very gurgle and makes lots of noises.

I’ll even workout twice a day and fast till dinner and still have zero appetite. I usually consume 400-600 mg of caffeine wether it’s multiple cups of coffee, tea or pre workout so I don’t know if that is bad. My anxiety has been very high worrying about stomach cancer.

Anyone have any idea what this could be? Is it the caffeine? Does caffeine ruin your stomach?  Is this cancer or chronic gastritis? Should be be concerned?

healthanxiety,featurenotabug,2019/01/04,"Acid Reflux Attack Interested in other people's experiences of Panic/Anxiety attack.

Does anyone else get an attack of acid reflux when they are in a panic? My wife tends to get a lot of foamy sputum coming up when she's getting a full bore attack which appears to be due to saliva mixed with stomach acid. This, she feels, hinders her breathing and it's only once she's cleared it does things start to settle but as with all health anxiety she's still concerned this is due to something else.

This is all very new to her (at this level at least, had it low level for years).

healthanxiety,Jennings91,2019/01/04,"Blood Pressure This is for anyone with high blood pressure or blood pressure anxiety. In the past year, I've gained some weight and become a lot more sedentary. My bp about 2 months ago was around 130/82. The past few weeks I've been experiencing some pressure in my ears and throbbing eardrum. I visited my doctor and my BP reading was first 150/95 and before I left 145/89. She wants me to log my blood pressure and return it to her after about two weeks. What I'm curious about is, to be diagnosed with high blood pressure, does it have to stay elevated above 120/80 all the time or if it gets up to higher than 120/80 often it's considered high blood pressure? How exactly is high bp diagnosed? Is this something can kill me soon or is it a risk for the future? I'm a (27m) a little overweight.

healthanxiety,say-crack-again,2019/01/04,"Wtf is going on in my head? Normally I'm good at handling this, but I really need reassurance tonight. I rolled over in bed and accidentally strained the right side of my neck a bit too much. I immediately felt discomfort and started to get a dull pain shooting up my neck and into my head, all on the right half. My face felt numb-ish and now feels... not swollen, but I guess 'puffy' is the best way to describe it? I have a dull headache on the right side of my head. Totally freaking out. Should I be worried, or am I losing it over a simple muscle strain?

healthanxiety,DukeDexter1964,2019/01/05,"Helping Twin Brother Deal With Health Anxiety My twin brother (23, m) has been suffering an extended episode of anxiety for about a month regarding terminal illness and neurodegenerative diseases. Two years ago he needed to have surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, which was a major anxiety-causer. Long story short, his arm swelled up and he needed to be taken to the hospital, learned he had blood clots in his lungs, and spent the rest of the year on blood thinners to prepare for his first major surgery. Since then, he's been extremely wary of any aches and pains he feels. This December, his arm started hurting, and he got an infected salivary gland. That, combined with it being around the two year anniversary of his surgery, triggered major anxiety symptoms. Since then he's had aches and pains, tingling, fatigue, headaches, all proportional to the level of anxiety he feels at the moment.

He recognizes this, too. He knows that anxiety, something we have been officially diagnosed with, combined with the hyper-sensitivity that comes from being on the Autism spectrum, is the most logical explanation for his symptoms. But there's always that doubt, and that causes more anxiety. According to the anxious part of his brain, he's had MS, some kind of cancer, or some obscure disease that he read about on Wikipedia at some point. We have no family history of cancer, MS, or any weird diseases, and we live extremely healthy lifestyles. He even went to his doctor to see what they thought. His blood pressure is perfect, and a blood test came back with the only problem being a Vitamin D deficiency. His therapist has assured him that everything he's feeling is textbook anxiety. Despite this, he still gets panicky about every little twinge he feels. It's making him to lose sleep, causing him to feel tired and fatigued during the day and giving him more anxiety. It's a self-sustaining cycle.

Him, describing what it's like to be in the middle of an attack: ""I feel like I'm dying and no one believes me.""

Now, I suffer from health anxiety myself, but for different reasons. I hate catching colds, because they're basically a constant sensory overload for me. Besides that, I've had existential crises, and a bout of Alice In Wonderland Syndrome (yes, really), but all of these things are or were made far worse by my anxiety about them. I've been able to get through to my brother by talking about my own experience, but that only seems to work temporarily.

I'm looking for advice: Does anyone here have family members with health anxiety? If so, how do you help them? Has anything worked for you? I hate seeing my brother deal with this, and I just want to do what I can to help.

healthanxiety,HollywoodCol,2019/01/05,"Weird symptom I've been having that scares me. So for the past year I've been having this weird symptom on and off, and it freaks me out every time. It only happens when I get out of the shower. My toes will turn noticeably bright red while the rest of my foot remains regular skin color. When this happens they are also very hot when you touch them. There's no pain, numbness or tingling, Just extremely red. Normally it only happens when I get out of the shower, but I got off the couch tonight and it happened. I've done a lot of research on the possibilities and the most common answer is peripheral artery disease and that terrifies me. I suppose I'm just looking for some insight at the moment. I'm a 28 year old male, quite lean. My family has a very good medical history, but my father has hypertension. He's not overweight at all, it's more of a genetic condition than acquired. I've never been diagnosed with hypertension but I wouldn't doubt if I have it or develop it at some point.

healthanxiety,jilliayy,2019/01/06,"A person with health anxiety did the 23 and me health test and doesn’t know how to deal with the results. Hi everyone. I am a 20 year old female. Long story short I watched my grandpa, who has been my father figure all of my life, die of a heart attack suddenly after years of going to the cardiologist for monthly checkups being told he was fine. Since then, I’ve had debilitating anxiety which has mostly caused me to be a serious hypochondriac. You name it, I thought I had it. I’ve been through all the typical anxiety symptoms that have caused me to go to countless doctors getting brain scans, blood tests, etc. I’ve never checked out therapy due to always going to medical doctors. When they can’t find anything I don’t trust them I fear them from what they did to my grandpa. I stay up at night thinking about how they didn’t find something that is seriously wrong with me like the cardiologist couldn’t find my grandpas heart attack before he died from it. I have such a fear of death it’s probably insane. 

My main question here is this: I got a 23 and me kit with the ancestry + health for Christmas (like most people!) I was never worried about Parkinson’s since it was never talked about on my moms side of the family. I don’t know my dad personally, I only know of him. I knew he was Italian (which matched to what my reading was saying) but I never knew anything else. I had 2 variants detected in my health report. One major variant detected for Parkinson’s the GBA gene and one variant for Gaucher’s disease (meaning I’m a carrier.) When I say I was shocked I mean I was shocked. My mother never mentioned anything about Parkinson’s on either of my sides. I linked my results up with my moms results (she also had the test) and she also has a variant detected for Gaucher’s disease (she gave it to me I’m guessing) but she doesn’t have one for Parkinson’s only I do. 
The more research I do the more I want to cry. From what I’ve been reading I understand that I am at a high risk for Parkinson’s from my gene being a GBA and having Gaucher’s. I see that I am at risk for early Parkinson’s the one that causes the most cognitive decline very early in life. I have health anxiety to begin with (yes I know I probably shouldn’t have done the test) but I really was never expecting THIS. I don’t know where to go from here or what to think. I don’t know what I should do. All my research through various websites, scientific journals, and forums are telling me about what high of a risk I have for early Parkinson’s. I can’t sleep at night after finding this information. My heath anxiety has been through the roof. How serious is this? 
Please no judgement.

healthanxiety,Fareigner,2019/01/06,"Rabies fear Hello everyone, back again, this time with a rabies scare.

I got a new cat about 3 months ago, and she's a community stray from kind of the outskirts of Philadelphia. She's about 9 months old now and very rambunctious, and quite a cutie.

However, as she is rambunctious I somehow started looking into whether or not she could have rabies. She runs around like crazy, rolls around a lot, and loves biting me. Like, LOVES biting me. Definitely drawn blood a few times, no infections due to careful cleaning after. 

I read that rabies usually shows 2-3 months after infection, and upwards of a year, so theoretically if she was bitten before I got her (she's 100% an indoor cat now) she could start showing symptoms. 

Is it at all possible, or am I being a doof?

Also, should mention, got her all of her shots after taking her in. Not sure if that matters for rabies.

Thank you all!",3.794570858283432,6.082111850299403,4.720862275449104,81.04604391217569,74.20958083832335,7.3275848303393225,25.50459081836328,8.238735603445708,1.7736789620758482,697,24,126,12,15,226,109,167,0.076,0.7829999999999999,0.141,0.8795,1,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,1,0,1,11,10,0,2,10,0,9,6,1,0,4,26,20,13,0,5,7,0,0,2,0,1,3,0,1,0,4,9,0,0,0,3,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,1,20,8,19,12,5,26,0,0,1,2,17,5,0,6,22,87,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13157567241895668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11870071030737787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26427121651829993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11413475116236615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12630437336960426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15133592574987803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2370211360070655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1418327707248419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1670268353167088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3561429702614633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1545686875976359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14503238077051686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12464517463229445,0.0,0.0,0.1261912526164894,0.26793065859170945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3554301011665692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14335618041636922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15575401291893556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16733434565255445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15787529524810182,0.14847178447760873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486059424957756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2101213246520869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13989504219355506,0.15427728327928786,0.11160210327149002,0.0,0.0,0.13665589030894507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17310333879283507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16347645561580146,0.12247162885507985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095585094680801
healthanxiety,Frank_313,2019/01/06,"Why does my vision go black for a split second?? For a while now my vision has been doing this thing where I go blind for a millisecond a few times in a row, almost like I’m blinking without actually blinking. My blood pressure is fine, I don’t get dizzy, I don’t have anxiety when it happens, it just randomly happens. I can be doing anything and all of the sudden it’s like someone turned the lights in a room off and back on real quick. It’s strange. Is this something to worry about? Any help would be great. 👍🏼 ",3.1463207547169816,4.376191886792455,4.3831603773584895,87.23719339622644,73.52830188679245,6.809433962264151,26.45754716981132,7.1686216300943375,1.1922867924528306,404,14,84,4,8,133,75,106,0.123,0.715,0.163,0.6546,0,0,1,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,0,7,5,0,1,8,0,13,2,1,0,1,9,20,4,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,0,1,1,3,7,4,11,16,2,15,0,0,2,0,1,6,0,2,9,58,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.21712857636686209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22280229988902192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15130809840287446,0.0,0.17021241808411455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1830991087707048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17108929570344758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19471185236134508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11624742663224667,0.0,0.2529045381934569,0.0,0.0,0.24530779513375275,0.0,0.0,0.3935132489495504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14913752173247638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21740519541609826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532544956973127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1885241117590608,0.17129190080269058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478195710684575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12974194106687992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24201685696537498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20077226406631613,0.0,0.0,0.2144827242533528,0.0,0.0,0.2259602501336124,0.0,0.15805810561851066,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Fatosber,2019/01/06,"Pulse/ Palpitations in Neck Hey guys,

I just wanted to ask around if any of you have this going on as well. 

For the first time in my life, and only two days ago, I realized that I can see the veins/artery in my neck visibly pulsate. 

I have had problems in the past with palpitations, but now that I have noticed this I can’t go in front of a mirror without freaking out about it. Is this something new, or has this always been there, and I just never noticed? 

There isn’t much information about this online; not that I want to search and freak out some more.

What do you guys think, is this normal male anatomy?

healthanxiety,icecoldcokezero,2019/01/06,"Anxie-tips. Or not really. Just a story of my anxiety and how im not taking shit from it anymore Eight years ago, i was diagnosed with chronic anxiety. That time, i shrugged it off thinking, ""hey, this is normal, right? Everyone gets anxious sometimes. This will go away, right?"" Wrong. Here i am, eight years later, cringing at past me for even thinking that anxiety goes away like a seasonal flu.

I spent some time going through therapy sessions, and while those helped, they didnt really cure me of my anxiety*, because for people like me, anxiety is ever-present -- an annoying, unwanted companion i am eternally cuffed with.

I struggled battling anxiety for a long time. It was hard to be a fully-functional human when every speedbump looked like a giant boulder in the middle of the road. Instead of looking for ways around it, my focus was on the speedbump-boulder and how impossible it was to conquer it. Anxiety paralyzed me and made me feel like i was always bound to fail.

The smallest tasks would sometimes trigger anxiety and panic. I would cross the road planning my funeral because what if the bus hits me? I would get invited to parties, and yes i craved to socialize, but i would bail because what if i spill the drink and make a mess of myself? Public speaking was the worst subject ever, because that triggered so much what-ifs. I was sweating with just the thought of mispronouncing words and forgetting my lines. There were days when i thought i was perfectly fine, then i would be attacked by constant panic and pressure that took away my ability to function, and i would shut myself in, because anxiety was crippling that way.

I quit a lot of things in my life -- school, jobs, relationships -- some, i didnt even get to start, all because i worried i wasnt good enough. I was scared of taking a course i wanted because what if i couldnt find a job after i graduated? I couldnt take these programs because what if i fail them and i had to retake them? I resigned from my teaching job because i feared no one would take my subjects the following year, that i might not be a good enough instructor. I was scared to build relationships and would stop talking to people i really liked or wanted to be friends with, because what if they dont understand me?

Because that was what i felt, that no one understood me. I craved validation and support, but instead, some of the people i cared about left me for being ""over-dramatic"" and a ""cry-baby,"" only because they didnt understand what i was going through. Well, same. How could i blame them when i myself couldnt understand it?

After years of battling anxiety, i got fed up with it and i internally told it to fuck off. It didnt. But i knew i had to do something about it, or else, i wouldnt be able to really live. I knew that there was only so much i could do to help myself. So i did. I read self-help books, which, if i would be honest, really didnt help that much because they all say the same things i already knew (still good reminders, though). I started reaching out to my fellow anxious people and asked for advice, because, you know, it takes one to know one, and they were the best people to talk to if i wanted to really get myself. Little by little, i gained confidence about who i was and what i was capable of. It took years and a lot of hard work, but i learned so much, and i couldnt be any more thankful to the people who helped me and made me feel a little better about myself.

Fast forward to a few years later. I cant say that i dont get anxious anymore. After all, anxiety is already a big chunk of who i am. Maybe i just learned a few tricks to manage it somehow. Or maybe it just doesnt scare me as much as it did before.

The fact is, there is no one-size-fits-all approach in managing anxiety. Some people fight their anxiety. Some people try to ignore it. If it works for you, then it must be for you. But if there's one thing i realized for myself, it's that fighting my anxiety is a losing battle, so i embrace it instead. I take a break. I breathe. I ground myself to my surroundings. This way, i know that i have control of the environment im in. I recognize the situation and try as much as possible to think logically. I acknowledge the facts, and while i cant really do anything about my emotions, i talk about the situation to the people who care to listen. If im alone, i express what upsets me through writing. I walk. I go for a run. Not to try to escape the situation, but to shake off the excess nerves. I look back to what makes me anxious and assess what i can do about it. If i need to take a break and feel the emotions as they happen, i allow myself a few hours, or maybe a few days to let it run its course. I think to myself, ""it will pass."" It always does.

To my fellow anxious people, you got this. It is a hard road, and you may sometimes feel alone, but youre not. Be kind to yourselves. If you need to cry, do it. If you need to rest, take as much break as you need. If it's too much to bear alone, seek help.

To everyone else, anxiety thrives in a person's inability to take control of a situation. When someone feels lost, it is important that they feel secured, heard, and validated. This is why it is important to show kindness and compassion to everyone.


(*Disclaimer: Im not saying that people should ditch therapy like i did. It just didnt work for me, but im sure it helps others.

healthanxiety,dvtlol,2019/01/06,"I've been making a fool of myself for the past month This is going to be long, sorry. I just really wanted to let this all out and I figured this is the best place to do it.

I've always had a little bit of health anxiety, but it typically subsided very quickly. It was never something that had an effect on my life until recently.

One night in early December I was playing a video game for several hours and barely moved. Eventually I had a pain shooting up my left leg and it appeared to be swollen. My mom suggested I pinched a nerve, but I just knew it was a blood clot. My symptoms were a mild pain in my leg and ""swelling"", Google told me I was about to die, and I was thoroughly convinced.

A few days pass of me obsessing over this. I read about DVT for hours every single day. I'm basically an expert on it at this point. I know all about taking blood thinners and the effect it could have on your period. I was preparing myself for this life.

I measured my legs to compare them many times a day. This had me believing the ""swelling"" wasn't going down. Turns out the left side of me is just fatter than the other half and I never noticed it because the difference is literally less than a cm. Was I *ever* swelling? No idea. My mom measured her own legs to show me a difference in the size of your legs was normal, which only kind of comforted me. Briefly wondered if she too was dying and didn't know it.

Somewhere around this time I thought I had sleep apnea because one night my anxiety was so bad that I was jolting awake every time I started dozing off. This fear faded pretty quickly since my obvious blood clot was my biggest priority.

After those few days passed, my anxiety finally won the battle, and I went to the ER. Shocking news: I did not have a blood clot in my leg. I thought this confirmation would make me feel better, and it did for a few days. But my (mild, barely noticeable) leg pain persisted and after all my DVT research I decided I was among the extremely rare few who had an inaccurate ultrasound reading.

6 days after the first ER visit, I had an excruciating muscle spasm in my leg. Surely the blood clot has moved up into my thigh, I thought. This was accompanied by my lower back feeling like it was on fire and the fiery pain radiating down into my leg. My mom once again suggested a pinched nerve. I was in hysterics at this point so I ignored her and went back to the ER.

They did another ultrasound. It was negative. I had sciatica. Started googling that to make sure it could cause the symptoms I had (it can). The pain was goddamn miserable, but I wasn't going to die.

You'd think at this point I'd be good, but my mind had other plans. I developed a cough. Welp, the blood clot was real and must have traveled to my lungs. I'm dealing with a pulmonary embolism now and death is imminent. I believed this for a few days before finally accepting that it was fucking ridiculous.

So after about 3 weeks of this hell I finally moved on from my blood clot obsession and just focused on healing the sciatica. Had a nice 2 weeks or so of feeling like I was back to normal mentally, until this week.

I had a pain in my lower abdomen. Convinced myself it was a kidney infection. Didn't start off assuming a mostly harmless UTI (or literally any of the many other things that could cause abdominal pain), nah, I went right for the hard hitter. This one could kill me, it's gotta be that one. I considered appendicitis too.

It was constipation.

I was hopeful that my life would go back to normal after the whole blood clot disaster, but now I'm worried that it was just the beginning. I *knew* I was being ridiculous when I diagnosed myself with a kidney infection, but there was still that voice in the back of my head saying ""but what if..."". I was still researching, still getting worked up about it. I don't want to be like this. It's humiliating and exhausting.",3.2679898857165597,5.268451885676743,4.6298142396368425,82.40585543344085,74.82128777923785,7.9235535380082025,27.03621630231355,8.710501217029153,2.1306721857205444,3059,118,590,63,66,1014,314,761,0.18600000000000005,0.731,0.083,-0.9982,2,0,1,1,0,1,96.0,0,3,2,9,33,40,6,4,50,0,76,45,24,7,10,94,116,36,5,15,18,3,5,3,0,4,20,2,0,0,56,24,0,1,19,7,0,15,10,22,3,6,59,7,88,18,81,41,15,112,1,1,0,1,19,41,2,9,59,431,144,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045583428542701386,0.0,0.0,0.037253978578612006,0.057444227834407814,0.1257253876835232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048768039573160615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21062180492795649,0.0457410992416003,0.06678980706634306,0.0,0.046615872586529536,0.12344223547109286,0.057490853948586274,0.048450669405995433,0.059808301467557515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11255343608834067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1749574742608055,0.0,0.0,0.24731126324204294,0.0564783520185653,0.0,0.055603084347346295,0.17056675790644196,0.11447210529888616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04955390761614848,0.09231323801615783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061645542952582434,0.0830990341046661,0.07827325790607546,0.0,0.18003465303975838,0.0,0.04659796652265365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05064553850558383,0.02862159519079792,0.0,0.12453662887503207,0.04594896187008312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04907435962914093,0.0,0.05622264976165512,0.058231235765189834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05441138343528986,0.107899454830676,0.0,0.0,0.06184277436220634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06060871955816596,0.057047543601942176,0.06021405863844224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1190426931040844,0.056018817887918036,0.11608349960369325,0.08029188700143383,0.05490645688892822,0.0,0.04848078860390222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1097032324488084,0.11108171311305268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055207875028329925,0.0,0.05531470827457586,0.19248180572386006,0.04372686885225839,0.17467538332407267,0.0,0.0,0.08450328248306116,0.0,0.0,0.102819330381679,0.1610256557504461,0.0,0.1247404787141672,0.0,0.058341574603015235,0.14848815915544455,0.04166455985142165,0.4080470972467964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05229609502840479,0.0,0.0,0.05723605264944308,0.0,0.1553615093342495,0.0,0.0,0.055733497174194034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959464986457053,0.062354478426685726,0.0350950722923397,0.0,0.054091109749598465,0.0,0.0,0.04678395568184529,0.0,0.04356524281631252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06188863179235896,0.0,0.045316650114813006,0.0,0.0548220632761058,0.0,0.0,0.04217424493831285,0.0,0.06132452365159734,0.11632600641267699,0.0,0.13124812581971718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10326371586989437,0.11387998670953288,0.04118962224109714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03639505877220988,0.035102413985858394,0.0,0.1304735572293661,0.0958323489146685,0.0,0.0,0.05234702641179337,0.0,0.0,0.05958762881973941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045201299795586194,0.06462427574278531,0.0,0.1318296512351196,0.0,0.0,0.1523517790543037,0.0,0.06116270486504113,0.0,0.0,0.05940928439559664,0.0398823124635356,0.05563428796574904,0.0,0.07783183244045222,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,srtv1,2019/01/06,"Head pulsing from medicine side effects. My suffering started when Doctor prescribed me clonazepam and Gabapentin. I took for just 2 weeks.Ever since I am suffering from lots of side effects. Well many have subsided or disappeared.

As of now I am suffering from head pulsing, tinnitus and lower back pain. 

I feel my head pulse over pillow. If I try to solve tough questions, my brain starts crashing.it goes black. I cannot explain what is going inside my head . I went to 13 different doctors in past 2 month( I thought I had some rare illness).  stopped going after I realised I suffer from medicine side effects.

healthanxiety,holycrapoctopus,2019/01/06,"Rabies HA is wrecking me Hey all. So I've been struggling with HA for years now but was really doing a lot better, almost 3 months with no major scares or full on panic attacks or anything. Then a couple days ago I got hit like a ton of bricks. I haven't been able to focus on or accomplish anything for days now and could really use some perspective.

About three months ago I was bitten on the leg by a small dog while out on a run. It was a small bite, barely broke the skin, and it turned out to be my neighbor's dog. She was very understanding and even emailed me the dog's vaccination records. I also checked in last week and the dog is still alive and well.

Despite this, I started getting symptoms the other day and I cannot. Stop. Freaking. Out. I keep convincing myself I'm getting pain or tingling near the bite site, plus I have all my usual anxiety symptoms again (nausea, insomnia, loss of appetite, brain fog) which are all signs of rabies onset. I've done all the research, I know there's basically no chance of getting rabies from an animal that's still alive weeks later but nothing will put my mind at ease. I can't shake the feeling that I should have gone to the doctor and gotten shots and now I'm going to die in agony for it. Has anyone else dealt with this? Is there anything I can do to navigate the anxiety surrounding this particularly horrifying disease?",3.760271720899027,5.5553461291512924,4.584570613887959,84.13352146930563,72.94833948339483,7.28889634350889,25.97131834954713,8.00094639256281,1.5518324723247234,1095,37,211,16,22,353,164,271,0.163,0.7,0.136,-0.8826,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,3,13,15,1,4,17,2,24,9,3,1,4,38,41,19,1,2,6,0,2,1,1,2,6,0,1,0,10,15,0,2,3,0,1,5,5,9,1,1,10,2,19,6,30,26,9,44,0,2,0,0,4,16,0,7,24,139,29,3,0.12509089756986433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2217710662856324,0.0,0.1252604645735022,0.0,0.0,0.100035145592524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1913883885042061,0.0,0.0,0.0874664640890874,0.12817040711868666,0.30881745079431433,0.0,0.0,0.14230895469403118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11063273349657868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13964281173162685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09987490297056166,0.13841069889415747,0.0,0.2420198412624154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12982460237177365,0.0,0.0,0.1280358342179366,0.0,0.12801141884596645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044973936062328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262135808454284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0632497163722503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19606449313156488,0.0,0.07109203980981964,0.0,0.10004661805758668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11118653733965657,0.0,0.0,0.06874668589480633,0.1019657771791338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0611130939673377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063478078210697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263061471391123,0.0,0.19969272200697924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12002808993844875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13310553457837904,0.1467672159586991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575090239545694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16027286423750126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12523781075095364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08853998113926638,0.0,0.19979550477158675,0.1045815915680191,0.0,0.1307721662857352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2600346780486515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360629758005268,0.0,0.1302240359376732,0.0,0.10803837219312974,0.13776995096431224,0.10321309107372698,0.0,0.0,0.20068074532783994,0.0,0.11247173972817252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08055443676881517
healthanxiety,cammmmmmmmmmmm,2019/01/07,Exhaustion Can health anxiety cause fatigue? My anxiety has been so bad lately and for the past weeks I’ve been exhausted. I’m just tired throughout majority of the day. I went to the doctor for continued back pain today (one reason for anxiety) and my x rays came back all clear but now with this fatigue I’m concerned that it’s a sign for some other illness. I’m only 19 and I’m so tired of all of this. ,0.9925301204819306,3.445451686746992,3.1433855421686765,87.3092951807229,86.34939759036146,6.693493975903616,22.757831325301204,7.908726449838941,1.4590250602409642,322,12,65,7,10,109,56,83,0.277,0.703,0.02,-0.9562,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,4,0,4,10,0,2,3,14,10,6,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,6,0,1,4,0,3,0,9,6,4,11,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,9,39,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4468136053661736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2994102933783976,0.16255861956057285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2226743182986884,0.0,0.20000100020201989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12555940850000633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19927420240448115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2069471319719937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21961961309793404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13192747099225166,0.14807106620398333,0.20716465355768926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18585432263714435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20017448658924006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4475366866008413,0.18454403864980454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15616915259470315,0.0,0.0,0.18048024862609707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,bulk_barn,2019/01/07,"Who else worries about other people too? Does anyone else worry about other people near them getting sick? I was visiting my parents over the holidays and I was worried about my mom. I don't think she goes to the doctor unless something is super wrong but I'm worried she has a brain tumor because she forgot some things I told her. She  is also a bit over weight and i was reading that women who are overweight have a higher risk of cancer.  I usually see her once a year since I live so far away and it feels like when I see her she is so much older... 

And this week I was worried I have colon cancer. I think it's because I ate a bunch of chick peas and so my stomach hurt. 

I can't stop my mind racing and thinking the worst.

healthanxiety,andrewonmiitomo,2019/01/07,"Trying to keep cool about my gastrointestinal symptoms Yesterday, I woke up with a dry mouth and dry throat. Nothing much. But today, I woke up with the same dry mouth, as well as the need to fart. When I got home, I had some stomach disturbances. It was cramping lightly and it made a lot of noise. I went to the bathroom and found out that I had diarrhea, since my poop is very... loose. Went somewhere after a while and then had to go to the bathroom because of my stomach discomfort. Another loose watery poop. As of this post, my throat is still dry (mouth is okay) regardless of the water I drank today. I took Pepto-Bismol, if that helps.

healthanxiety,averageplum,2019/01/07,"My generic eye pain is totally an eye-eating parasite, right? Woke up this morning around 4am to my eye burning like hell, my eye was pouring tears and super sensitive to light, my vision was blurred, and my eyelids felt like they were coated in glass.

I got pissed, thinking I maybe had pink eye. Waited until 8am to go in to the doctor. By the time I did this, all that was left was a vague shred of soreness and light sensitivity- no more redness or crying. Doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong.

Cue my anxiety.

She put me on antibiotic eye drops, and told me to go to an ophthalmologist if it gets worse. 

Fast forward to this evening. The burning is back. Not as bad as before, but it's dull and present.

And now, I'm freaking out. Hyperventilating, sobbing, posting to reddit. Sounds dumb, I know. But I'm fucking terrified. My vision is everything to me and eye problems freak me out more than anything in the entire world. I keep thinking back to some stupid show I saw where someone contracted acanthamoeba and I'm running through the symptoms non-stop. This guy got it by wearing contacts in the shower? SHIT! I did that three times last week! His eye felt like a foreign object was in it! OH FUCK! ME TOO!

I know that the symptoms for just about every eye problem include ""red, itchy, burning"" but I'm so fixated on this worst case scenario I'm making myself sick.

I'll take a thousand nightmares of pregnancy scares and infections that'll kill me over this one. It honestly feels like my life is ending, ha.

Anyway, I'm not claiming that I have this-- but I've mentally convinced myself that I do. Anyone able to talk some sense into me?

healthanxiety,TiAPiTA,2019/01/07,"My worry of the week... I’ve been experiencing pain in my left shoulder for about a week. I do have an old injury on it and I sleep on that side mainly. On Friday the pain was so bad it had me in the ER twice. The last time with a shot of Demerol and a heavy duty muscle relaxer.

I’ve been drugged up most of the weekend, and for the most part the intense pain is gone but what’s left is a weak arm and numbness in my elbow and most of the fingers on my left hand. I see my doc tomorrow.

It’s likely a pinched nerve or tendinitis. The ER doc said my muscles were tight and the pain was intense spasms (I’m talking worse than childbirth-I’ve had two kids). 

Of course MY brain goes to worst case scenario like cancer and my body is riddled with tumours. The last couple days I’ve had what I think is heartburn and intermittent chest pain, which just fuels my cancer worry. 

Seriously, it’s ridiculous. I’m trying to practice the CBT I’ve learned and steer my thoughts in another direction but it’s exhausting. I’m exhausted.

healthanxiety,EightSip,2019/01/07,"Anyone else have a 'weird feeling' on the left side of their body? Like a sort of 'fullness' or that something is wrong. I've pretty much experienced this since I was an adolescent (I'm 21 now.) So basically, on the left side of my body, specifically the left breast, there is sometimes a benign feeling of 'fullness' and less commonly a dull sort of pain. It doesn't really radiate. Sometimes when it happens and flares up, I feel it the most when I breathe deeply in and out. I do have precordial catch syndrome (which is harmless), but I don't think that's what this is. I'm always convincing myself that it's angina and that I might have a heart attack, but then I remember I've had this feeling for *so long* in my life that I probably should have gotten one by now. Even when I was young, I had an EKG done and everything came back just fine, and a cardiologist I saw was totally convinced that nothing is wrong with me and just sent me on my way. I'm so sick of having this feeling and I don't know what to think of it. And just recently, I've started to have weird sensations on the left side of my left hand, and sometimes below my left breast. There is also a point in my left breast that when I touch and rub, it actually hurts. I'm thinking this may be a muscle strain or tear, but those things don't really last for several years, no?

To note: this feeling isn't constant, it comes and goes. Even when I forget about it, bam, it just comes out of nowhere.

I have no other symptoms. Zero breathing problems, no heartburn etc.",4.36305230288837,5.2958790163934415,5.046744730679158,84.74841530054645,70.31147540983606,8.301327088212334,28.294301327088213,8.563005593585519,1.8859383294301333,1200,42,248,19,21,387,150,305,0.14,0.773,0.08800000000000001,-0.9601,0,0,1,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,1,0,21,16,1,1,15,0,29,14,9,0,1,47,51,27,0,2,9,0,9,1,0,3,5,0,0,0,28,18,0,0,11,0,0,5,8,10,0,2,10,11,25,6,28,37,7,47,0,2,1,3,2,24,0,7,18,175,53,0,0.0,0.0,0.08575928882242345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07027849393641711,0.07312412563071878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06144851721577504,0.09004458509222088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0999774524275772,0.0,0.06757515095510143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19523220927529908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10051258093415856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1514035938311862,0.0,0.09496826230334003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899328897845953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07341339285735854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09801067078938544,0.1160892919937337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0789818773314609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26661198615056503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07771297757485138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10413954147428996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940785485594128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04829716115460913,0.07163483604447671,0.0,0.0,0.6683816012726371,0.0,0.062073028730328626,0.04293427253371447,0.0,0.0,0.07777201912811563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932279726529605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460272943696647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08432429763534435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0595505162286407,0.0,0.09351169980672534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08307605702288172,0.0,0.0,0.08940668526912766,0.0947507030201153,0.08409035608382623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259778201721553,0.0,0.08677199656294719,0.0,0.09955216909284016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09928064279013876,0.0,0.07269616441981071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06765517390515992,0.26075000220712913,0.0,0.062202703767459136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0913421249914494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05838430620687905,0.16893200526846272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06975593659400282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19216840147788208,0.0,0.056592555171247325
healthanxiety,mharris2317,2019/01/07,"Why do I keep creating problems in my head to get freaked out about? I've had this IRRATIONAL, above and beyond fear of skin cancer for like a year and a half now. I've had several moles, from the littlest freckle to big moles I've always had, that I obsess and get super paranoid about. I'm on mole #8 to freak out about. Part of this is because I still get a small mole/freckle (I'm 23) and I get super paranoid about getting a new one even though my derm tells me that this is normal. I just went to my derm about 3 weeks ago for my annual, there was a spot on my shoulder I was freaked about, ended being a black head, she checked all my other moles and said all was good. NOW, I'm onto two other spots that I am irrationally losing my mind about. I'm going to see my therapist a week from today so hopefully it will help. I just don't want to deal with this anymore. I'm terrified of everything.

healthanxiety,mrmake_it_rain,2019/01/07,"Heart problems please help 😔 So iv been having on and off trouble breathing and a racing heart/palpitations for about a month now. I was supposed to have a blood test but I had a panic attack but I had an ECG done and have heard nothing back so I'm guessing it came back OK? 

I'm still getting random palpitations and a racing heart that seems to come and go and I'm so terrified I have something seriously wrong with me. They can come and go at any time of the day at random I'm so scared but apparently ECGs can pick up all sorts of problems?

Anyone experience symptoms like these for this long?

healthanxiety,FluffiMuffin,2019/01/07,"THIS is why I hate doctors... I’ve found there are two different types of health anxiety. 1. You seek out medical advice for any and all issues or 2. You avoid doctors and tests like the plague because you’re scared of bad results. 

I am #2. 7 years ago, when I was 22, I had an OBGYN who badly needed clients bring me in 4x in a month unnecessarily to test me for slightly “abnormal” results on various things. She told me I could have everything from kidney failure to cervical cancer and kept running test after test. 

Every visit she thought I was something else. I had no symptoms - this all started with amy first annual exam with her. I freaked out so bad that my parents were concerned about my mental well-being. 

I went to my family GP back home, who talked me off a cliff and re-tested me for everything. I was fine. 

Fast forward 7 years. I’m now pregnant. I haven’t been to an OBGYN since that first doctor and am terrified. I was recommended a new OBGYN who was supposed to be really great. I go. I submit routine bloodwork, which was super scary for me due to previous experience. 

I get a call from new OBGYN telling me I tested positive for Hepatitis C, that it is chronic and incurable, and questioned about IV drug use. I run back in for follow up tests to tell me “how bad I have it.”

Follow up tests show that I do not in fact have Hepatitis C at all. Doctor had failed to tell me the false positive rate is up to 50%. (Oh, and per other doctors, it is curable if I even did have it. There are commercials on TV about said cure for crying out loud!)

Y’all, I can’t take this s*** anymore. I face my worst fear that I have a serious medical condition I’m unaware of, then I’m told they’ve found an underlying condition that could kill me, and then they TAKE IT ALL BACK.

I trust one doctor, and one doctor only. That’s my GP and God help me when he retires. :*(",1.8254282489064515,4.089562924932977,3.644592211090728,86.41567341611403,80.60857908847186,6.8217581487230134,24.024904755185556,7.94452939551167,1.4498997319034856,1453,53,292,27,38,487,205,373,0.168,0.7559999999999999,0.075,-0.9881,2,1,2,0,0,1,56.0,0,3,1,4,14,18,2,3,10,0,31,17,2,4,5,37,53,19,1,4,3,1,0,1,0,0,15,2,1,0,21,16,0,2,4,2,0,9,4,13,0,5,20,2,47,5,42,30,6,45,0,1,0,0,23,16,0,3,23,190,68,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08159629578700636,0.07401867543631878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05678360251748954,0.0,0.06387810298358422,0.0,0.08281064086810996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926215450085368,0.2788796791265933,0.05090148759107839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08526394578299389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13333764680899254,0.0,0.0917220231333963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08724086358878154,0.0,0.5982683053426633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09683475105076836,0.0,0.06975444354241354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055151680429683235,0.0,0.07035326714904674,0.0,0.15009078558447247,0.08168008566422241,0.0787173933938878,0.09396193753125544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420519638492922,0.0,0.18310926387066767,0.0,0.0,0.043625871564328136,0.0,0.047455592011371464,0.0,0.0,0.09206024317500874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244003610468371,0.0,0.0887577507678901,0.0,0.0,0.05596901847217663,0.0,0.08375839849871479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871534405387489,0.0,0.0,0.0923815810228856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04079441329331498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682371207354587,0.08414945600585359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06664977097685182,0.0,0.0,0.06191499795375889,0.0,0.16129174025791734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11316499511916875,0.06350633934780736,0.0,0.0,0.09271807539866476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09354032753383976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053492934483912666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794286552700314,0.0,0.0835991549446819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06907296202239781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06428321624760075,0.0,0.0,0.05910249913885834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08678960136251886,0.12556485113387578,0.06711501074579339,0.2189508914274234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055474411855391016,0.0,0.0,0.06629053589646855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595777339307499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08156842879239365,0.0,0.0,0.07211812920385062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07507750526820696,0.07740634418770212,0.07534674323196416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10754392464284562
healthanxiety,hippydippy_christian,2019/01/07,"Weird rash Ugh. I've been really good about my health anxiety lately, but now I get random rashes. I showed my doctor pictures of them last month, and he said they were vascular rashes, and to just call and make an appointment if they happen again. I made an appointment for today, but I'm nervous. They're such weird rashes. I thought they were something with my cycle because the last two times I got them, it was while I was on my period. But I got it again today, and I'm not on my period, so idk what's going on. I went to the allergist a few months ago and don't have food or environmental allergies, so idk what else there is.

healthanxiety,Kkm13,2019/01/08,"Piece of advice, take it how you will. Been suffering bad HA for almost 2 years now, (couldn’t go get my haircut, go out to eat with friends) but recently it seems to be getting better, I’m not even sure if it’s actually getting better, but I’m living with it better.  


And that’s the 1 piece of advice i wanted to try and give you guys, instead of trying to end the anxiety/panic just let it happen (way easier said than done, takes awhile to learn how) but once i stopped getting angry at the anxiety and just allowed it to happen i swear it got better. I can go out with friends now and i know the anxiety and panic won’t kill me, it’s such a freeing feeling. Trust me i know what you’re going through and it DOES get better.

healthanxiety,kate3141,2019/01/08,"Worried about Fitbit resting rate So I have been doing really well and going to the gym most days of the week and doing cardio since the week before the New Year. That’s all great, except Fitbit is giving me resting heart rates that are really low compared to what I’m used to. Like, I had been 64-65 and now it’s telling me 59! It’s been steadily dropping since I started exercising, can exercise change your resting heart rate that much that fast? Any insight appreciated!

I was lying on my bed trying to sleep and then sat down to measure it and it gave me readings as high as 107 bpm and as low as 91.

Sometimes when I get a sudden, brief twinge of pain, it feels like my consciousness shifts. Not like I'm dizzy or faint or anything, but sort of like my train of thought just stops and my attention is immediately focused. It's almost a ""woosh"" feeling. It doesn't happen every time I feel pain, just sometimes.

Is this normal? Weird? Maybe related to blood pressure?

healthanxiety,wilxor,2019/01/08,"Dealing with it I have been dealing with HA for the past 2-years. It is nice to realize I am not alone in my struggles. 

Currently have a rough bout with getting over the thought that I may have lung cancer. I am a non-smoker but I constantly am checking my phlegm to see if there is a little bit of blood. I do find very little bits some time but I am sure this is because of my obsessive checking.  Been to doctor and had an x-ray but these always seem like bandaids as the feeling comes back after weeks. 

I have been to a therapist and tried doing CBT but I find that my HA can quickly snowball if I do not nip it in the bud early on. Kind of where I feel I am at right now. 

It’s hard on my family and wife. She can tell when I am obsessing and if I talk to her she gets frustrated. Can’t say I blame her I am pretty frustrated with myself. 

Don’t know what I am expecting from this post but it’s nice to be able to just put down some thoughts some where and get them off my chest. I do wonder if my experience echos those of others here, feel free to message me if you would like to chat.

healthanxiety,TheSockofdoom,2019/01/08,"I had no idea so many people were like me. Ever since I was 15-16 I had panic attacks from thinking I was having a stroke or heart attacks or cancer etc. First was walking home from school started feeling very thirsty and hot then dizzy called 911 thinking I was dying/ having a heat stroke. Doc told me I had a panic attack. Now I'm 25 and been in and out of work due to my panic attacks or just the anxiety of having panic attacks. Im super depressed and have no drive to be the best me anymore. I feel stuck and like I'll never get better. Pot works wonders but unfortunately I don't live in a legal state. And since I'm looking for a job I can't use it I have to rely on my clonopin which only helps if I catch the panic attack in time. I get pains or find something wrong on my body and assume the worst instantly and go full panic mode. Fucking sucks. It's ruined my life, all I do now is put in job applications and play BFV to keep my mind off my body. Last income I've had was from a guy I used to work concrete construction with who hires me as a ranch hand ever so often but only for about a week a year. My father supports me but I hate relying on him because he barely makes any money doing what he does and we are always short on food because rent and utilities come first. I hate doing this to him. I'm fucking 25 I should be out doing my own think not seizuring out thinking I'm dying 2-4 times a week.

healthanxiety,tumsa,2019/01/08,"I think my HA is back I was doing well with my HA for the past year.

From my post history, you can see I had a small episode in December, I had a loss of feeling in my foot that lasted almost all month but I managed to stay chill (my friends freaked out more than I did, and that made me question if I am too chill, but overall I had no panic attacks or sleepless nights or anything). I went to a doctor after it lasted over 10 days and was sure it's just my back. I was prescribed some medicine for two weeks and got better, can feel my leg again. My doctor did schedule MRI for my back just to check why it happened, and since I have a sedentary job and have had minor back pain here and there, I was happy with that. MRI is next week. 

Now, this will get graphic. What is freaking me out right now is my bowel movements. I noticed that my BMs are a bit weird in August, I would get more constipated from time to time, feeling an incomplete evacuation from time to time, and I started to need to go more frequent (sometimes up to 4-5 times per day, usually I'd go 1-2 times per day). Since I was on my ""let's beat HA"" kick, I wrote it off to ""probably not eating as well as I should"" or ""maybe it's stress"". I had no pain or other issues and I had good BMs as well. 

Those symptoms did not go away, I got used to needing to go more often, got used to mild constipation mixed with occasional diarrhea but a month ago I noticed that I often would feel like I need to go but all that would come out would be a few thin pieces. And 10-15 minutes later I would feel like I need to go again. Then every 3-4 days I will get one somewhat bigger, normal-ish BM and would feel better (empty) for one day, then the cycle starts again. So for the last few months, and especially last month, I've had the following symptoms:

\- Change in the character or frequency of bowel movements

\- Thin, ribbon-like stools 

\- A sensation of incomplete evacuation after a bowel movement (almost all the time now),  persistent urge to have a bowel movement (also almost all the time)

\- Feeling back pain (could be unrelated, but it is low back pain)

\- Lately, lots of mucus

\- Lots of gas

\- Occasional rectal pain 

\- Very occasional blood (maybe once per two weeks or less)

My diet hasn't changed, I eat plenty of fiber, I don't eat meat or dairy. I know that as a 29-year-old, I should not be worried about colon cancer. I know my HA probably has made it something it's not. But I think what is freaking me out is not having a ""positive story"" for this. Like for my leg, I could tell myself ""it might be sciatic nerve, chill"", when my chest hurts, I know ""it's probably GERD"" etc. But I don't have a non-threatening explanation for these symptoms so I can feel my HA levels rising. Part of me is still clinging to ""this might be something else, you're fine"" but part of is ""you know what these symptoms mean, don't you"". 

I know that these symptoms are enough to go to a doctor, especially based on how long they have been there. Actually, I might have been stupid by not going to a doctor sooner. But I already have back MRI scheduled and I've been through so many bouts of HA, I know that as soon as my doctor will say something like ""let's get a colonoscopy"", I won't be able to sleep or eat at all. 

I don't really know what's the point of this post, since nobody can tell me what's wrong or what this could be, we're not doctors here and I should talk to mine. I guess I just needed to let it all out and know I am not alone and it fucking sucks to get HA back after a year of normal living. :(

Today, it’s been getting really bad for 10 seconds, and then it fades away. Could it be an aneurysm?

About two weeks ago in central Alberta we were cleaning out a rental. I was sick already so just simply crashed on the mattress in the basement with the lights on.

Last week I seem to have gotten over the initial flue but have started to have headaches, vomiting etc. Sore muscles in my legs and lower back and one hell of a cough. Nothing coming up with the cough and no runny nose or anything. I feel very tired all the time, and it seems to be getting worse.

Its likely that its just a flu coming back, but am starting to get someone nervous it could be hantaviruous.",4.271317600786631,6.09056808849558,4.134985250737465,87.7796066863324,71.65486725663717,6.084169124877089,29.369714847590966,6.42735559955562,1.4011915437561455,466,19,87,3,9,142,84,113,0.246,0.754,0.0,-0.986,2,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,1,0,0,0,6,3,1,1,9,0,9,9,2,0,1,20,19,8,0,1,5,0,1,1,0,0,7,0,2,0,5,10,0,0,3,0,0,2,1,2,0,2,3,3,5,1,16,13,2,19,1,0,0,0,2,8,1,3,10,61,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17229179522492774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21448530359874068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15994485931003594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2989075535589864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3348544338597726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15518369117232628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2167670320691956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098276185110704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2030941430865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15843245104905807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09495634257194767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864973230212059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317059515775594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3538830357264864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16468383016333352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2751434180330445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113335103867383,0.22339261387832424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18986520560488865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16037050323690902,0.0,0.0,0.3118138579455447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19807333298939747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,StephanieW221,2019/01/08,"Hi I’m new - hypochondriac for 3 years. Hi everyone I’m 22 years old and have had bad health anxiety for years followed by depression.

It’s always something new each week, though the symptoms feels very much real and I am convinced there is something going on but I’m not sure what exactly.
I’ve had blood tests which show severe anaemia and low vit D.
These are my main health anxiety I experience a lot -

• Lymph nodes felt easily everywhere! For 2 years. Main one I worry about is below my right collarbone which is easily felt but moves very freely to the top of my collarbone. (Could probably feel 20 of them)
• Numb body parts that wake me up all the time - Neuropathy issues.
• Obsessed with not having thin stool/blood in stools.
• Pelvic Floor Tension.
• Spider veins
• Recurrent UTIs
• Random muscle aches.
• Specks in vision. (Vision getting worse fast)
• When I get the flu, it’s not a normal “flu” I’m in and out of hospital last time and my immune system catch’s other viruses leaving my feeling like death for over a month (last time my whole right side of body was numb/weak)

Yeah my life has sucked the last 3-4 years. I’m also scared that there’s something really wrong with me.
I’m obsessed with googling every symptom - linking them all up together. I would try to find reassurance.. I would find an article to reassure me, then leave several pages open to just go back to them when I’m anxious again. I’d search and search til I’m on multiple pages of google.
I have so much medication that doctors throw at me it’s not even funny.

Thank you all for reading I’m happy I found this group.

healthanxiety,HoohaThrowaway1,2019/01/08,"I dont know how to live with this It's funny. All of my anxiety centers around my health and possible death and the constant, aching want, to just live. But because I am do anxious all the time, I'm not living. Not really.

It's been a bad few weeks. I move from the bed to the couch, doing nothing but laying down. I feel hopeless and scared and so sure something is wrong with me that I'm making myself sick. I am so petrified of being sick and dying that its robbing me of my life.

I'm so scared of not being there for my kids, but I've been so exhausted and scared that I haven't even been angle to properly make them dinners.

I dont know how to live with this. I dont know how to live with the constant fear that something is wrong. That something is going to rob me of my life...but that's exactly what anxiety abd depression are doing for me now.

I feel so hopeless. And helpless. And so  so tired.

healthanxiety,HariSeldonsFuture,2019/01/08,"Beginning a week of no “Googling” today! Anyone want to join? Title pretty much sums it up.

After reading some inspirational posts on here from people who conquered their battles with HA, I noticed one of the biggest things they said helped was to stop googling symptoms. So, I’m starting small. One week of no googling.

I’ve already had the urge about 5 times since I woke up 3 hours ago, lol, but I’m fighting through it. I will be updating this post everyday to say whether I succeeded or not for that given day to keep myself honest. 

I would absolutely LOVE if people on this sub would join me in this “challenge”. If you feel comfortable joining and commenting below that you are doing so, that would be amazing! I think having a sense of community and camaraderie is extremely important.

I hope this post isn’t breaking any rules! If so, I apologize and will edit accordingly.",5.095120339782916,7.126440852760742,5.371165644171783,78.886375648891,69.920245398773,8.450967437470505,32.17036337895234,9.057496981413335,2.982166965549788,701,32,122,14,13,222,116,163,0.053,0.6759999999999999,0.271,0.9916,0,0,0,0,2,0,19.0,0,2,2,3,5,11,2,0,4,2,14,2,0,0,0,22,27,12,0,8,7,0,1,0,0,5,1,2,0,0,11,4,0,2,3,1,0,0,4,2,0,2,5,3,14,9,20,15,2,25,0,0,0,1,12,8,0,6,13,83,25,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14460337217233032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18001610663638012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109328201257337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11406308199809992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10520424136868772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824825567154103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10934144336607572,0.0,0.0,0.16202318360929874,0.16064849005507306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14499590509044402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14722963610381126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11991805106044218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1857226209865957,0.0,0.0,0.221079880309068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22618521064655095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4686953805891293,0.16596010017981028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1631724186789143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15517234443139474,0.12972615085601866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13494139385084328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11546303184855007,0.0,0.0,0.13638254134024205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1695527372319683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837517661968574,0.10452601105289383,0.0,0.0,0.09512140832550647,0.0,0.1546265295226004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09621728242531938,0.0,0.2617033230753989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3476449360953577,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,axolotlluvr,2019/01/08,"HA Person's Worst Nightmare, But I'm Coping A little about me: I'm vegan, fit, try to avoid processed foods, chemicals, only have monogamous relationships, never had a 1 night stand, etc. I have had health anxiety since I was 19 when I worked in an ER and saw all the terrible things that happen to people. 

So this past weekend I went to a college reunion with people I hadn't seen in 7 years. We went out one night and a friend asked if I smoked, I said no. He handed me his vape and said try this. I did, and hit it a few more times through out the night. 

Well at the end of the reunion weekend he revealed to a friend that he had been HIV+ for several years and currently has his virus controlled and undetectable. 

But needless to say it was a very stressful drive home. I had one of the worst HA freak outs I have had in years and didn't eat for 48 hours I was so nervous. I could hardly get out of bed!

Thankfully, I have been reassured that HIV is not passed via saliva -- even though I've what if'ed the hell out of the situation. Of course I will still test to confirm, but I learned so much about HIV in particular through this experience, which has helped mitigate my anxiety.

healthanxiety,LonelySwinger,2019/01/08,Do any of you think that your health anxiety is a form of PTSD that occurred after witnessing something happen in your life? I know mine has a lot to do with my dog having a stroke in the middle of the night when I was younger. Had to put her down that morning and the image of her near the bed and how her body was sure as hell scared me.

healthanxiety,Ihatethingslikeme,2019/01/08,"Im scared im dying, help So, 5-4 days ago i found a lump on my head, as a lot of people in this subreddit do, i searched up about it on Google, i checked every brain cancer that appeared and none were similar to mine.

then i found symptoms for just overall brain cancer, and right in that evening i started feeling off balance(more like dizzy, light headed, i still walk very well, just don't feel good), i wake up shaking as if im cold, and when i eat, my stomach dies.

honestly, most things i found about people with the same problem(lump), they are fine.

but, I don't know, i had a similar problem with a pain in my chest, I thought that i was having an heart attack, because, again, google and it was just an infection in my  lung(the doctor also gave me antibiotics)

i don't know, i think it's just the ""what if"", i still think im going to die.
like, i wouldn't care as much if i was 50, 60, 70 years old, but im fucking 13, and my life was getting better, now i don't even want to go to school.

My wife was getting video games out of our closet and sniffed them because she thought they smelled of urine (wanted to make sure the cats didn’t pee on them) she then realized there were mouse turds in the box that the games were in. We are afraid that she has possibly inhaled the hantavirus when she did this. What is the likelihood? Should we be concerned and seek medical help as soon as possible?

healthanxiety,kaybeeds,2019/01/09,"I got an aneurysm and i'm still alive I feel the need to add a trigger warning to this post. As someone who suffers from HA, I know this post can be scary but if I can be positive about it, you all can! I was diagnosed with brain aneurysm and artery dissections when I was 22, which put me at stroke risk until I was fully healed (which I am now). I will post the full story in the comments.

It seems that for some of you on here, that is literally your worst fear, I'm here to tell you that even if it does happen, an aneurysm or even a stroke is not a death sentence. In fact, I was healed (with no surgery) within 3 months.  The aneurysm had been there for at least 2 months before that and I had no idea, AND I STILL LIVED! The most debilitating part of this? The HA I got from it. It was the darkest 6 months of my life. I was in constant fear of having a stroke despite the blood thinners I was on. I never wanted to be alone anywhere and only felt truly safe with my parents. I had panic attacks all the time. But slowly, I gained more confidence in the functioning abilities of my body. I can honestly say that the HA affected me way more than the neurological symptoms did. So give your bodies more credit and your anxious brains less credit! 

If I can survive an aneurysm and torn artery and only have bits of HA after 2 years, so can you!!

healthanxiety,bells8855,2019/01/09,"Being persistent with doctors or accepting the 'health anxiety' label and just accepting it? Whats your opinion. So to start off i'm a binge drug user so i occasionally binge on most things meth cocaine heroin etc, so i recently developed health anxiety(apparently) along with lots of pricks and pains in my hands feet eyes pretty much anywhere really nothing chronic but enough to make me panic, so i'm wondering should i persist with doctors to fix this, or just deal with it. I'm so fed up with being afraid once i sat in the hospital emergency room parking lot snorting cocaine waiting for my heart to mess up so they could figure out the problem and fix it(I know that is dumb lol). Just getting desperate and annoyed. Also along with health anxiety my drug use now is almost 0 due to the fear, maybe  a good thing?

healthanxiety,k04li,2019/01/09,"3 month old corn dog I posted this in r/foodpoisoning but I doubt I'd get any help there. I'm about to have a panic attack over this crap.
I sat down to eat a corn dog. The first bite tasted a little unusual. I brushed it off and ate half the corn dog, when I checked the expiration date. November 2018. The corn dog looked fine other than thick grease coming out of it. Anyway, I have a fear of getting food poisoning, but I'm afraid I'm going to start throwing up later. Anyone know if I should worry about this or you think I'll be fine?",1.2542397425583296,3.2253658318584084,2.9314078841512483,92.3426950925181,80.94690265486727,5.879002413515687,18.237329042638773,6.980632752743323,0.011626548672566628,421,9,94,5,11,139,78,113,0.235,0.6990000000000001,0.065,-0.974,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,1,0,1,5,9,3,4,8,0,4,6,1,0,0,11,17,6,0,2,4,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,3,4,0,2,0,1,3,0,7,0,2,2,5,8,2,14,13,0,19,0,0,1,0,2,8,1,3,7,50,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1633197921917082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16792829054161976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732212824585306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20688006680982807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2457477841063861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702513301583557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2042834215136738,0.2904073272152908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2509516114576813,0.0,0.1364907663835614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16097690285209276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13198788316123142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2407074753146229,0.0,0.0,0.20167731836818395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916966564812738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2520117745692164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28178077095232695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23001077610836865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16998935342990826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538874283051488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2438982545213648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,FawnRoyale,2019/01/09,"I’m not super paranoid, but could I be pregnant? So - let me preface this with saying I AM on the pill. I’m too paranoid not to use it, and take it faithfully. Haven’t taken it late since week 1 and it’s currently week 3. It’s the combo pill.
Secondly, why this gives me anxiety - I’m NOT ready to be pregnant. It’s not the right time for me.

So basically my boyfriend and I did the deed (today) with a condom, but it broke. I’ve been having PMS cramps since around Monday, and my period is due in exactly a week.

healthanxiety,poaldianu,2019/01/09,"Tinnitus thinking, panic attacks. Please help me. I recently came across a video about people ""curing"" their tinnitus temporarily. I had no idea what tinnitus was so I decided to google it. Turns out that I might actually have it myself. I hear a faint high frequency sound everytime I cover my ears with my hands and during complete silence. I always thought it was normal to hear this at times when nothing can be heard. I've had a panic attack since noticing it and noticing that it can't be cured. 

I'm still wondering if I have this and if my head is just making this up.. since I've never ever noticed this before. But I can't stop thinking about it and covering my ears to hear if its still there. I'm terrified and shaking.

I'm so afraid that I will never be able to not hear this sound now when completely silent. I'm sure that I've had this all my life if I do have this.. but I still wish that I never discovered this disease. Help me, what should I do??

healthanxiety,DukeMcFister,2019/01/09,"Can anxiety give the sensation of food particles sticking in the throat? Over the past week and a half I've been tortured with anxiety of having a tumor in my esophagus. I've had a feeling of a lump in the left side of  my throat and it feels like little bits of food (chips, breadcrumbs) are sticking in my throat. Initially this fear came from me overthinking symptoms of something else, and now it feels like there's really something in there. I've seen an ENT and he wants to give me antacids for GERD for a week and see if it makes a difference, couldn't be convinced to give me an endoscopy since I'm young (20) and have obvious symptoms of anxiety, I believe. Could my anxiety just be making me hypersensitive to the swallowing process?",8.382082494969817,7.295257147887328,7.943963782696179,74.23936619718309,62.02816901408451,12.0579476861167,39.29979879275653,11.20814326018867,4.311489738430583,593,27,112,14,7,188,83,142,0.135,0.82,0.045,-0.8972,0,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,1,13,0,10,10,3,2,1,19,23,7,0,4,2,0,3,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,8,3,0,3,0,0,1,1,2,0,1,4,5,9,3,20,15,1,15,0,0,2,0,4,9,0,1,7,68,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4224157351548853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15552927576849446,0.0,0.0,0.15070922487257274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15788653490167595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11021758135788233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442274887917094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11531876015815913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15533883703873727,0.2093988745754155,0.19723853943042535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3338487655229513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3972756019159496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14998613540456393,0.0,0.0,0.13488348335842335,0.13835720719670255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842920210370676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13177943115252225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843506690947367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000387416477934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11419212793277085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125473423680803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2869629149191333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08142243021589296,0.0,0.22146250676860385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,aannb,2019/01/10,"IBS and Other GI Issues...Anyone Else? It's so crazy to me, kind of comforting, that there are 10.8 thousand subscribers. I feel slightly better knowing I'm not alone. 

So onto the issue at hand. I was diagnosed with IBS four years ago. Ever since I have had different episodes of constipation and diarrhea and like such intense gas discomfort that I could feel the spasms in my intestines. I've had an ultrasound to give me peace of mind that my abdomen is clear of anything sketchy. 

About a week ago I had an outpatient procedure done and needed to take a high dose of antibiotics. 1000mg of aziththromycin. Well, I have been so constipated and I mean my water intake hasn't been the best, I have been super stressed out, anxious, overwhelmed, my diet hasn't been great...it's been mostly in n out, pizza, etc...and yesterday I started feeling this weird pressure/uncomfortable pain in my actual butt. Like the same muscles I use to pee operates that back there too I think and it feels just not great when I pee or sit down too hard, etc. Has anyone ever felt this way? I've been able to pass a little bit of poo but not much. Really trying to talk myself off the anxiety ledge thinking of bowel cancer, or if the fibroid I just found out about 5 days ago might have super grown and impacted my colon...I am a straight mess guys. Any input would be great.

healthanxiety,xkarpii,2019/01/10,"Does this just sound like anxiety/depression? Hey! I know you guys arent doctors, and I am waiting for a call back from psychiatrists, but I was wondering if any of you guys have had similar symptoms and could give me some insight.

I feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I just get these episode where everything gets ""scary."" I just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy. My life feels almost like a horror movie during these times. Usually a small sound (such as my fridge, PC, anything really) will seem to grow louder and seem eerie/spooky. My thoughts go down this loop of ""Do I have some sort of serious chronic mental illness, will I feel this way forever, will it get worse?"" And of course I try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can, but the feelings are still there and very real. Sometimes I get very weird (and super brief) thoughts of doing rash things (flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example). It feels like there's an anchor in my stomach and sometimes, but not usually, Ill get shaky and have heart palpitations. These episodes last for well over 15 minutes and I never feel normal afterwards so I get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks, because they way other people describe there's, I feel as though mine are a lot different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to add, is over the summer I did acid for the first time, and I always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. So I often fear that I did acid and fucked myself over because of it, but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone could give me some insight, or share what their crippling anxiety feels like I would love to hear it.

healthanxiety,Crimsonmoon99000,2019/01/10,"Anyone else always seem to see news articles on what your scared of? I have only been up an hour and so far on Facebook I have seen two news articles on brain cancer. One titled “girl diagnosed with terminal brain cancel after routine eye exam” which is absolutely my worst fear so now I’m convinced it will happen to me. A lot of my anxiety is centred around brain tumours especially around symptoms with my eyes. 

And then a few weeks ago I also kept get recommended on my YouTube “girl plays guitar during brain surgery” then a week later the same thing but with a guy. How do you not see this as “signs” that you have that too? One article has literally ruined my whole day now.",3.90385843164469,5.907437290076338,4.817904233171408,81.73200555170023,73.04580152671755,7.81707147814018,25.64954892435809,8.575989854853784,1.8542916030534355,539,18,101,10,11,175,96,131,0.126,0.838,0.036000000000000004,-0.9011,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,3,0,0,9,6,0,2,6,0,9,9,6,1,0,17,17,10,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,3,7,7,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,4,0,3,3,5,12,2,16,13,5,19,0,1,5,0,6,8,0,2,11,71,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12852189974494976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11594575584765315,0.1206404910245104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109143753135241,0.0,0.0,0.101378022994438,0.14855593644268314,0.0,0.2581376797884973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6474121173718776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09350438208188074,0.0,0.0,0.14715837778321691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12111772531563005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16315026774050898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07574953021552593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1435595587365054,0.1282111983253355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14278262548697604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12326244828773858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1964933859138897,0.11026886567093072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14515691002612846,0.0,0.23107114569167886,0.13199038288416856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506966232436076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09632267474203267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416308703960572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325990586936848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16187239492952127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,sleepybugeyes,2019/01/11,"flu season destroys me Hey everyone,

I have been a lurker for a while on this subreddit but I struggle so badly with HA, 

flu season is what does me in, I have emetephobia as well but flu season makes me agoraphobic at times.

Every single winter for the last three years I am burning my hands with sanitizer and if I hear I was near someone with the flu I will nearly throw up from a panic attack and sometimes panic so hard I am sweating and coming down with flu symptoms just from anxiety alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not understand why my fear of the flu is so intense, I have no idea how to make it less intense, and last years flu season was so scary I feel like I will never recover from the fear.

I was at the doctor today for a cough that won't quit and a sinus infection and somebody with the flu who tested positive was there....I am now nauseous with the thought i may get it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know we all struggle so badly, but does anybody have any tips for dealing with severe anxiety the flu?

I am terrified I will get it and die, and if I get it I will panic about dying the entire time and make it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

healthanxiety,DishsoapHandsoap,2019/01/11,"I'm spiraling right now. What do you guys do. How do you cope with it. Just need a shoulder to lean on, and a friend to talk to. Recently just moved to a new city for a new job, and I am all by myself in my apartment.  I don't have furniture yet and I am still sleeping in an air mattress right before I moved I had a muscle strain and the doctor prescribed me a short dose of prednisone.  I started to get real bad side effects at the end of the course and my blood pressure is shot up.  Went to the ER and was told not stress out and that it was just anxiety and the drug clearing my system.  My intial BP when they took it was 180/97 and thenback secs later dropped to 163/93I was thirsty and urinating all the time. I was convinced I had diabetes and high blood pressure.  All while moving to a new city &amp; new job.  Then began experiencing really bad heart issues coupled high blood pressure.  Tried to just relax but still stressing.  Then yesterday had a blood in my nose all day which freaked me out so much.  I stupidly kept picking at it with my finger to check throughout the day.  It never ended, had blood in my nose from 8am to 5pm was freaked out went to the ER doctor prescribes me a bunch of antibiotics and steroids.  Looking back I am in shock on how I just kept sticking my finger in my nose because I was so anxious.  Now I am hardcore stressing over catching MRSA or staph because didn't wash my hands before and was in the hospital.  Then today, spit up blood that lasted for about 30 mins.  Thought I was dying.  Called 911 Em's came and they were not to concerned looking at the amount of blood the fact that I was being treated for blood in nose.

Every once in a while, I will go through a period where I just think almost constantly about it. The reason why I’m afraid of ALS is because it’s so terrible and as a white male who is decently athletic, I am technically considered more at risk than other demographics.

A long time ago, a psychiatrist told me to read a book called Hope and Help for Your Nerves by Claire Weekes. I did not read it back then, but just recently picked it up. It's an old Australian book (first published in 1969) but it has been EXTREMELY helpful for me. I'm also on medication, and I can't recommend antidepressants for HA enough, but give this book a try. It's only 8 bucks on Amazon, so it's not a huge investment. I hope this post helps someone out there!

healthanxiety,wildpantz,2019/01/11,"Humming feeling in right side of the chest Hey guys, I'm in full on panic mode right now and I feel like shit because of it.  


As of yesterday I noticed some weird humming that happens a couple of times a day, sort of like when you have the flu and hear that ""motorized"" breathing, except there's no snot and I don't feel sick.  


At first I thought it was really a snot deep down but then I noticed it happened when I wasn't breathing meaning it's not even connected to that.  


Has anyone had anything similar happen to them? Lately my eye is twitching like crazy, could it be connected to magnesium deficiency?

healthanxiety,1exp,2019/01/11,"I've never had an ulcer and can't remember the last time I had acid reflux. Upper stomach pain... brain says cancer, logic says acid reflux or ulcer. Help? Mostly asking what an ulcer really feels like.

 I've never had one before as far as I know (I'm 29) and have never been diagnosed with one. But then again, because of insurance issues, I've not really been able to see a doctor in like. Years. It's ridiculous. Long story. Anyway, I'm hoping to get insurance and be able to at least be seen within the next few months. Until then, though, reassurance is kind of all I can get.

I know what that sharp burning acid reflux feels like, I used to get it sometimes in high school, but generally, I don't ever experience that. I honestly can't remember the last time I got that sickly, burning acid reflux feeling. My diet's really bland out of preference (mostly vegetarian / some, but not a lot of meat) which I think contributes to a lot of my inexperience with acid reflux.

I have pain in my upper abdomen, right in the middle. I can't tell if I'm feeling it in my esophagus, liver or upper stomach.  It feels very close to the surface and hurts when I push on it. It doesn't really feel like the way acid does when it trickles up into the esophagus. The pain worsens when I have gas and eases up when that passes. It's dull and honestly easy enough to just work through, but the fact that I've been having it almost every day for a couple of weeks now concerns me.

Doesn't hurt to breathe. Just this dull ache ranging from annoying to actually kind of ouch, but still not enough to vocalise about. Just concerning because it keeps happening.

I used to drink a couple beers every night but now have since eliminated that to see if it makes a difference (I can't tell if it helps. Feels the same as when I drank every night.) 

Is it possible that this is just acid reflux and that it can feel different from the hot burning feeling in the heart area?

Does this sound more like an ulcer?

For what it's worth, I think I'm in fairly good health—just underweight (95lbs, 5'4"", Female) with no family history of cancer (but I recently learned I have a family history of gall bladder problems.) Mildly sedentary activity levels (work a desk job and tend to spend a lot of time writing at my computer while at home.)

Any advice to tide me over until insurance comes through would rock. Thank you so much for reading.",4.148252438734239,5.7525490256959335,5.2867255531763,80.26434005472281,71.59100642398288,8.35805377111587,25.606055198667626,8.920646497554287,1.979887033071616,1893,59,355,37,36,626,220,467,0.091,0.792,0.116,0.6493,2,0,2,0,0,0,66.0,0,1,0,2,19,23,2,0,24,0,27,24,8,3,6,75,62,35,0,7,19,0,11,5,0,1,12,4,1,0,30,15,4,1,18,4,2,3,14,10,0,2,9,25,27,13,57,50,14,64,0,4,3,0,10,28,0,13,37,228,57,9,0.15048402096132846,0.0,0.07342534843863023,0.0,0.0,0.07352562182340065,0.0,0.0,0.07534400481048963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051167147285331616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07034112287461468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09173366243584133,0.0,0.06402540908311424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08399496772330885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06481432964617223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16650770694188652,0.0,0.04852487214380748,0.0,0.0,0.07636905680599616,0.0,0.15722377301340906,0.0,0.07701338600393433,0.13168958083718038,0.0,0.0,0.07370852533849122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15549022056748113,0.0,0.0,0.0680607061661561,0.1901839169737856,0.0,0.0,0.07360112405993477,0.14186294222744628,0.0,0.34240159141633314,0.16125872196435326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11793253493006592,0.0,0.0,0.0631094285581732,0.06017790926985441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06653626137749577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07997873866591321,0.0,0.08916214469574285,0.10086626718335648,0.07949731514585642,0.07547387137065201,0.07473229374299642,0.0,0.0,0.16109625682365292,0.0,0.0,0.07853311045378017,0.07466608536938138,0.06687855607676632,0.0,0.15670595072617372,0.08270208242320727,0.12266456191820865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837972285005016,0.0,0.0,0.06658681154739939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19190419989271013,0.0,0.0,0.05022462625963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0600574549150139,0.0,0.05531153515997373,0.0,0.1740938310164992,0.0,0.08002073174818443,0.14121905960505746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10197186716046942,0.0,0.2401884123228217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482406149713204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07199644237452002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07526237203728152,0.0,0.19280783438281668,0.0,0.07429240808587641,0.0,0.17046906064248915,0.0642562658351266,0.0,0.11967093345478318,0.0,0.07614893158565662,0.11991628147430558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062240968599087725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07441627229860316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06008836676392565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13152966717191564,0.06927273416767524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642408435357074,0.07392489327269919,0.0,0.1316226641744857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299698777575601,0.0,0.06208253862735105,0.0,0.059723605692243616,0.0603546022794807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10955415951588666,0.0,0.0,0.053449765446719776,0.0,0.0,0.04845338784333233

healthanxiety,KeepOnSmithing,2019/01/12,Literally freaking out about basically nothing I’ve been going pretty good not worrying about any health related things and feeling great until today at work and I had a bit of indigestion when I got to work because I’ve changed my diet and drink the man shake every morning and this morning I drank it way to fast thus resulting in quite a bit of burning in my throat. About an hour later I got a shooting chest pain which I know would of been caused by the indigestion but whenever it happens I can’t shake the feeling it’s something else. Then throughout the day I get these nose twitches and got a fuzzy feeling between my eyes which I’m assuming is caused by the anxiety but thinking about it just gives me more anxiety.

healthanxiety,BillyEdward94,2019/01/12,"This has become devastating. m(24)So. I’ve always been a worrier. Worried about everything since I was little. I’ve struggled with OCD, and anxious thoughts for a long time. However, it seems that since a ER visit in the summer, I’ve been super aware of aches and pains more than I have in the past. It had led me down a road of constant deliberations on my own health. I have dealt with chest pain, lower-extremity pain, and seemingly much more. 

December was a rough month for me. A lot of stress about jobs and life changes. However, it seemed my health anxiety became insane. Heartburn ruined my Christmas. I have become so anxious. 

However, I am seemingly now facing my biggest challenge yet. For about a week now, possibly two. I have felt a small fluttering in my right abdomen. I have also been bloated and am constipated. I think it’s important to mention, I am not the best eater. Missing meals, not eating enough, eating one large meal a day, reliance on cereal. However, I went to see the doctor and she had said it was constipation. She prescribed some glyencol and said to up my fiber, and improve my diet. However, my intestines in the last three days have begun to contract or spasm. Almost like waves reverberating inside me. It’s not entirely stopping me from living, but it’s simply awful to feel. So now I fear the worst. I just want to live my life. The saddest part about HA is the fear that something could be wrong. I just needed to vent. This subreddit has been helpful. Thank you.

healthanxiety,mrsnetigowa,2019/01/12,"How do you get past the physical symptoms? Currently sitting in the bathroom hiding from my kids and crying. Whenever I get panicky or anxious, I always feel like I’m going to pass out/die. It will feel like I’m suffocating. It’s like it will start from my feet and go to my head. Then I get that lovely impending doom feeling, some serious derealization, then it’s game over. I will freak out, try to escape from wherever I am. They are so fun when you’re driving 🙃 I feel physically ill 24/7. I’m talking weak legs, arms, nauseous, brain fog (really bad). I visited the doctor 6 times last year, and also had 3 ER visits. Everything is always “anxiety”. Well, today I’m trying to catch up on housework (my family got hit by a really bad bug, sinus infections, strep throat) and I feel too weak to do anything! I’m shaking right now. I don’t know if I need to eat or something, or I’m about to keel over! My dr says I need medication at this point, because I am completely agoraphobic. I notice every twinge within my body. I’m feeling so helpless at this point, I can’t live like this anymore. Can you guys help me please? I know I need to help myself. It’s just hard. 😭",1.7245992907801444,3.97132170638298,3.9453457446808535,84.21645833333334,80.87234042553192,7.1507092198581566,23.834219858156022,8.212053250817874,1.6154432624113473,911,33,182,19,24,313,147,235,0.159,0.7070000000000001,0.134,-0.7321,1,0,1,0,0,0,40.0,0,2,1,0,10,16,0,1,4,0,13,18,7,1,0,23,40,15,0,4,5,0,7,4,0,3,9,1,0,2,9,5,1,0,8,1,0,8,2,9,2,0,2,8,27,7,22,34,1,32,1,2,0,1,13,12,0,5,15,95,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09557579767700213,0.1988914743367241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09142835644941827,0.135017501045737,0.11852638756413952,0.0,0.0,0.09835034817486768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19957942956006428,0.07285500247993787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327537991253189,0.0,0.13341784072044272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12530880421597432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13128119705522606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12232827686846713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12229329214826848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10069622117515296,0.0,0.10741203325744396,0.0,0.1126677463141788,0.0,0.3625810944332992,0.1707625354627987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18732436701313554,0.0,0.1358458244462533,0.0,0.09558675872467384,0.0,0.0,0.11833826292381412,0.0,0.0,0.10706162360765704,0.0,0.12265647911650228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16021625978195614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313642181081099,0.097420365931666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23355522381023655,0.0,0.10553359823285907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10786660985732742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12039840511996892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2658557269900147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13606818592906114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11409022724682975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311911621533448,0.2259598910871831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15312825062376711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020648316542222,0.0,0.09504282203626756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09200819270276488,0.0,0.0,0.08459306250386987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242214505260822,0.0,0.096061323661253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06968993548073665,0.0,0.11328588438435387,0.0,0.0,0.16228516238229765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10745799565711446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696349622923443
healthanxiety,iamanemotionaltampon,2019/01/12,"I am literally at my breaking point. I seriously don’t know what to do or even where to begin with all of this. Please bear with me, I know I’m likely going to be all over the place. 

Ok, for starters I am a 38 year old female with a pretty lengthy history of health anxiety, regular anxiety - if it’s anxiety related, I probably suffer from it. I worry about EVERYTHING. It’s as if I just get a simple thought in my head I have to run with it to the extreme. I have had every disease imaginable. MS, multiple types of cancer, the list could go on forever.... 

I see a psychiatric NP who has tried to put me on some different medication, which I cannot take. Once I read the side effects forget it. All bets are off and I just suffer. I do take a low dose of Xanax, which helps me in the midst of a really bad time, but I haven’t taken anything long term. I’ve seen therapists in the past and to be honest they were not that helpful. I assume just not the right fit or whatnot. 

Usually when my HA hits it will last for a couple of weeks or so and then I get over whatever my problem is at that time. I’ll do ok for a while and then it’ll dawn on me that, wow, I’ve been feeling pretty good lately! That’s when my brain is like “here, hold my beer”. Then all fucking hell breaks loose... which leads me to today. 

I’ve been having stomach issues for a while now.  A variety of symptoms that are all over the place. I went to my GP who did bloodwork. According to them, it was normal. I saw a gastroenterologist yesterday who isn’t overly concerned, but we’re doing an ultrasound and an endoscopy to just rule stuff out. Great. 

When I was at my GP appointment she asked me a bunch of questions. Blood in stool? No. Night sweats? No..... Wait, after I thought about this I realized I DO get night sweats sometimes. It’s not all the time, but it’s definitely happened a handful of times that I can remember. Like pretty bad too. Of course I didn’t tell her this because by the time I remembered I was long gone. What could night sweats possibly mean? Don’t worry - Dr. Google to the rescue. Lymphoma, leukemia?! Wtf. Now I’m losing my mind with worry. 

Next up. I have this weird hard area in my mouth. Looks like a mandibular tori. Of course I’m freaking out about this too. I go to the dentist religiously and I’m going to call them Monday morning just to make sure but in the meantime I’m seriously losing it.

I’m so concerned about my mental health. I need help. The only good thing about any of this is... I took half a pill of the lexapro I was prescribed that has been sitting on my nightstand for the last 6 months. I know it’s not doing anything right now, but I at least took it which is a huge step for me. 

All I can do is hope for peace and try to find a way to enjoy my life. I want to live! I am just debilitated and heated down by my anxiety. If it even is anxiety and not some terrible disease after all. 

Honestly, I just want to know I’m not alone in the way I feel. And I feel completely and utterly alone. Nobody understands. If you suffer from HA, or my ridiculous story is at all relatable to you, please by all means I would love to hear what you have to say. I just want to feel better.

healthanxiety,EquivalentPresence6,2019/01/12,"How do get over mild hearing loss in right ear? I've been crying and depressed. I've had health anxiety for a long time, but none of my fears have come true until now. It all started when I saw a video of tinnitus sufferers getting a temporary relief. I had no idea what tinnitus was so I googled it. Turns out I have a mild form of that and hearing things when it's quiet is not normal, it's tinnitus. I was shocked since I've had that ALL my life. I remember hearing the ""sound of silence"" AKA the ringing in my ears since I was very young. I was really shocked and scared at that time, since I never noticed this before. But that's not the peak of my misery. I read that tinnitus is often accompanied with hearing loss in any way. I then did countless online tests and always came back with the top score. 

However, I found an app that makes an audiogram of separate ears and how much hearing loss you have in them. I got my results and they said I had mild hearing loss in my right ear in the mid-range frequencies (but not the higher ones). I didn't think much of it at first until I tried blocking each ear individually to see if there was any difference in hearing and now I can hear a magnificent difference. My right hear is more muffled when I block out my left ear and my left ear sounds perfect.

How do I get over this? I got out of my depressive state around 6 months ago and have been doing so good since.. until I noticed all of this. I don't feel normal. I feel like I'm handicapped now and PERMANENTLY. This word is what makes all this so scary.. permanent. Means that I will NEVER hear normally in the right ear and this devastates me. Might devastate me more than the average person since I make music and music used to be a big part of my coping mechanism with depression. Please help how I can get over this, I can't accept that I have hearing loss even though it's mild. I don't know what to do. I can't afford a counselor and I don't want to tell my parents about this.

healthanxiety,Oskmen,2019/01/12,"Hair loss I am 17 years old and luckily I do not experience hair loss. However, I sporadically drink alcohol and smoke. I find myself at a party about every two months where I drink not more than seven 30ml vodka glasses and smoke six cigarettes. Not more than that though. My question is, given my age and the quantity, can it affect my hair more than it would affect a completely grown man's?

I’ve had two other people feel for me and they swear they don’t feel anything. I have a stretch mark literally right above it, but this feels like it’s under the skin. I have to really search for it to find it.

I’m 18 and make if that helps, I really just posted because if look up anything about a back hump it gives you things like a sarcoma or bone cancer or something 😩I been feeling my back so constantly that it’s making it sore which just freaks me out more. I would go to the doctor but I literally just went for something else not even a week ago and she already thinks I’m a bit overboard on the HA stuff 😂 plus apparently nobody else can feel anything 🤷‍♂️

I just wondered if anybody else has this?

healthanxiety,letsmakeitbrahs,2019/01/13,"Anyone notice that health problems naturally ebb and flow? Just with the passage of time I've had things I thought to be major problems like dry/itchy eyes, leg edema, blurry vision, armpit sweating/hyperhydrosis, allergies/allergic shiners, constant anxiety, etc. completely disappear and/or return with the passage of time.

Kind of makes me think worrying about things as long as the Dr. says everything is OK and nothing major is going on is pointless as things just ebb and flow naturally.

Anyone else notice anything similar?",10.54534090909091,11.449640125000005,9.376272727272726,59.1869090909091,56.84090909090909,12.04,42.6,11.602472056035307,5.64806090909091,433,22,56,11,5,135,64,88,0.142,0.78,0.078,-0.6149,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,3,1,5,5,3,1,0,12,9,6,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,4,5,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,2,2,2,3,11,6,3,10,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,6,31,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13719001048800367,0.0,0.0,0.2507889892278765,0.18374886412169034,0.14757659244452878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18802827516799456,0.1937963322056224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14981053591444046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20000480218671549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16117382551089587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10191963852507582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906236439405173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18674875256139611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08761352836354706,0.0,0.0,0.15870493667782146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11970683000082978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17207579881105434,0.4083458694791031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34319681518142564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14261358574435987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574246003930045,0.11490997876251392,0.0,0.1423711552177596,0.2091421819400187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18212237059215666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,krychaz,2019/01/13,"Terrified of 'Venous Leak' Hello,

I'm turning 21 in April and I've struggled with health anxiety for past 3 and a half years. Recently I've been getting better and even managed to get myself into a relationahip which was great.

The thing is, two weeks ago I noticed that I seem to struggle with getting/keeping erections. So I obviously started Googling, which was not helpful(as always)  as it said its mostly thing old guys get and so on. What it did notice was a terrifying thing called Venous Leak, which means your veins can't trap blood for erection, there is no fix for that and you're doomed. So I started stressing over this so badly, I wanted to know everything about it, thing is, out of all my health scares, I never seen a condition so poorly reported, there is very little information about it and no statistics and contradicting facts, which is fueling my anxiety even more. 

So I'm sitting here worrying that surely I must have it and seeing it seems to be very unknown I definitely have it. Has anyone heard or knows more about this?

Haven’t been myself all weekend out of fear. I have a (ladies stuff) doctors appointment tomorrow morning &amp; am terrified. I’ve rescheduled it once already out of fear but decided to bite the bullet &amp; actually go. It’s been two years &amp; I just need an annual exam/check up. 

So what am I so afraid of? Because you hear these stories of women (or anyone) going for a checkup &amp; bam! cancer. Or having to have more tests taken &amp; play the two week before results waiting game. I don’t think my anxious mind could handle that. 

I feel deep down that it might turn out fine but my “what if” thoughts keep finding ways to justify my fear and extreme anxiety over this. Which in turn, makes me fear the absolute worst case scenario.

healthanxiety,TheColorOfSnails,2019/01/13,"Advice for heart attack anxiety with hangovers? I slept pretty badly last night. First time I've had a hangover (and honestly it's very mild). I woke up with heart burn, chest pain, and a pain in my neck/ back. It won't away after a moment but it convinced me I might be having a heart attack. Now, I'm mildly nauseous when I stand up, which gives me some chest pressure, which freaks me out. That makes it hard to breathe, and causes typical anxiety symptoms (which also feel like heart attack symptoms!)

I'm doing a little better since I woke up my SO to keep me company, and humming sort of makes the anxiety go away because I can feel the hum in my chest. Does anyone have any advice that's helped them in the past with this?",3.8246212121212118,5.295131361111113,4.4293434343434335,86.6227272727273,72.19444444444444,6.903030303030302,24.202020202020197,7.348242739294969,1.0178277777777789,572,16,112,6,11,182,91,144,0.188,0.718,0.093,-0.8883,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,1,2,5,12,3,1,8,0,8,14,10,3,0,18,20,8,0,0,1,0,3,1,0,2,4,0,0,0,10,8,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,8,0,1,4,3,14,4,17,13,1,22,0,0,0,0,3,10,0,3,11,69,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2237020702839896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09153529654328506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07783815011960613,0.0,0.26268956964435897,0.0,0.0,0.08003455866000705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906514742851506,0.21508181346400196,0.08801428623710499,0.09557106878908124,0.06977503111404908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012324219455164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11758410227560945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001665512563275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11575094953118717,0.08177174400832475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973614000932792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098024720538397,0.0650514467421857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10253555506228912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5425525378705542,0.07672152996179607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10173916983599716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09330188501326143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055920398234477725,0.11472109012028398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15280867532823822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12142619519761814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10741492289955427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2435914799147341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10926702196117014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1164491011498614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09468422834654194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23793988828362156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06674376845767722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944432163578392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,yip404,2019/01/13,"Booked a health test - total regression Hi,
I've experienced health anxiety on and off for most of my life. It has become a lot better over the years and I have found ways to cope and calm myself down. I'm not the HA-type that goes to doctors a lot - actually almost never - partly because my ""rational"" part knows that it's just HA and partly because it's so crazy expensive. My main tools for managing HA has been ""act normal"" (even if I feel worried and obsess, do not take action - don't look for reassurance, don't see a doctor, don't google - don't feed the monster), setting a specific time when it's ok to worry (""between 6-7 at night, worry time. At other times, just postpone it."") and writing down what I worry about. It's been going well for the last few years and I almost considered myself ""cured"".
Until I decided to go for an extensive health check with a battery of tests. There's no particular symptom that brought on this, just that it's something I should start doing regularly at my age. What normal people do. However, as soon as I booked the test and got the list of tests, HA totally exploded. In a way worse than the usual HA where I used to focus on just a few illnesses - now I basically convinced that with that many tests and possible cancers, I must check positive for at least one! Has anyone else experience this kind of setback and how did you cope? I still have two-three more weeks before the results.",5.301646682653875,6.014382266187052,6.223261390887291,77.95313349320546,68.06474820143886,9.343245403677058,29.47322142286171,9.444778638647367,2.5527067945643482,1122,39,213,22,18,372,163,278,0.109,0.79,0.101,0.1022,1,0,1,0,0,0,46.0,0,1,0,1,15,12,0,1,17,5,17,10,0,3,4,39,30,17,0,5,7,0,1,0,0,2,9,0,0,0,18,12,1,0,4,2,3,5,8,1,1,1,6,4,18,11,35,22,13,38,0,0,2,0,4,13,0,6,17,148,36,10,0.0,0.0,0.10312252777970186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21163438497258708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084027955248092,0.0,0.0,0.07388968018060788,0.10827544578653696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12883571346999406,0.1167085711280028,0.08992074490866926,0.0,0.0,0.09346001785601524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21632352331940197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827702221284801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06979664478875414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10336939656243732,0.0,0.0,0.05343192231367238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11586602754748232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.120113877693382,0.0,0.08451710822444017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3369793896213349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11004315335671228,0.05807563718444294,0.08613837021534883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0746406333064162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873950009164437,0.0,0.0,0.1796804201391738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071367952012032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815022618529757,0.0,0.0,0.0991678399001247,0.20707606102205872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07160740076564047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34330375744642644,0.0,0.07326100866069654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11913149646727535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08420845341924617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135296649814568,0.0,0.0,0.07479656297657139,0.0,0.08439134988959454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098356918676411,0.07945365621014726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18485798339951312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10322809035090323,0.0,0.0,0.09126836041357493,0.1163849221672278,0.0,0.0,0.1677581194524393,0.08476526543691694,0.0,0.09501356850788806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42926808735007377,0.1076907790913724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13610111331159574
healthanxiety,ReallyCoolGuy36,2019/01/13,"Having a bit of a health scare right now, could use some help making sure this doesn't spiral out of control. Hi everyone, new here, but could use some help.

I am a 27 year old male.  I have a history of health anxiety/hypochondria and I also have an undiagnosed chronic inflammatory pain condition.  I also have GERD and barrett's esophagus.

I stopped taking the prilosec I was taking for my GERD and also haven't been to a doctor in about 4 or 5 years to get an endoscopy.  For those of you who don't know Barrett's Esophagus is a precancerous condition.   This is also where the concern comes in.

I drink pretty heavily, not everyday, but definitely on weekends, and I also smoke socially.

Leading up to New Year's I started noticing that I could feel liquids going down into my stomach a little more than usual.  This was a little alarming, then my GERD started getting worse.  Then I started having problems swallowing and then I completely lost my appetite.  I've been struggling with appetite loss and swallowing problems for a couple weeks now.

Now when you google the symptoms these are all common symptoms of Esophageal cancer.  This is where the fun has begun.  I don't know where the cycle started, but I am thoroughly convinced I have cancer at this point.  

I've made a doctor's appointment to my primary, and asked for a referral to a Gastroenterologist.   Gastroenterologist office says they are ""reviewing my file"" so I can't make an appointment yet. This concerns me, dont want to jump through hoops because part of my file is missing. 

In the meantime, I'm just trying to get through the days.  Super hungry, but zero appetite so I've been forcing myself to eat which is awful.   But I also feel like I've been worrying myself to death thinking it's cancer and spending time on my phone ""researching"".  

What can I do?  Tonight I was going to take a xanax, turn my phone off and watch a movie to try and calm myself down, but I didn't end up doing that.  I just ended up looking at more esophageal cancer stuff.  

How do I stop worrying about this until I get my doctor appointments.  It might be a month or two at this rate before I get an endoscopy!

healthanxiety,TheBigShrimp,2019/01/14,"Lymph node just...gone? 21M, I’ve been worried about lymphoma for over a year now. I had a lump in my armpit that I didn’t know if it was a lymph node/cyst/muscle/nothing at all for over a year. It never grew, changed, anything. I check it from time to time and get anxious once in a while, but have gotten it relatively under control (the anxiety). 

Anyways, I go to the gym today like any other normal day, come home to shower and it’s....not there? I cracked my shoulder at the gym but nothing else out of the ordinary (I did work shoulders) and it’s just not sticking out like it did, and I’m thoroughly confused and quite honestly anxious for no reason at all. I have been dealing with a shoulder injury for as long as I can remember as well. 

Where did it go? Was it not a lymph node then? It’s still the slightest bit asymmetrical from my right armpit, but not like usual. Was it likely not even a lymph node then? 

I’ve been told that if it remained unchanged for so long (14 months from noticing it) that it’s either unlikely a lymph node or just a shotty one. It’s rare that lymphoma would leave the same node unchanged for such a long time I was told.

healthanxiety,xKiwil,2019/01/14,"Young adult cancers?? How are people with HA suppose to cope with their disorders when there are constant stories about young adults getting “rare” cancers and reading articles that say certain cancers such as bowel/colon and brain cancers are increasing. Telling yourself “I’m too young” is apparently not good enough anymore as being young doesn’t matter to these cancers.

healthanxiety,anxietyridden2themax,2019/01/14,"hantavirus?!? hello fellow reddit people. i go over to my boyfriends every weekend and i think it was the 29th of december when i went to start packing, i opened the dresser and seen that the mice chewed through some wood and shit everywhere. one shirt had a massive pile of crap and wood shavings on it and got all through my clothes. so i just started taking them all out except for the one shirt that had the most droppings. i haven’t open the closet till i needed a shirt tuesday, put it on and forgot about the mice poop but i didn’t think much of it. i got really bummed thinking about how pretty much all my clothes were destroyed with mice feces and urine (i’ll admit i let them go for about a week). so last night i put gloves on and put all my clothes in trash bags. i threw away the shirt that had the main crap on it. then i started vacuuming out my drawers with a shirt tied around my neck cause i was scared to breathe it in. then of course i got online and started reading about the virus and began to go into panic mode.  i read that if you vacuumed the poop up it can become airborne but i didn’t worry about that until after i started overthinking. i slept two hours because i was so terrified that i was gonna die in my sleep. this morning i got so frightened with getting the ‘hantavirus’ that i immediately went to the ER and they took my blood, urine and an EKG. the tests came back fine turns out i’m just dehydrated. yet my anxiety still is causing me to freak out and constantly thing i have the virus. i’m scared to death (literally). my anxiety is making me think also that they misdiagnosed me which happens a lot with this disease. my boyfriend and many people have reassured me that i’m okay and that i didn’t get the virus yet idk if it’s my anxiety mimicking the symptoms of the virus or what but i’m very positive that i will be dead soon. i just need some opinions from strangers i guess?",3.1892187499999984,4.977375317708333,3.7478124999999984,89.5659375,74.46875,6.6750000000000025,25.802083333333336,7.413659706084162,1.1461395833333334,1518,53,315,18,32,477,191,384,0.171,0.78,0.049,-0.9946,0,0,0,0,0,1,29.0,0,1,4,0,21,11,4,3,24,1,20,19,17,4,4,60,60,32,3,4,10,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,4,0,24,28,1,1,5,3,0,11,4,8,1,3,24,1,49,3,46,32,11,54,0,0,1,0,9,18,3,9,24,215,73,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07944675545713559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2279976663516536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843877453943139,0.0,0.0,0.09333859660066476,0.07639074476704225,0.0,0.06056024335170565,0.10971956887385602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11362506494613064,0.0,0.20411088993893609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735745587019356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031051974369394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370307393296292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10380810162526706,0.0,0.1693814269454651,0.0,0.3178234670247153,0.0,0.10944053717921767,0.0,0.08785111318436771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09783554600736308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08098004073033335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10158775395764737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08446019877632288,0.0,0.0,0.06631405544630838,0.10072099132385104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1460611051820679,0.1473272205057203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09322925072966284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13463849422963886,0.0,0.0,0.11656082516129995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13774765996748284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10107033692605616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29960973611676195,0.0,0.0,0.19874525642065954,0.0,0.06364342739779573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19892484118025056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101976978416236,0.0,0.0,0.0994174901492302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3515871441025016,0.0,0.07933763936166788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10325826665688442,0.07469563563817161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06600089782727801,0.2546269649923449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11037677681148614,0.0,0.10805964145067896,0.09704635623162892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08197064299691753,0.0,0.0,0.07968916326647561,0.0,0.0,0.184188999686318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10089042522784776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Kismekate,2019/01/14,"Post Partum Health Anxiety? Did anyone's health anxiety stem from having a baby?  I was about one year PP when this all began, but never attributed it to childbirth.  I recently found an article that says it can be caused by that.  I've found lots of other posts on baby forums talking about it, but no medical research.  I'm going to see a counselor for the first time next week so I'm trying to do my homework if I feel as though postpartum depression and anxiety might be a factor here.  

Also, hi!  This is my first post.  I'm a recent victim of HA, as it began for me around 3 months ago.  I've been completely debilitated since then.  Very hard to take care of 2 kids when I'm at my worst.  Really looking for support and faith that there's a cure for feeling this way.",2.9354795204795217,4.724621409090911,4.661168831168832,82.74362137862138,75.16883116883116,7.8553446553446555,24.183816183816184,8.617729084823388,1.7080795204795205,603,19,118,12,13,204,106,154,0.14300000000000002,0.748,0.109,-0.5714,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,2,10,7,1,0,7,1,10,3,0,2,2,16,26,13,0,1,3,0,3,0,0,1,3,1,1,1,11,3,0,0,4,0,0,1,2,3,0,3,7,6,7,4,20,16,3,24,1,1,2,0,4,3,0,3,16,76,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12082886037008628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10900549689680963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31282585133868823,0.0,0.0,0.0953097566196821,0.0,0.0,0.12134306188019138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1389751395925623,0.1400259132787871,0.0,0.0,0.14291639516594995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11740192217837825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378428895345093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2318871123276115,0.0,0.2989094785373876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746700501084995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12210523755576272,0.0,0.0,0.2897781623645245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11446443042673488,0.0,0.0,0.11588422815559407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13731601822501532,0.0,0.1446012985553206,0.0,0.0,0.10879978361661934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10512916989454492,0.0,0.1449651556391464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09236586113864924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3916362934456157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08732242604237975,0.0,0.26917550653916394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10839763093111293,0.0,0.0,0.10861986655092544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11275542603748673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.154680757771086,0.0,0.0,0.1024866884986256,0.10955924588406307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339219652802946,0.0,0.07948231906425647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09254421723083582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11246841509658473,0.0,0.10819498404178916,0.10933809428932408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08777791400429129
healthanxiety,psykotikz1,2019/01/14,"Trouble getting deep breath? I’ve had trouble getting a deep breath throughout my whole life but for the last few years I feel like it never goes away. I honestly can’t live like this anymore.

I just went to see a pulmonologist and a cardiologist and everything came back fine. I know I have gastric issue (hiatal hernia) and that can be the cause but I barely even feel like I have reflux so why would the main symptom be this breathing issue?

Right now my mind is fixated on this MS “hug” and I have now convinced myself I have MS. I need to schedule an MRI or I won’t be able to get past this.

Has anyone else had this “air hunger” trouble getting a deep breath issue and actually solved it?",1.942287104622871,4.436198167883216,3.1311240875912425,88.88145498783457,81.91970802919708,5.405158150851581,23.001946472019462,6.742157984588678,0.7204874939172751,547,19,108,6,15,176,86,137,0.091,0.7490000000000001,0.16,0.8972,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,6,10,0,0,8,0,15,9,4,1,1,18,26,9,0,2,4,0,2,3,0,2,3,0,0,0,8,6,1,0,3,0,0,2,3,3,0,0,4,3,14,7,6,17,3,17,0,0,1,1,0,7,0,1,11,69,22,0,0.155713807261689,0.0,0.1519542139006689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15442625525542036,0.1088787145637264,0.15954719694600258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14629824770744634,0.11973430614453295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17809511287579516,0.0,0.15996097340004956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13007890520780624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284750112445327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399455294825526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15746715925584287,0.2224839500416809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.325416149775385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4875742771919978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08557623620315795,0.12692753576328172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10998526707330243,0.22822170245954124,0.0,0.13749814462126767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15722655631759086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154598150420548,0.12009608761193614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486464484158326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13297874059569426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408374405297805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16184626749683567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14434825936146434,0.14050749132029364,0.17384890494703265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11061462103131636,0.0,0.0,0.10027458659881773

healthanxiety,llamaluloo,2019/01/14,"Rabies HA is driving me batty Hi fellow anxiety sufferers

&amp;#x200B;

I've been good for months but my HA has decided to welcome the new year with a flare up. A few nights ago I was reading in my bedroom with the window open, when I heard some rustling/flapping at the curtain. I went to take a look and couldn't see anything except for two large geckos. I guess they could have been chasing each other on the curtain, causing the rustling, but who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I went back to the bed and was facing away from the window with my hand resting behind my head, when I felt a sharp sensation in one of my fingers. I looked around and couldn't see anything, and there were no puncture wounds or marks on my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story kinda short, I've convinced myself that a rabid bat flew into my room, snuck up on me, nipped my finger and then ninja'ed itself away – this despite there being no actual sighting of a bat or any wound.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise how irrational and ridiculous this all sounds, but nonetheless, the fear of dying from rabies is real and it's driving me a little nutty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to mention that I don't live in a rabies hot spot, the incidence of rabies in humans from bat bites in my country is very low, and apparently fewer than 0.5% of the bat population is rabid. So...

I really just want to go get some rabies shots but I reckon my doctor will think I'm nuts. Any advice on how to deal with this anxiety or any words to help put my mind at ease would be much appreciated!",7.754248587570622,6.851976379661018,7.559999999999999,75.88960451977401,63.16949152542373,9.629378531073447,33.90395480225989,8.447377352677275,2.673910734463276,1212,42,220,13,15,387,172,295,0.08900000000000001,0.7909999999999999,0.12,0.9098,1,0,0,0,0,0,54.0,0,0,1,0,12,9,1,1,18,2,19,9,6,3,1,47,36,21,1,5,10,0,7,0,1,2,3,2,7,1,9,16,0,0,5,1,0,7,5,4,0,2,10,14,27,5,41,19,7,39,0,2,5,0,10,22,0,7,10,152,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.06896789714116593,0.0,0.0,0.06906208320407067,0.06264848020775204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4594532821317234,0.5152618760793419,0.144182790794563,0.0,0.10813125327860776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163178123454448,0.06291508822697815,0.0,0.0,0.13280161491823633,0.05434415471915169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07260194815832502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056427657464960784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07286207383488794,0.0,0.0,0.07334873902524285,0.0,0.0,0.07233811479766589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07952820756395924,0.0,0.0,0.06785838684021757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03692439151515397,0.0,0.04016581895510099,0.05927822843191191,0.0,0.0,0.07785568138066415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07253219528750021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04737147652713861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038840733038477036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083418996606207,0.062406679301040435,0.06254450904781995,0.1186971818176024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07136087039389176,0.0,0.05641153172873061,0.0,0.051953723731000614,0.0,0.0,0.06825765482601404,0.0,0.06632301912298202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047890717546229804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07104716635741885,0.0,0.0,0.0706934000811155,0.08044279708387486,0.045275750038964085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11263649328383488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053138258991258014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04528522147352464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0690384969287131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05831367816922661,0.04168551827742047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131031521253574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05020497694511975,0.0,0.5152618760793419,0.04551191570732579

healthanxiety,hdheje,2019/01/14,"Anxiety or actually ill? So I don't know where to start this so I'm just gonna get to the point. I'm an otherwise healthy 20 y/o female and last week my legs started feeling very itchy. Then, the itching moved upwards to my torso and arms. On wednesday I noticed two strange rashes on my arms and decided to see a doctor because the itching was just horrible. He said it's probably an allergy and that he can't do much until i figure out at least if it's food or something enviromental causing the problem, and he gave me allergy pills to ease my itching and rashes. He said to take two if the rashes reappear. So the next day, when I got another one on my arm, I took just one pill, and they stopped appearing. The next day, I took one more just to be sure and the itching and rashes were totally gone by friday. Now, the problem is, on friday I thought my breathing was a bit more labored than usual. It's probably all in my brain but the feeling hasn't gone away. If I put my mind to something else, I'm fine, but as soon as I start thinking about it, I get panicky. It's been the same for 4 days now, and I'm not sure what to do about it. Also, on friday, when I had lunch I ate very little until I started feeling very sick. The same on saturday and sunday. Is it all due to my anxiety? I'm nervous to see a doctor because I don't want him to think I'm making stuff up, because I was just at his office a few days ago, and now I'd show up with another problem.

healthanxiety,skred12,2019/01/14,"Squeezing feeling in my ribs Hey guys. Really glad I found this sub - seems really helpful! Was just wondering if anybody experiences a similar symptom to what I have a lot of the time.

Most of the time my body feels okay? Okay enough, I guess. But once every 2/3 days I seem to get symptoms in and around my ribcage area. That entire section of my body suddenly feels very tense, and it gives me added symptoms too. When I stand up I get more lightheaded, my breathing because shallower by default, my heart races, and I sweat a ton. I also feel like there's a general squeezing action occuring around my ribcage. For example,  when I take certain breaths I can physically feel the tension in my rib area. Because this area is so close to my heart, I worry that it is actually my heart malfunctioning. I hope that isn't the case and it's more to do with my ribcage area being tense or something.

The weird thing is that most of the time when this symptom comes along I'm not even nervous. It just always seems to happen in the evening when I'm watching the TV, or having just been for a walk.

What makes it worse is that it doesn't leave either. The only way I can make it stop is by going to sleep and then my body 'resetting' to normal the next morning. Sex can help the issue, but other times it makes it worse too. My body just feels full of adrenaline when the symptom start.

So I was just wondering if anybody had anything similar? I just don't understand the source of it all. I'm rarely anxious mentally beforehand, but it seems as if my body is anxious. It just comes on so randomly. The problem is that from there on the symptoms it gives me are so uncomfortable that I worry about it. It makes me wonder if I have a heart problem or something along those lines. Is it just all an internal anxiety attack built up from all of the tension my anxiety disorder in general gives me?

healthanxiety,handy-mandy,2019/01/15,"To medicate or not to medicate? Hello friends. This is my first post here. I’ve been admiring the confidence that you all have in sharing your concerns and stories. Thank you for your honesty. I have enjoyed learning from each interesting thing that you all have to say. 

I have been dealing with severe health anxiety for a little over 1 year now. The destruction it has done is devastating. 

I am entering into a new chapter in my life with many new important roles. Going back to school for my bachelors is one of them. I will need to be face-to-face with many of my specific fears and phobias. 

I’ve been considering starting medication for anxiety, such as Buspar. This scares me. My health anxiety is thinking of all of the possible side effects. 

I am tempted to do this because I want relief. Counseling has only helped mildly. 
CBT has only helped mildly. 
I want to be normal again. 

Thoughts?

Is it possible that it could have affected me? ,3.0377083333333315,5.3122831875,4.42625,82.32708333333336,76.5,6.7666666666666675,34.104166666666664,7.793537801064563,2.8073729166666666,260,15,46,4,6,86,47,64,0.197,0.8029999999999999,0.0,-0.8879,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,8,2,2,2,0,8,11,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,4,0,4,7,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,32,13,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3759696505009754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5314279742930896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2221468077313787,0.0,0.3343426677351045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3751823733438938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3184449747587552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422826073840829,0.33797489452555274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,krkn614,2019/01/15,"Whooshing / flowing in ears / head anyone? Sometimes when I wake up in the morning (especially if I wake up suddenly, scared, due to a loud noise, or from a bad dream) I’ll jump up quick and I can kind of hear flowing in my left ear which I expect to be my blood flow or something. I’m not sure if this is due to the sudden rush of blood or what, after laying down all night. It totally scares me to death. It lasts maybe 20 seconds and goes away. This is the only time it happens. 
I’ve brought it up to doctors and they don’t really seem to say too much.

healthanxiety,mariadelaluz,2019/01/15,"Diabetes Anxiety Helloo everyone, I’m new here I could really use someones advice im kind of freaking out, I haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes, but I’m really scared that I have it and I know the smartest thing to do is to make an appt with your doctor so I did but my doctor is out for a couple weeks, so my appt isn’t until feb. So a little about me I have been diagnosed with Anxiety, and I’m known to overreact, but I can’t get myself to calm down. I’m always scared that I have diabetes because I am over weight I’m like 50-60 pounds overweight I’m only 19 years old, and I know I need to lose weight and get healthy it’s really hard for me and my weight is something that I really struggle with. So with that being said diabetes has always been in the back of my mind and some days it creeps up and takes over me and I’m freaking out about it the whole day. Today is worse because I learned about something called DKA I don’t know much about it but what I did read about it is making me scared, usually when I have anxiety I’ll take a nap or something now I don’t even want to do that after reading something about it. I’m not really always thirsty all the time, I usually have to force myself to drink water. I sometimes feel like I pee a lot but I wake up when I’m sleeping to pee except for when I wake up in the morning I always have to pee, and before I go to bed I get up 2-3x to pee. Sometimes I feel like my feet and toes are tingly like if there falling asleep and then it will go away, as for blurry vision my vision is bad to begin with, I’m also always on my phone which probably dosen’t help. I haven’t had any significant amount of weight loss, if anything I’ve gained more weight. I also keep watch when I get a scratch or a cut and I just had one on my leg about 2 weeks ago and it healed fine. I’m also TIRED all the time, I get super super tired sometimes I take a nap and sometimes I try to fight it out until the it’s time to sleep at night this could be because my sleep pattern is all over the place and I’m currently trying to get it back on track but I don’t know. I know I probably sound dumb, and I know you guys can’t diagnose me but maybe if someone could just help me out, ease my mind, or let let me know what they think, I should probably get off the internet and relax but I can’t, always this was just what I am thinking right now so if something I said about anything in here is false regarding the symptoms or the whole DKA thing I do apologize, also sorry for making this so long.

healthanxiety,NylonRiot,2019/01/15,"Muscle Weakness from Anxiety? Hello all! This is a wordy post but I really need some input on this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a heaping helping of OCD and GAD. Since last summer I have been going through a huge amount of stress from changing medications and not yet having found the right combination, all while working full time with ADHD. I also started taking blood pressure medication because that's just how my body responds to antidepressants/I have bad genes, clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Two months ago, I started having full body muscle weakness. I don't necessarily feel it all the time, although I am a lot more prone to soreness now. But any time I try to do anything physical (climbing stairs, washing dishes, actual exercise) my muscles start getting fatigued and that ""burning"" sensation that comes with a lot of activity. I feel like I have about a third of the stamina I usually do (and my baseline stamina isn't great), and I'll feel like I've done a long workout after basically nothing. I have always had a tendency to muscle stiffness but never experienced anything like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

My doctor has run a bunch of tests and there's absolutely no medical reason she can find for this. This started a few weeks after I started a blood pressure medication that worked, but my blood pressure is not low and she cannot find any electrolyte imbalance/anything else that might be caused by it. Neither my PCP nor psychiatrist have ever heard of a side effect like this for any of the medications I'm on.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, have any of you ever heard of or experienced muscle weakness like I'm describing as a side effect of stress/anxiety? I definitely have had physical illnesses from anxiety before (pain, dizziness, nausea) but this is new. I wouldn't be surprised if this was from the stress of the past few months, but I really can't say. Any input would be very appreciated!",6.275319767441863,8.046787194767443,6.687446511627908,71.62499534883723,66.58720930232558,9.108651162790698,34.69023255813953,9.490545024520769,3.574160372093023,1521,72,243,31,25,493,179,344,0.129,0.755,0.116,-0.6152,0,0,0,0,0,0,57.0,0,1,0,5,10,19,0,5,19,0,34,22,5,5,7,48,52,22,0,4,11,0,3,5,0,3,16,3,0,0,15,10,1,1,10,2,0,4,11,12,0,2,8,8,26,7,31,38,14,41,0,2,0,0,10,10,0,7,31,171,41,4,0.0,0.0,0.06796285624105522,0.0,0.08369899563776123,0.0,0.061735529580742375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05569457543110739,0.057949692753211934,0.3018385718318125,0.3385021172850829,0.23680279012393105,0.0,0.1598332512595783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17193414080452554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058150137714231415,0.04245455993854374,0.0,0.059262227089427515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15471838391844778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07154394972207463,0.07367450617333456,0.059992455763214936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07128396109685424,0.0,0.07127036783652743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05817893237505716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12599463501903024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10564285417765326,0.0995078999422096,0.0,0.0,0.1273073801404768,0.0,0.0,0.0763614541165435,0.0,0.0,0.036386307490227546,0.0,0.039580498936517695,0.0,0.0,0.07678316090147727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04668115141383325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056769454723712275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17012360014231895,0.0,0.0,0.061633073549913736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11841830127882827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35079686587604864,0.0,0.0738816679809208,0.0,0.0,0.11117893919166782,0.0,0.0,0.05164041595089621,0.053714029561685375,0.06726296399608535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0668256488190513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07410651718417076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06648342908761014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06670005246773493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07801763032663228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892319301777699,0.07160600891853967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059475909211241414,0.0,0.05538399625994368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05761054038087921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2464732084419649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2393321625864012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052363896920487964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12183057205144865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04728395387394841,0.0,0.0680324272068322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07670343138577176,0.057463896835804114,0.0,0.0,0.05586451062789037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014038578245355,0.0,0.0,0.04947336039146898,0.0,0.3385021172850829,0.0
healthanxiety,Robotsailor,2019/01/15,"Lump near groin, between pubic area and inner thigh I'm kinda scared. I have a pea sized lump in that place you see when you open your legs, where your legs move, very close to the pubic region and the inner thigh. It's a hardish lump, like cartilage. If i move the skin it moves with it, do it's not stuck on the bone or tendon. I have a small red bump right next to it too which is kinda irritated, but the ""big"" one is the one that freaks me out the most. When I fully open my legs you can see a bit of protrusion. I found it yesterday night, it feels like it came out of nowhere.

healthanxiety,TheMessyNess,2019/01/16,"Proud of Myself Hi everyone! It's been a while since I posted on this sub and I really wanted to share a small success story to hopefully help you if you need it.

So this past summer I was active on here all the time. I was convinced I had a brain tumour, bone cancer, blood clots, and a bunch of other issues. 

I ended up starting therapy in September and it's been going great! I've been able to stop immediately seeking reassurance (i.e. going to the ER) and dealing with my fear of death. I still struggle with googling and the initial worry of symptoms, but I can honestly say I'm starting to get better.

Anyways, I feel like I had a major milestone today - even if it doesn't really seem like that big of a deal. 

My health anxiety is mostly focused on myself, but also extends to other people I care about, like my family. So naturally, when my mom told me she found a large lump on her breast while showering, I panicked. Like full blown panic. I immediately thought the worst (shocker), especially because just two months ago she'd gotten called back for an abnormal mammogram and had to do a bunch of imaging tests to make sure it was nothing terrible. That week waiting for results was excruciating (thankfully it was just benign cysts). Naturally, this brought me back to that terrible week of worry, and I was immediately thinking that, despite 2 mammograms + an ultrasound not even two full months ago, that the doctors must have missed something and that she had a terrible disease.

My initial instinct was to google - I tend to seek out information in times of stress because it helps me feel like I have some control over the situation. I was so tempted to google incidence rates of breast cancer, likelihood of breasts cyst vs. cancer, and the like. I had intentions of reassuring myself, but I also knew that doing that would only feed into my anxiety and make it worse. Despite how badly I wanted to do research, I forced myself to ignore the compulsion. I was also able to rationalize and talk through my fears to come up with a logical conclusion (i.e. family history of cystic breasts = likelihood of cyst vs. cancer)

Thankfully, our family doctor believes that it's just a cyst that was seen on the mammogram, but filled with fluid due to her upcoming period. He's sending her for an ultrasound to be safe, but overall isn't worried.

However, despite all this, I feel really proud of myself! I managed to avoid Googling because I knew it would harm me, even if I was convinced it would help me. I really feel like I accomplished something, and I hope that sharing this encourages any of you who need help to get it. Therapy has been a godsend for me, even if it's just in small steps like this.",7.640385264341957,7.534618769685043,8.07075365579303,69.5137007874016,63.074803149606296,11.351631046119234,36.64679415073115,10.914260884657429,4.15746209223847,2157,94,370,52,28,714,241,508,0.135,0.642,0.223,0.9936,2,1,2,0,0,0,68.0,1,3,0,7,22,43,0,6,24,0,36,24,7,6,4,74,72,31,1,14,16,1,4,8,0,4,16,1,1,0,33,19,1,6,13,0,0,7,3,14,1,2,28,6,57,29,58,38,10,49,0,1,1,4,31,18,0,9,31,263,90,7,0.15291807442849373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355526464322161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18343279330903176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05199476719779278,0.0,0.11698190838262205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11758456016609473,0.06384010237777812,0.1398261582560367,0.0,0.0,0.08614315222937623,0.0,0.06762180503824759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08535357205289343,0.07807322562858754,0.0,0.07795508416763287,0.0,0.0,0.06586269041424209,0.0,0.0,0.08575531167967418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15765182012566145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565181288711889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677200127272447,0.0,0.0,0.20200189191062431,0.0,0.0,0.0730598866382693,0.0,0.0,0.21623632681661795,0.17207534748738126,0.1546399462101706,0.16386705438928792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08383338784979483,0.0,0.0,0.07989338242811911,0.0,0.08690686569612109,0.0,0.0,0.08429635845282035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0812723811729758,0.0,0.0,0.20499552382950467,0.0,0.0,0.15188215178992784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07980337017016842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29883218790187194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10207400210932777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08954790029834674,0.12205774808529453,0.0,0.0,0.11338681457084265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0733645083187069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058150543177605624,0.0,0.08970820615105249,0.0,0.0,0.0729888025413919,0.05300706931375939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07322662242124407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1959264683399511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608032952338128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0696054358792404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06324770568951454,0.08594316133689331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11772380459622665,0.0,0.0,0.10823620014549752,0.0,0.06106028588546227,0.06392317872016537,0.08758356880079854,0.07993158673311415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07206173771889011,0.07947021530808139,0.0,0.0614548778959572,0.0,0.14078641774251952,0.1748751450513161,0.0,0.0,0.04899186376627945,0.0,0.06069993499077825,0.08916775893383402,0.0,0.07247422715854322,0.0730598866382693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14937873885137745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09019504226861774,0.0,0.12266165543047958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329435911031648,0.07791829099961035,0.16294291896016214,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,srose89,2019/01/16,"Have you experienced death? I’m just curious. I am a 30yo female and I have had anxiety, and health-specific anxiety, since I was about 14. I attribute it to the fact that I have lost so many people in the last 30 years. I won’t go into details as to not trigger any anxiety or panic. In a nut shell, most of the death has been untimely and traumatic. I think it just manifested into anxiety for me. Anyone else have similar experiences? 

Oh and side note, some of the deaths have been due to overdoses which has made taking medicine very anxiety provoking as well. Fun stuff.

healthanxiety,chili_jones,2019/01/16,"When should I go to the doctor? Hopefully this isn’t against the rules. I keep feeling... pressure, I guess in my lower left pelvis and I keep thinking my back hurts. I’m convinced I have a bladder/kidney infection or something wrong in my ovaries... a cyst, ectopic pregnancy, something wrong anyway that will result in a lot of pain and obviously death. 

Anyways, i’m not experiencing pain as much as I am pressure and sensations if you know what I mean, but it feels so impossible to tell if it’s just manifestations of my anxiety. I’m on a tight budget and have a history with HA, so my question for you guys is do you have any ideas for “breaking point” symptopms or signs that I should wait for to see urgent care?

healthanxiety,iced_coffvee,2019/01/16,"Fear of Aneurysm had been gone for so long but now it's back Ugh - I've actually had been doing fine for the longest time, without any kind of hypochondriac fear. Recently tho I've kind of developed this weird ass hell headache, it won't happen every single time - but more often then not when I sneeze I'll get a brief shooting pain in the back of my head or feel this pressure in my head, I could cough and bend down till the cows come home without triggering it but when I sneeze it will happen. 

I've nervous about it - though I've been trying to convince myself that since I've been having a lot of tight shoulder and neck muscles its more than likely related to than than anything else, but I still can't help but get worried.",7.77405088062622,6.2194858767123335,7.092230919765169,81.36363013698633,63.52054794520548,9.9866927592955,33.870841487279854,8.418075326091056,2.430122504892368,582,19,119,6,7,180,94,146,0.244,0.727,0.029,-0.989,0,0,0,1,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,11,13,1,4,5,0,12,7,5,1,0,18,19,15,0,1,9,0,2,1,0,2,2,0,1,0,9,3,0,1,1,0,0,3,5,8,0,0,7,2,7,5,19,9,4,19,1,0,0,1,1,4,2,3,13,76,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.15527144988945432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820237580950742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309365380089749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2446963310767072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13706186149304636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12703887680548515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13291859233895228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13405966359994834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3580929855028103,0.08045237279043534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16626007300494294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2814064078413573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3265919244399573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10665016839237093,0.0,0.15960342968322638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33138365282522725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07773463187250386,0.0,0.0,0.14081010158395155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13527228216979073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16930757484104966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15710500752903542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316200146463294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12706794080415112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15632782963187405,0.0,0.18556027620140675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10802736201188322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067587337264078,0.0,0.0,0.1615870938901639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,b1tchdontkillmyvibe,2019/01/16,"My story of HIV anxiety Hi there,

For the last month and a half I've been dealing with the worst health anxiety of my life. Prior to this my health anxiety has been me thinking i'm going to have a heart attack causing me to constantly check my pulse. Things along those lines. But my current situation is far more severe. Here it is, I've posted something on here before about it.

I met a girl and we talked for months. She is a sexual person and I am not, it took me months before I finally decided I could move past just talking. After sex with a condom the first few times, we had unprotected sex the next a few times. I know how stupid this is but its even more idiotic for someone with health anxiety as i've learned. We agreed it was okay to do because i had no sexual history and she had been tested negative for stds. After the last time, 2 weeks later i got very sick. My doctor called it the worst sore throat she had seen in a long time. Along with that came chills, body aches, fatigue. I had blood work done my doctor called to say I had mono. I had only kissed this one person, and I asked her she said she had mono 4 years before. 

However, I idiotically googled symptoms. As it turns out, HIV in its early stages has all the symptoms of mono. Combine that with having unprotected sex 2 weeks before feeling sick and immediately I become overwhelmed with fear. I began to notice other things wrong with my body that resembled acute HIV - my tongue has a coating on it that i think is oral thrush, a rush formed on my chest after i started to feel better. Other things started to appear like my stomach began to growl regularly and my legs turn red in the shower. This fear hasn't gone away for a month now to the point of it keeping me up at night and sporadic panic attacks when I think about it throughout the day.

I have to take a test to put this to rest and resolve it. I know how extremely unlikely it would be for me to have this. I asked if she had been tested for stds since and she said she had been very recently. On top of this, im not sure i can ever be intimate or sexual again if this is how im going to act.

healthanxiety,formalde_heidi,2019/01/16,"Some very helpful words to put things in perspective This is an article I found that makes me feel profoundly better every time I read it. I posted it as a comment a few weeks ago, but I thought it might reach/help more people as its own post. It seems relevant to some recent posts on this sub. I'll post the url in the comments, but here it is:



""We all worry about our health from time to time, at least to some degree, but some people worry excessively about catastrophic consequences of seemingly benign symptoms. They’re known as hypochondriacs.

This is the sort of process hypochondriacs go through: what’s that? A benign lump or malignant bump on your face, breast or rump? Adrenaline rush, heart pumping, sweating, and light-headedness follow, confirming the gravity of the terminal self-diagnosis.

Thoughts racing and images of a foreshortened future, orphaned children, and opportunities missed. Overwhelming distress. Must plan the epitaph – see, I told you I was sick!

Our future and physical health are inherently uncertain. But people with hypochondriasis immediately resolve any uncertainty about novel physical sensations and symptoms on the side of catastrophe.

The body is constantly in a state of flux. The heart pumps, blood flows, muscles twitch, lungs inflate, and bowels contract. Strange symptoms come and go. And most pass without conscious awareness as we focus on daily tasks.

But try this. Hold your hand upwards, so that your palm and fingertips face the sky. Focus all your attention on the tips of your fingers and wait …and wait …until you notice some sensations. Tingling, temperature changes, or just an awareness of the sensations on your skin.

Here’s an even simpler task. As you read this, shift your attention on to the sensations of the ground or chair pushing up against your body. Chances are you were unaware of all these sensations just moments ago.

Attention, you see, is the microscope of the mind. It can filter in or out any of your internal or external experiences.

Now imagine becoming hypervigilant to all the physical changes naturally occurring in your body. Try it. Just focus on all the sensations in your body for a minute. Amazing, isn’t it? Itchy toes, tense jaw, mild headache, numbness, and so on. All the normal workings of a healthy body.

People with somatic symptom disorder are experts at searching for and noticing normal bodily changes. They’re also experts at interpreting these in potentially catastrophic ways – fatigue is leukemia; a lump on the arm is cancer.

The number one enemy of someone with the disorder is Dr Google (“cyberchondria”). Indeed, the only thing more catastrophically creative than a hypochondriac’s mind is Google’s 2.42 million webpages on the causes of cancer. Every possible symptom can be linked to every possible diagnosis, by at least one disreputable source or another.

The hypochondriac is searching not for information, but for confirmation of their imminent demise. If they’re unlucky, they might come across contradictory information or additional ailments they hadn’t yet considered.
Their intense worry and anxiety feel intolerable and must be neutralised. Seeking out a sympathetic doctor or other source of reassurance, or avoiding the health section of the newspaper all provide temporary relief until the next physical symptom is perceived.

So what are some things that keep hypochondriacs worrying?

Belief: worrying will help me catch something early.

No, it won’t. Worrying will just keep you miserable until you’re old enough to find out how you will shuffle off this mortal coil (unless, of course, your demise is a blissfully brief surprise). Worry itself will not get you any closer to predicting, preventing, or planning for your death.

Belief: I can get certainty about my health.

Nope, can’t get that either. No amount of checking, doctor visits, Googling, reassurance-seeking will guarantee with 100% certainty that you’re well. I can, however, guarantee that the unrelenting pursuit of certainty will make you miserable.

So, how can you manage health anxiety?
First, develop some healthy guidelines for monitoring your health and stick to them.
Based on your past experience, how long do benign symptoms typically last? One day, two days, one week? Decide how long you will wait before seeking any form of certainty or reassurance (from the internet, friends, family, or medical practitioners) the next time you notice a symptom, especially ones you’ve worried about in the past. Once this time expires (no pun intended), make a decision about whether you need to get the symptom checked or whether you can wait another little while before doing so. Follow guidelines from reputable sources about the recommended frequency of body checking.

And, be willing to sit with uncertainty about your health. None of us ever have certainty about our health. I could have a brain tumour as I write these words. I am willing to accept this possibility and shift my attention onto the next paragraph.

Think about it this way: if I offered you a $2 million insurance policy for your house, even if I promised to build you a gold-plated replacement if it were destroyed, you would likely consider it far too expensive.

So, how much are you willing to pay to prevent any possibility of illness? Are you willing to give up your capacity to work, time you would otherwise spend with friends and family, and ultimately your happiness? This is a very high price to pay.

Spend energy on things you truly value, rather than wasting it on a false insurance policy. Learn to accept uncertainty about your health. Revel in not knowing when or how the end will come. Focus instead on the time between now and then.

Ultimately, what you have to decide is which epitaph you would prefer when your inevitable end arrives: “lived decades in misery and fear of death”, or “didn’t see that coming but my life was far richer for it.”",7.120414780195706,9.792261582834335,6.6871866024049496,68.88309332554404,65.9061876247505,10.23710627525437,35.87220680590039,10.431916847110367,4.535886870162114,4774,237,701,134,82,1487,456,1002,0.145,0.7440000000000001,0.111,-0.9933,3,1,1,0,0,0,156.0,6,44,5,8,43,30,1,7,58,0,64,56,23,11,10,164,101,76,3,15,40,0,5,1,2,20,33,0,0,1,46,37,0,10,32,3,9,16,14,11,1,9,10,8,73,19,128,67,28,111,2,5,3,1,71,46,0,34,42,495,119,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07376552923179333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03327370689063641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147350201484254,0.08725871858355436,0.06365963785667864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04595249678692551,0.07081027042926635,0.0,0.0,0.03679867835520159,0.0,0.2773010181285995,0.0,0.04644801543918302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04274262608923899,0.13204646438626286,0.1433655879958286,0.0,0.04496320206652838,0.0,0.033220406962866225,0.0,0.0,0.053667120105208216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09537218462912324,0.08517460126701952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07370424274094814,0.042991933691499895,0.0,0.0549630599431415,0.03763659676876156,0.10516898513470498,0.0,0.0,0.0814007371950783,0.0784481774257509,0.046820292370679535,0.04207626251794898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03802873456723671,0.03539153541315975,0.0,0.04562075610325072,0.06429209708329242,0.0,0.08695333941525492,0.03991395023513231,0.04729329238995332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04429222922282063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3980438840738853,0.0,0.09861078075679247,0.08366640399562633,0.04396087791154255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04800976326602694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07396576936458256,0.0,0.0,0.02286653418273612,0.033915873892505215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029388788064462962,0.020327447556602374,0.04170190157226993,0.036740410230018825,0.07364310826305154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08332049928107023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04191543611909514,0.0,0.0882785063342244,0.08402394365498879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03058648760409534,0.030851623353985606,0.0,0.0,0.13275095941240428,0.0,0.08153353208590672,0.0,0.14211211559159054,0.04366034002226976,0.04431090147717737,0.14097245908332676,0.03164457283213073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07943862092213694,0.11538231451382487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18762596973721613,0.15939491257253693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04182728622781316,0.0,0.0,0.08323802992324021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041082638773718864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09946798202856454,0.07575627551630802,0.04340596310479766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03525411605369196,0.03203168281027752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892175018484009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11056937523438894,0.026660569556483587,0.0,0.06606382017291328,0.1698327170624238,0.0,0.0,0.039757993261914766,0.0,0.05649786930428347,0.0,0.04064473109663641,0.0,0.050049006612694485,0.0,0.0,0.06866151129829334,0.0,0.06605259897033583,0.06675046314054674,0.0,0.0374103689161306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04010839134467528,0.0,0.06058188282639852,0.3380375616637281,0.0,0.08867086676673651,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’ve visited couple doctors in these past years, i have had an ultrasound done ,a couple times and a MRI. Doctors keep saying everything is normal.

 I’m not sure if it has grown, but the size has stayed the same for at least 6 months i think?

healthanxiety,Fixer145,2019/01/16,"Dizzy after cruise Hey everyone,

I’ve been on this site for a while now, and I wanted post a question.

I got back 9 days ago from a 7 day cruise. It was wonderful! No anxiety, I felt like me again :)

However, since returning, I’ve been swaying and feeling dizzy when walking. I keep telling myself that it’s from the cruise, but it’s been 9 days!

I don’t seem to feel it when driving or anything else, but mostly when standing or walking. 

I just feel like I’m going crazy and want to cry. It’s been hard focusing on anything else, and whenever I walk, that’s all I think about.",0.3853672316384191,2.7616031864406807,2.0780000000000034,94.17575706214693,89.16949152542372,5.519548022598871,22.27344632768361,7.03164865440522,0.7686964971751418,448,17,97,7,15,146,74,118,0.13699999999999998,0.754,0.108,-0.4997,1,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,0,8,2,0,0,4,0,6,0,0,0,1,22,19,12,0,2,5,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,0,1,8,3,0,8,2,0,0,0,7,5,10,2,9,12,2,26,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,15,56,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675339824047394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14458179531336085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31105601065208616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453266325109067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20760376647077367,0.3656612966403198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157646269188169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1805942426755756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2866869077366159,0.13501912813631234,0.18146626620794346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10741105903576544,0.0,0.1511577558789895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16930372973424307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16798876158456494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18466827401616634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18100639117236064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21171931941244232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17205530362991722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15633984715194668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16519126006905607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211013175799502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22295004962491152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204958628192556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,vyshq,2019/01/16,"When can we celebrate victory and rejoice? 26M. Met my first panic attack mid-August 2018. The next five month that followed were hard and you all know how it feels.

I do remember there was a period in October and November when anxiety went away. I was happy, but happy too early, it came back knocking on my brain’s door last month. I do remember the frustration I felt because of that.

The most recent anxiety episode was on the 4th of January. I’ve been feeling well for almost 2 weeks now. I do get anxiety-typical bodily symptoms, but I have been better at ignoring or noticing very little of that. The ‘what if?...’ thing is still in my head, but I try to reassure myself it’s not logical.

My question is, when can one be sure his anxieties disappeared and are not likely to reoccur? It’s been a ‘too-good-to-be-true-twelve-anxiety-free-days’, but is this the case to celebrate a victory yet?",3.8137684729064074,5.574559982758622,5.533004926108372,77.5303448275862,72.73563218390804,10.258784893267652,29.66995073891625,10.451354775682146,3.535126108374385,703,30,131,23,14,240,115,174,0.114,0.711,0.175,0.9356,1,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,1,1,0,2,11,11,2,1,9,0,18,3,2,1,2,27,27,13,0,0,7,0,4,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,10,6,0,1,8,0,0,4,2,4,1,3,11,4,15,7,13,15,2,27,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,4,17,92,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14751413681638773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33808544088119763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16759144782361954,0.13840677006885133,0.11327571477847805,0.0,0.0898015181517472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13028765493527958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16445164007129096,0.0,0.16848847969442685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500562979660944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14897321906480587,0.0,0.14144496887962826,0.0,0.0,0.12530559138648242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696571716415737,0.0,0.0,0.12356036690842727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3136379313188814,0.13196480692463133,0.0,0.15118712045673344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08096016618882124,0.12008093420862125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07197039652907106,0.14764777445940247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2351699685585064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156670583159733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1677184716581224,0.0,0.0,0.09982408024080616,0.0,0.0,0.17284176015799152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16502589253251582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14545524197133086,0.0,0.3337570971682176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11764550581273266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13884212071305993,0.15311611371266054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09786917119613901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001683796144432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12154984487509915,0.0,0.0,0.11816676164942135,0.0,0.13245337751803699,0.13656196609567609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,CrimsonSands,2019/01/17,"Swollen lymph node, goes away as fast as it inflames \*\*Repost from AskDocs

As far as i remember, this began this past summer. One of my armpits would get a painful feeling, almost as if I pulled a muscle or so, but no lump or anything. Then a couple of days later, it would be painful and a lump and what I figure to be a lymph node. It's never more than 1 inflamed at a time under 1 armpit. It used to be just the left, but this morning I woke up with one under my right. I would say the frequency is about 1 flare up every 2 to 4 weeks, moreso on the side of a month. And no bigger than a pea, or maybe M&amp;M. I can't really tell since I touch it, but sometimes the skin appears reddish underneath, sometimes it doesn't. They eventually go down again and no pain and it feels fine. I don't ever have any symptoms of being sick, as in cough, fever, chills, etc. Everything is pretty normal beside the lymph node (if it is that) flaring up. So, something more serious to worry about and go see my PC or just let it be? Could they be cysts that flare up and then go back down? It's not the same lump either, the location changes too. I do have history of healthy anxiety (my fear is lymphoma) and i've been to the doc plenty of times this past year already and would rather not for something like this, especially when it goes away.

I should mention, not sure if this matters, but I had changed deodorants around the same time frame, from deo/antiperspirant to just a deodorant. Anyone got an idea?",5.290237829803047,5.406469508361209,5.529804905239692,85.00281586770718,67.96321070234114,8.5173541434411,29.989037532515802,8.167268648758528,1.8750199182460048,1169,40,244,14,18,371,169,299,0.14,0.81,0.05,-0.9827,0,0,2,0,0,0,48.0,0,0,2,0,14,8,0,1,19,0,25,20,3,1,3,51,37,31,0,11,19,0,4,1,0,5,17,1,0,0,20,11,0,0,5,0,0,5,10,5,0,2,5,7,17,3,41,19,6,45,0,0,2,0,5,20,0,9,21,170,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340111855239215,0.0,0.12497154899936602,0.0,0.0,0.12270373349037453,0.0,0.07701225531993185,0.0,0.08663410840848815,0.0,0.0,0.07918535906199559,0.0,0.09319313019159334,0.10081437898332292,0.0,0.0,0.2127997069266359,0.08708041844620075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396019015241048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041899813110887,0.12530632173254885,0.0,0.07303533695296048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12630101603773322,0.0,0.10243894292745703,0.09541599215380847,0.0,0.10177964577925804,0.0,0.0,0.1274350411508983,0.11452278433034065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059167199869571266,0.0,0.1930836723795012,0.0,0.09057445566519404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278427623193371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12304385497992636,0.11580334961543975,0.0,0.05532705980047585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11377244146510665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09039315844575664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734353502975971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110958608868623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153479017022775,0.0,0.3615103111288165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21621530779937334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11521352827308268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254931609910828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12828746098682606,0.09671283651607454,0.0,0.09005904149982169,0.0,0.0,0.09024367954712507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09367958972547476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743670793314609,0.2240095555946903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10673452816691743,0.11770762408367373,0.0,0.0,0.09898339899528734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1981067688368284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09780957060151534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09084039832357024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150084407849173,0.0,0.3217913995024143,0.0,0.0,0.07292774511930088

healthanxiety,Plllllluto,2019/01/17,"That one time i thought i was dying This one is a funny story, one time in the morning I went to the toilet while I was half asleep. So I did my business and I always checked my pee so when I looked into the toilet the liquid was blue and I was like ""okay, h*ly shit, I've never seen anything like this before, I am dying"" so I called my mom and I was like ""mother, my pee is blue, we need to go to the hospital."" Anyways, turns out it was just one of those toilet blue water thingies that they installed while I was asleep. At least now I can laugh about it.

healthanxiety,bboyaction,2019/01/17,"Feeling of trapped burp/excessive burping/Nausea Hello all, lately I’ve been going through a scare as someone with IBS. Lately I’ve been excessively burping. Even if I haven’t eaten anything yet, and especially once I eat something. However, the thing is sometimes I need to force the burp out because it feels like it’s trapped in my stomach or chest or throat. And when I’m unable to get the burp out, it makes me feel nauseous. For the past couple of days except yesterday, I’ve been either dry heaving or actually vomiting. When I vomit, it’s either this clear liquid that tastes like acid, which I assume is acid, and sometimes it’s food I eat. Burping helps relieve the feeling for a few minutes but then it’s back. This has been happening for a couple of weeks already. But before, I wasn’t diagnosed with IBS. I had HA about colon cancer. Once I was told that it was IBS by my GI, the burping never stopped but the nausea sort of did.

Fast forward a little bit, and I was fine. I was eating healthier and my bowel movements were even improving. I even went on a trip to Hawaii and I was fine there. I had one bout of nausea but that’s it. And then shit hit the fan right when I got back from Hawaii. Basically whatever I said in the beginning lol. But here’s a list of all my symptoms/medical issues:

-Excessive burping
-feeling like a burp is trapped in stomach/chest/throat
-Nausea (due to reason above)
-Occasional acid when I burp and in the morning when I wake up (making me think it’s possibly GERD but I don’t have heartburn and this feeling is only occasional)
-dry heaving/vomiting clear liquid/food. No red blood or coffee grounds or green or yellow liquid.
-mild IBS, no abdominal pain, predominantly constipation (although it has been getting better. I’ve been having nice BM every day. But yesterday it was diarrhea which is weird)
-sometimes blood on the toilet paper, but this always happens when I have to strain and it hurts and itches. GI says I have internal hemorrhoids.
-BM are usually 4-5 on the Bristol stool chart
-Swollen turbinate and a deviated septum (ah my first bout of my HA. If I could go back in time I would prevent this lol).
-Fatigue
-some skin patches that idk if it’s eczema or psoriasis. Leaning towards eczema since I have an intense family history of it.

I’ve had no weight loss, thankfully. I actually gained weight in Hawaii haha. So it’s basically the burping, nausea that is making my HA spike. And it sucks because it makes me anxious that I have some deadly colon/stomach disease again, and I’ve considered making an appointment with my GI to see if I can get an endoscopy/colonoscopy, which he was very reluctant to do since I’m 22 years old. This burping and nausea is just so annoying and depressing. I had to go home from work because of it. I’ve been combating the vomiting well so far. Breathing sort of helps with nausea, as well as chewing gum and ginger ale. However, they haven’t been as effective as before. My mind is going through so many possibilities of what this could be: hiatal hernia, GERD, postnasal drip from my nose problems, a general IBS flare up, a stomach ulcer, my stupid anxiety, or something worse. It’s just so fucking scary. The only thing that makes me feel better is sleep. Please, the best advice and/or reassurance.

healthanxiety,Zeuseh,2019/01/17,"Muscle Twitch Around Knee Hey guys, only just discovered this subreddit today amidst another day of google searches - loved the ""Health Anxiety Starter Pack"" post!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I'm asking for here, more just a bit of advise/guidance I guess.  I've always had some mild HA since my late teens and get abnormally anxious at the sign of any lump, bump or anomaly on my body.  Like a lot of others, the illness that puts the fear of death in to me is ALS/MND (from the UK).  I go through phases but over the past 6 or 7 years i've always tried to convince myself that i'm showing symptoms for it.  However, I'm 30 now and around 5 weeks ago I started to get a distinct muscle twitch just above my left knee (like lower right of the thigh).  It was fairly consistent, clearly visible but painless.  For context, I work in fairly stressful sales job, get a bit blue during Christmas/New Year in any case and had a lot to drink over the Christmas period with numerous nights out etc.  This seemed to compound the issue and really flare up my HA.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the turn of the year it's continued in the exact same location &amp; really seems to kick in when I pay attention to it.  However, when I play sports, workout and find myself away from my own thoughts it doesn't seem to impact me as much.  Recently it's started to impact my sleep and my work which is quite rare for me and very concerning.  I've read in and around 200 google articles and I can't help but feel everyone of them can't discount the likes of MS &amp; ALS etc. I feel like the twitches have became a bit more regular but they're just as isolated.  I've been to a physio, they claimed it may be a circulation issue and basically battered my left thigh to help....it didn't.  I've been to the docs and given blood - they came back fine.  I've got a follow up with her on the 25th and my plan is get a referral to a neurologist....although that scares the shit out of me.  The doc did mention it was unlikely but to me that just translates to ""there's still a chance"".

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to convince myself that this is stress induced and i'm in a viscous struggle - I'm trying to run more and improve times to prove to myself that my muscles aren't degrading &amp; are actually improving....although all this does is make runs far more stressful than they used to be!  I've became a right pain in the arse at home and my negative outlook is having a bit of impact at home with my fiance (also getting married this year).  

&amp;#x200B;

Any guidance on how I should proceed with docs/consultants or any hints or tips to stem my worrying would be massively appreciated.

healthanxiety,Jamieleee_xoxo,2019/01/17,"CLEAR STUFF ON EYE This has happened to me a few times in the last couple of months but it went away. So I notice when I wake up my right eye feels like something is in it. It’s very annoying, it feels like a eyelash is stuck in it. I look and there’s a clear string like gunk on the white part of my eye. I looked it up and I seems very similar to a cyst? 

Has anyone ever experience this?
I have no health insurance so I’m hoping it resolves on it’s own.

With no triggers or life circumstances to speak of, my brain started telling me I need to take deeper breaths than I am capable of taking. The next day I hyperventilated so hard that my hands went numb and curled up tight. I am 24 and until recently I figured I had managed to evade young adult mental illness.

healthanxiety,___HER___,2019/01/18,"The grand old duke of hypochondria, he had 10,000 symptoms, and when he was only half way dead he was suddenly fine again! Ever feel like every day is an uphill struggle? You’re master and commander of a rebellious army of terrible thoughts that you spend all day corralling into a manageable format only for them to break ranks out of the blue and leave you exhausted and all out of battle plans? 

You would concede, surrender, wave your white flag, if you could. But when you’re fighting yourself, there’s no one to give in to, only a brief respite of broken sleep, spinning the roulette wheel of anxiety, will you wake up tomorrow with a new symptom or be granted a brief moment of peace? You pray for the latter and prepare for the former. 

Monday you wake up with nausea, the stomach cancer is back again. But, you also had abnormally painful cramps on your last period, so the logical explanation is that these symptoms are linked. The ovarian cancer from November is back and spreading, you were bloated last Friday too, if all makes sense when you put the pieces together. 

Pace the floor a little as you wait for the toaster to pop. Will I make a coffee? Hmm, the caffeine won’t help the nausea. Just stick to water and down your multivitamins, your antidepressants, the liquid iron for the self diagnosed anaemia. 

Palms are sweating, hands are jittery, a headache is setting in. Oh god, is this the blood pressure dropping or hypoglycaemia setting in? Only I could contract diabetes 15 minutes after learning of my terminal cancer diagnoses. 

The toaster pops, makes me jump a mile, heart racing.  Better check my pulse... great, a heart attack induced from the stress of my diabetes and cancer double blow. 

Dr google is ready to see you now.

“Nausea abdominal pain” *search* 

What is this, amateur hour? I’ve been coming to this doctor for 15 years, I know better than to be so vague with my symptoms. Better be more specific. 

“Nausea, shakiness, headache, sweating, dry mouth....”

No, no no. I’ll just be told it’s anxiety again. Far better to type in what I know it is and confirm my hunch with the list of symptoms that comes up. 

For the 300th time in a decade you search for heart failure, kidney infection, four different types of cancer, Parkinson’s, M.S, stomach ulcers, all the time internally scanning your body meticulously for developing symptoms... you’re so good at this now that you can feel the tiniest disturbance in your body, a twinge in your arm, the blurry vision when you look at a particular angle in a certain direction, is that a post nasal drip coming on? 

And the day speeds on, leaving you in the dust, an exhausted heap of worry and fear. The hours pass, commitments left to the wayside as you forge on in the pursuit of truth about your terminal condition. You’re grumpy, snappy, why are people trying to talk to you when you are clearly on the cusp of finding out without doubt you have 6 days left to live? 

Typing away on your phone or laptop, a partner or a parent curiously asking what you are up to “are you on Facebook, honey?”  You are short with them, you’re busy. Weighing up whether to tell them the truth, you’re dying again, knowing you will be met with rolling eyes or a speech about how you’re fine, to stop worrying. So instead you keep quiet, they think you’re in another mood, you’re always so moody. 

The night draws in and you’re done. You’ve scoured the forums, the articles, the YouTube videos. You still feel like crap, noticing you’ve a sore throat and swollen glands. Great, HIV too.

Until, just before bed you do what you always do. Find the others like you, wrap yourself in the thin fraying blanket of comfort that comes when you accept there are others all over the world who are dying today, who receive new terminal diagnoses every other week,  those poor souls who receive crushing news of an incurable illness like most people receive spam email.

Health anxiety. A seemingly uninstallable app rooted in your brain with new and exciting updates every day.

Your foe, your enemy, your captor. 

Tuesday and Wednesday go off without a hitch, you have no symptoms, you’re healthy for a couple days. Wednesday you caught norovirus from that person on the bus. Thursday it was gone but you woke up with Leukemia, how you managed to trudge into work after that blow was a miracle. Friday you were cured, Saturday the pinnacle of health, Sunday the cancer was back. 

And so the cycle continues. Held captor to a cruel brain (one with a tumour in it) that is so over sensitive to every bodily function, every twinge, that in its effort to inform your of your terrible illness, it’s slowly killing your soul day after day. 

 There’s hope for us yet. Once I went a whole month without silently battling a terrible incurable disease. One day that will be a couple months, then a year, and I’ll live like all the normal healthy people all around me. One day.

healthanxiety,throwaway06601,2019/01/18,"Stressing a little of medication side effect Hi! I've been having issues with constantly feeling like I need to pee and not emptying my bladder for a few months now (although all medical tests have indicated there's nothing (at least structurally) wrong). I am a male. I was prescribed 0.4 mg Tamsulosin HCl (aka Flomax), which relaxes the muscles in the pelvic area, and muscle tension and anxiety are suspected to be the cause. I read through the booklet I got with the medicine and I just have concerns about the fact that one of the side effects is retrograde ejaculation (where semen enters the bladder instead of leaving the body...sorry for putting that image in everyone's heads). It itself is not a serious symptom, and I know even if it does happen, it will go away when I stop taking the medicine. I'm only taking it short term, too. I guess basically does anyone else also get stressed out about side effects? Any mental tips on how to stop being so crazy about it? Of course I know rationally that my doctor decided the benefit much outweighs potential risks, and that they always put every possible side effect because that's just legalese and what not. It's ridiculous because I know this medicine was given to me to HELP me! But this crazy irrational side of me can't just relax and take it..

healthanxiety,DarkMountain666,2019/01/18,"Can a lot of strenuous intense exercise after each other in a day cause heart damage? It was more than a week ago where my heartrate was high all day. For some reason I  believe I damaged my heart without feeling any significant pain. This kind of thinking is fucking scary. It sends you right down the rabbit hole of anxiety. My heart was tested extensively almost a complete year ago and it turned out well.

But then I rationalize that something bad happened and my perception of my beating heart becomes clearer and clearer and I feel it more and more.

I don't know what to fucking do now. I am too lazy to go to a doctor again, to test myself for the so manyth (&lt;-- not a word) time. But I have to.. Or not? Or do I.. I might die if I won't.. I'm fucking scared. Normal people won't go to the doctor when they feel nothing.. Or do they? What if my body is suffering in silence? Oh my fucking God.

healthanxiety,mmceach1016,2019/01/18,"Have diverticulitis, now anxiety? I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in September.  Unfortunately, the infection spread through a hernia in my groin area and I developed an abscess in my groin.  I was hospitalized for ten days for treatment.  Last time I had been to the hospital was at birth 38 years before, so this was a shock.  I wasn't treated poorly or anything, just being away from my family, from work, from life, seemed to get me down.  I have a five year old and I face time'd with her while in the ER the first night and you could see the fear in her eyes.  She had only been in the hospital prior to visit great aunts, who would go on to pass away.  The look on her face is seared in my head and basically impossible to shake.  A fearful look because I'm sure she thought, when I see people in the hospital, I some times don't see them much longer after that.

It was a bit of a tough recovery, every ache, spasm, etc sent me into a panic.  Feeling my groin to see if I could feel a bulge from a returning abscess.  Pressing my lower abdomen to see if I was in pain from a recurrence of diverticulitis.  Sleepless night staring at my phone on healthline or Mayo Clinic.   Recently, I started having this bubble sensation in the sternum area near my chest, it would come out of nowhere and almost ""pop"" and be gone.  No rapid heartbeat, blood pressure normal, but the more I worried, the more they'd come along, mostly all at night, when my mind has more opportunity to wander.  One night was so bad I did go to the ER, they hooked me to an EKG, did a chest xray, blood tests.  Nothing really, no heart attack.  Was home in bed within a few hours.

My PCP suggested a holter monitor EKG which I wore for a day this week.  No results yet as the doctor has been out, but I'm guessing if it was anything truly pressing I'd have known by now.  I think folks here understand my predicament and I just needed to say it out loud to someone other than my wife.  She herself has had anxiety issues in the past and says it's probably a post traumatic anxiety.

Are these types of sensations normal for those of you who might struggle with health related anxiety?

healthanxiety,Mrsparker9619,2019/01/18,"How I overcame health anxiety (read this is your currently struggling) So, i have been wanting to post this here but have been putting it off because this is going to be long so bare with me. If you want to know how I over came this bad disease keep reading, If your ready to recover keep reading. 

It all started when I was 16. Nothing necessarily trigger this other then I got sick one time (fever, body aches), and it had been a few years since I had a check up when my mom said “you need to let me take you to the doctor for a check up because you won’t know if somethings wrong of you don’t”. So when I got sick I decided to google it to see what was wrong, and leukemia was the first thing that popped up. My heart dropped. From that moment I was a google fanatic and thought I had every disease in the book. I suddenly started experiencing symptoms of leukemia like fatigue, and flu like symptoms. 

The after that I was worried I had a brain tumor. I had symptoms of that also, this was the worst one for me I think. I had a buzzing noise in my ear from time to time, blurred vision, fuzzy peripheral vision, headaches, pressure on the top of my head, slurred speech sometimes, nausea at time, etc. it was HORRIBLE. The symptoms were real. I was checked multiple times and I got a clean bill of health. 

Then I worried about skin cancer. I seen a dermatologist who confirmed I do NOT have skin cancer. 

I then found what I thought to be a lump in my abdomen and seen a doctor who said it’s nothing but she ordered a CT with contrast to shut me up. That was clear as well BUT did say I had a very slightly enlarged spleen which could have been caused by mono when I was younger. 

I had many blood panels, EKGS, echocardiograms, CT scans, X-rays, urine tests, I saw a chiropractor, a dermatologist, and many MDs before I finally decided to accept that this was a mental issue and I’m NOT ill. It took me 5 long frustrating, scary, years before I agreed I had an issue with worrying over my health for no good reason. I seen two counselors and they helped, but I knew the change had to be within me! 

I finally accepted the facts. Google is not the most reliable source. In fact, only 42% of the health info found on google IS accurate. So your pretty much seeking reassurance from a uneducated stranger rather then just seeing your dr and trusting their diagnosis. It’s hard to agree these symptoms are in your head, but they ARE! You can make yourself feel all sorts of crazy symptoms, so if you’ve seen a doctor and you have a good report, the only thing you should be googling is Health Anxiety symptoms and making sure your on a reliable website, such as webMD or Mayoclinic. Steer clear of yahoo answers, or any of the other forums that uneducated people  post on trying to give advice. In facts, steer clear of google and the web PERIOD! 

Here’s how I done it:

I scheduled a check up and wrote down ALL of my concerns. I talked to my doctor about my issues with anxiety and how bad I was making myself worry. He told me I need to stay FAR AWAY from google all together and I followed his orders. I had him do a full check up, ekg, blood work, STD testing, you name it just to at last, put my mind at ease. Once that was over and I was confirmed healthy, I started finding stuff to do like working out, surrounding myself with friends, and I got a job! I would leave my phone in the car locked up when I went into work. For a period of time I only used my phone for calls and texts. When i did have the urge to google I’d find something else to do. Like go for a walk and talk to myself about all the tests I’ve had. After ALL of these test, it would be very unlikely something so sinister would be missed! I knew it was mental so I would be easy on myself. Cry if need be. But don’t check for lumps, don’t start Letting your mind wonder, keep yourself occupied at least for the first few weeks. I would set new goals for myself (like school, work, gym). Find someone you trust and talk to them about your problems. Like for me, it was my mother. Work on IMPROVING your health. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, get a good amount of exercise each week, and take a supplement. And most of all remind yourself this is a mental thing when you start to worry and IMMEDIATELY distract yourself. Please keep in mind this is a process, it didn’t get this bad over night so it will not be fixed over night, it will take time. Be patient with yourself. Talk to a counselor if you need to. 
🛑STOP POSTING QUESTIONS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS! 🛑 because you won’t find them here, unless your looking for ways to over come anxiety. 

If you believe in God, pray often. If you need medication, take it.

Personally I never wanted meds because I don’t want to be dependent on them. But if it helps you, take it. If you need a break from work. Take it. Put you first. 

If your scared to see a doctor make the appointment and MAKE yourself go for reassurance. Remember, if (god forbid) something is wrong, It’s better to find out  and take care of it then ignore it and it get worse (like, high blood pressure for instance, if you don’t take meds it can potentially eventually damage arteries) but it’s better to fix the problem and move on then to not do anything at all. But no matter what Google is not the answer. 

If anyone needs to talk or has questions feel free to ask me! I am pretty educated in the health field as I’ve done many heard of research as well as school
For registered nursing. I have family in the medical field, so if you feel you need to confide in someone done hesitate to DM me and we can work though this together, I don’t want to see anyone waste years of their life like I did if I can help it!

healthanxiety,tourist25,2019/01/18,"Anyone ever had lung/chest sounds? Would really appreciate your insight. I read a lot of the posts here and I nod along and think, ‘Yeah, that’s me.’ But this is my first time posting, as I’m looking for some input and would be grateful for your thoughts. 

2018 was a busy year for me. I got married (and I’m very happy aside from the crippling HA) I run my own business and I’m fully self-employed. I lost 20 pounds doing a 10 week intense gym course and I got, wait for it, 8 colds.  HA nightmare.

I’m a 31 year old male and healthy (except for that undiagnosed illness that changes every month but is surely secretly killing me) but getting the cold 8 times last year really set my HA on a spiral. 

That’s not the only “illness” I had last year. I had mouth ulcers and sore throats that I thought were somehow HIV. I had a sore on my tongue that at the time had to have been tongue cancer. I had a pain in my lower back which radiated into my testicles and down my left leg, which of course had to have been testicular cancer (saw the doc twice about this - no meds given) You all know the story, all of these things cleared up and I moved onto the next killer.

Anyway, I went and got my bloods tested yesterday and I’m awaiting results next week. I did this because I got so many colds last year and also I want to see what’s slowly “killing me”. 

But my new symptom scares me. It a sound when I breathe deep. Like a bubbling or a mild rattling. Only sometimes, maybe around ten breathes a day, some days less, some days none. I am getting over a series of colds, as I mentioned. And I also have a tickley cough. It’s not chesty. And sometimes I cough of clear snot with it (sorry) 

I had this exact same episode Summer 2018 with the sounds etc and it all cleared up but has returned after a winter cold and it just won’t go away. Obviously I’m thinking lung cancer or that I’ll need a lung transplant etc 

I went to the doc, but because the sound/sensation is only there sometimes, he listened and said my lungs sound Chrystal clear. I wanted a chest x ray but he said he didnt see grounds for one at that point (a month ago)

Has anyone had any breathing sounds with anxiety? Like deep in your chest? 

Has anyone had stress/anxiety cause extra mucus that could maybe cause such a thing?

Would really love some input on this. 

Thanks in advance! 

TL:DR: Having sounds in my lungs every so often when taking a deep breath. Anyone have this and live to tell the tale?

healthanxiety,plantliiiife26,2019/01/18,"I don’t wanna be like this anymore I’ve been dealing with health anxiety ever since my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Every time I have some symptom, I google for hours until i’ve convinced myself I have days left to live and have to go to the doctor right away. I saw my doctor yesterday and I could tell he thought I was insane and told me to stop googling stuff. It’s honestly so embarrassing and I feel like I have no control over myself anymore. He referred me to a psychologist within the first like 5 minutes of us talking. I’m just embarrassed and everyone around me is so annoyed with me constantly thinking I have some issue. I wish I could just get over this.

healthanxiety,dinosaurcookiez,2019/01/18,"Healthy Anxiety + Anxiety about doctors/dentists/medical stuff in general I'm constantly worried about random ""symptoms"" I'm feeling or seeing in myself. I'm constantly thinking ""I should go see a doctor and hopefully catch something before it gets too bad...""

...but then I also have lots of anxiety about hospitals, clinics, doctors, medicine, medical procedures, etc.

So then it becomes a battle between the anxieties, and I only make it to the doctor when my fear that I'm dying of something I haven't been diagnosed with yet surpasses my fear of doctors, medicines, and medical procedures. 

Does anyone have tips for navigating this messy tangle of anxiety?

healthanxiety,Mike-DiBlasi,2019/01/19,"Is this health anxiety?! Or something else Hello all, if you take time to read and respond to my post I thank you.

To begin ive been dealing with health issues since early September (about 4 months now). Could possibly be lyme or something else but the results were not very cut and dry. Ever since these health issss started ive been weighed down by “brain fog” or at least thats how I describe it to doctors. Ive read a bit about brain fog on here but my symptoms seem a bit different, could this still be alk anxiety (most of my doctors have labled this as my issue)

My symptoms of what i call “brain fog” is mainly visual, things look and seem a bit “off/weird” not exactly blurry but just off. This feeling has been with me before (when i had mono 2 years ago) but it only lasted about 3 weeks, this time has been about 3 months constantly. My other symptoms are daily headaches, dizzy/unstable feeling, a feeling or fuzzy/congestion in my head (not really in sinuses but in head) and just feeling out of it.

I read a lot on this reddit about not being able to remember things or think clearly/concentrate. I dont have these issues, mine seem to be mainly visual paired with headaches. Is this being caused by my health anxiety? If not do you have any ideas?

Ive had an MRI, two CT scans and tons of bloodwork done in the last three months. All normal except my lyme came back positive. However after antibiotic treatment and still seeing strange results from bloodwork we are thinking it could be a false positive.  I definitely have anxiety about my health (been a rough few months) but I feel like of it was anxiety it wouldn’t be causing these constant all day symptoms!  Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks all! Any feedback is amazing.",4.787710843373496,6.411582686746987,5.014501204819278,82.7642337349398,70.02409638554218,7.962602409638554,29.243855421686746,8.488131031819089,2.176711180722891,1380,53,256,22,25,434,174,332,0.03,0.8270000000000001,0.14300000000000002,0.9907,2,0,2,0,0,0,42.0,1,3,0,0,16,6,1,0,10,0,40,20,5,5,6,63,58,22,0,7,21,0,6,1,0,1,14,0,0,0,21,12,1,0,12,3,0,1,7,1,0,2,11,9,28,5,36,36,14,36,0,0,3,0,9,10,0,12,25,178,49,6,0.07077929561701357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274157498615872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14439704443510726,0.0,0.2707298370778197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054424909384300786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0602279674286285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23181797741080234,0.0,0.0,0.23703930608117005,0.07227357442463224,0.08095265836636366,0.0,0.1454196673059312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529745475131224,0.0,0.16953452455944987,0.0,0.0,0.045646790247942035,0.07297034587269981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739492993146299,0.0,0.1448912164791353,0.0,0.07243179346276257,0.08295280732645244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11825403857434318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06402392507673639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17894069271920654,0.05056474293116647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07803442329062138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14527995426067158,0.37617540725903853,0.0,0.0,0.047441869888565205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07990120946613563,0.0,0.2216255867575516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11538914542922125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034579188638155484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059436782097176115,0.0,0.0,0.060174026042021336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22598143395052506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06934868183728111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05383084375395115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07979302102359569,0.06778699999668471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21239534849882893,0.0,0.04534302917970455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08017914433499887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056401934780464374,0.1933044373358854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11709872949490595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897871945898974,0.0,0.0,0.05009794973675746,0.0,0.11304887381818088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2942671562173589,0.05321722171197052,0.0,0.0,0.13032813181175376,0.0,0.0,0.09404523792735324,0.09070502937737274,0.0,0.0,0.08254395293259655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06914108718392432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058400331491529726,0.0,0.0,0.05677488160267105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0455795457869955
healthanxiety,daydaylin,2019/01/19,"Fast Heartbeat for 2 hours I hope somebody can help. I had a jog earlier today, then took a hot shower. Ever since the shower, my heartrate has been around 80-90 bpm (even 100? not sure) for 2 hours. I have no other symptoms. 

I know 80-90 is still considered a normal heart rate, but it isn't for me. Mine is usually around 50-60. Of course, I'm really worried about some kind of heart trouble.

healthanxiety,georgejefferson11,2019/01/19,"Body extremely heavy, and so much more :( My body has been SO heavy for over a week. My dr said it’s anxiety most likely but I’m afraid something is wrong because I kept having rib pains, stomach issues, random pains in my head, joint pains, just really weird and random shit. I also have been dealing with tmj like symptoms (head pressure,stiff neck issues, minor back issues, ear ringing) I’m just afraid something is wrong no matter how many times people say it’s anxiety. I also have allergies and sometimes they make my stomach upset, throat itchy, hives ect and now I’m afraid anytime I get a small hive or itchy spot my throat is going to close up (I get hives a lot and have for years... and my throat has never closed up,..) I got anxiety medication but I’m like hesitant to take it as needed. I also keep gagging randomly especially after food. My chest aches some but it doesn’t feel like an anxiety ache it is almost like a muscle ache? Idk just weird shit. 
I’m just freaking myself out so much and everyone is sick of me!!!
I’m afraid of having MS or spinal issues, nerve issues, cancer, brain aneurisms.  Ugh help.
I’m starting Zoloft tonight btw.

healthanxiety,arse9k,2019/01/19,"EKG changes and CT? Greeting, my anxious friends.  


I'll cut right to the chase!

&amp;#x200B;

From April 2018 - November 18th, I went to the hospital 14 times or so, each time with the same symptoms; feeling of rapid heartbeat, chest pain, profuse sweating and feeling of impending doom. Each time I had an EKG and bloodwork done and the results have always been perfectly normal. I've also had a Holter done in addition to several other monitors during admission.  


When I went to the hospital on November 13th my EKG was perfectly normal. When I went to the hospital again on November 18th, I suddenly had inverted Ts in my ST-segment, which they said could be indicative of insufficient oxygen to the heart muscle. From November 18th - present, I've had additional EKGs done which show the same change, but the doctors say that the EKGs, even with the change, is still perfectly normal. Some say there is no ischemia and that my heart is perfectly healthy, others say that they aren't concerned at all and that they don't suspect anything.  
I also had an extensive ultrasound done in November, which shows nothing abnormal. Valves are fine, no endocarditis, no extra sounds. Heart monitor during admission shows nothing abnormal either.  


Still, I am scheduled for a CT on January 22nd to rule out any atherosclerosis/blockages and I am scared to death of the pre-op medication they want to give me to lower my heart rate to between 40-50BPM.  


My question to the community is: Have you heard of depression/anxiety causing changes in your EKG? If you Google it, there is one article out of Columbia University that specifically mentions ST-inversions in patients with depression/anxiety.

healthanxiety,ClinicallyMiserable,2019/01/20,"Do you obsess about/only seem to have symptoms for ONE particular problem? I see a lot of users posting about how they experience symptoms for different diseases/problems. I, on the other hand, am focused on one specific issue and the symptoms surrounding that. I rarely consider myself to have something new weekly or monthly. So, when I see posts telling me to write down my symptoms that inevitably come and go, I can’t relate because I’ve had the same problems and concerns for a loooong time. It makes me think maybe this isn’t just anxiety.

healthanxiety,GoldlessDragon,2019/01/20,"65mg of elemental iron a day for the last week in preparation for donating blood. Now I’m worried that I’m gonna die from iron toxicity. I’m a 20 year old female who typically has lower than normal iron. Not concerningly low, just on the low end of average. Our college is hosting a blood drive in a few days so I bought some iron supplements about a week ago because I once told the nurse that I’m often rejected due to low iron and the nurse said that a lot of people take iron supplements about a week before they donate. Well the supplements I bought are 65mg of elemental iron per pill. I started taking them before researching a safe dose because I didn’t think you could OD on iron (yes very dumb). After taking one pill a day for about a week I found out that the maximum safe dosage before toxicity occurs is 45mg a day. So now I’m worried that I’m going to die of iron toxicity",5.113386613386613,5.219606582417583,6.74734265734266,76.15674825174827,68.34065934065934,10.134665334665335,29.182817182817182,10.018931242160765,2.626345054945056,706,23,145,16,11,245,99,182,0.102,0.821,0.077,-0.7475,1,1,0,0,0,0,11.0,1,1,2,0,10,8,1,0,17,1,6,5,2,0,0,13,24,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,6,2,0,2,2,0,4,2,2,5,1,1,6,1,10,3,21,16,3,28,0,4,0,0,7,8,1,3,18,73,16,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12250042373455584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1684832580931808,0.0,0.3527781155783379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11033646669294198,0.0,0.0,0.35649415232109644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868465948795922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12239864691310648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1515223170480647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853869439974842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11264635301684912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11748738678600255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13540053644451785,0.0,0.0,0.14501109688555286,0.14717183658935484,0.09364366338832827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958061479841274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13145390497585915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09781424952018088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3117135110712648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08854897678321556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13205005297572026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402431889108867,0.0,0.0,0.44340277115075655,0.0,0.1242527801811486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2806849281314105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08899224595122619
healthanxiety,teethingcats,2019/01/20,Perineum feels hard after a bowel movement. Should I be worried? I’m a 24 y/o female with digestive issues. My doctor think it’s just diet/IBS causing my constipation and upset stomach. I recently had a BM that made a inner hemorrhoid (I assume) pop out. My doctor told me not to worry and gave the same advice. It’s gone back since then but I noticed after some BMs my perineum (gooch area) feels harder. I can still squish it and it doesn’t feel like there’s something underneath but it’s harder. ,1.3234144427001588,3.9737521734693884,3.2438775510204114,85.2324411302983,88.48979591836735,5.056200941915228,20.80376766091052,6.67199483983844,0.7574715855572998,395,13,70,5,13,132,72,98,0.053,0.89,0.057,0.3298,1,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,1,5,0,5,5,2,2,0,19,14,6,0,1,4,0,4,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,6,5,1,0,5,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,5,4,10,1,6,7,2,12,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,2,7,45,16,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20709824885711506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16296321738080827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21771333312919705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4338443384615002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32147872732279537,0.15140481237940845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898501330098076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22120274876891927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10353964569975373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20053591016186856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24128686196374804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20925804143374685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17531297640708038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1631561995232307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16924978293121376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13579796077916148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025108427710492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4304560283627805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Thalana,2019/01/20,"Sudden painful lump in buccal mucosa area sort of behind wisdom tooth, should I be freaking out? On Friday after finishing a week long dose of antibiotics I began to feel discomfort when moving my jaw. I felt around yesterday and noticed a raised area or lump at the very back of my upper mouth, deep on the side of my wisdom tooth, in the buccal mucosa area as they call it. It's on the lining of the cheek in a weird sort of muscular pocket that moves when you move your jaw, hence the pain.

Would cancer grow this quickly? I'm quite sure this lump wasn't there before. Salt water rinses do burn a little as though it's an ulcer or something, but I don't typically get mouth ulcers so I'm unsure.

healthanxiety,nicduersch,2019/01/20,"Love yourself—Take care of yourself. Historically, for me.. January-March is the hardest time for year for me.

My Anxiety journey began two years ago, in February. One of my best friends passed from a Brain Tumor, the month before. I went to his funeral and they talked about all the symptoms he had.... next thing I know, I’m consumed by constantly looking for the same symptoms. Then they start to appear.... One day, I’m fine. The next day I have a pain in my neck and googled it and was convinced it was cancer and I was going to die and leave my young wife and daughter. Then I had a full blown panic attack on Valentine’s Day and ended up in the ER, convinced I was having a heart attack.

Since then, it has been on and off struggles with a brain tumor fear—my longest battle. But every January, the anxiety comes back with a vengeance. I know this is the case for a lot of people... the bad weather, the dark days with not a lot to do, it takes a toll. 

Remember. Take care of yourself. Excercise, hell even just go on a walk. Distract yourself. Don’t seclude yourself. Don’t google. Eat your greens. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. 

We’re all fighting the same battle. We’re all constantly battling with the very real symptoms that our bodies have. The very real fear of passing before your time, or having a terminal disease. I care about each and every one of you. Hang in there. And let’s fight the good fight every day.

healthanxiety,Herman-Toothrot,2019/01/20,"Eyelids twitching for many months? Just wondering how many people here have had their eyelids twitching for many months (or longer)?  If you finally got it to go away, what did you do?

I see a lot of posts where people are stressing about eyelids twitches they’ve had for days or weeks (or sometimes hours).  But mine have twitched to varying degrees since last May or so.  I have tried several bouts of destressing, improving my sleep, meditating, exercising, eating bananas, drinking tonic water, taking multivitamins, ... but can’t seem to get them to stop twitching.

I also notice if I blink hard, sneeze, look certain directions, etc that they’ll start twitching.  If I partially close my eyes then the muscles around my eyes quiver like they’re straining to hold the position.  Which leads me down the path of thinking it’s more than stress / anxiety and something more in my muscles or nervous system.  Especially since it has lasted this long, through many periods of low stress.

healthanxiety,deanfmc96,2019/01/21,"Tunnel vision when going cross-eyed?  My friend found this 'thing' you can do with your eyes, so I tried it and now I'm abit freaked (more than abit), wondering if anyone can explain it. So this doesn't seem to work inside, only in bright sunlight as far as I've noticed. If you stand outside, in the sunlight(bright) and get in a spot where your side vision is showing the blue sky or something you can clearly see and isn't crowded/moving - then begin by putting your finger infront of your face in-line with your nose, slowly move it in until it's touching the tip of your nose (so you're now crossed-eyed), you'll notice the 'sides' of your vision in each eye have a tunnel-vision kind of effect and go black, once you stop being cross-eyed, it dissapears. why? Going crossed-eyed straight away also does this. can someone please explain this or atleast go out of your way to try and do it just so I'm not so alarmed. you know how HA can be :(",4.892588652482266,5.392188968085108,4.705106382978721,89.23333333333332,68.8936170212766,6.692198581560284,27.368794326241137,5.46131890053228,0.8068602836879433,738,22,153,2,12,226,114,188,0.038,0.83,0.132,0.9409,0,0,1,0,0,0,31.0,0,14,0,2,12,6,0,1,6,1,14,6,6,2,1,25,29,21,0,2,6,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,11,9,0,1,7,1,0,6,3,2,0,0,1,10,16,4,21,25,2,28,0,0,6,0,17,13,0,6,7,92,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446732174480342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264960899853671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16997037833203896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15831507405532522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19835786825803484,0.13977018809615693,0.0,0.09451771801683444,0.0,0.41126002559640334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1883893474062904,0.09942309953547274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19227810930229872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4119332033660109,0.0,0.19266265420310333,0.0,0.13758978467413674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19858424403229635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1818639592993613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14416140488377904,0.16469316383724375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15328398529618886,0.13927292885247575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512483962347755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1201881963358853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2456512752869563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14359749644444286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1632426350447698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961885755371968,0.13170423025547132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,stardust1283,2019/01/21,"This is ruining my life. I need to make a change. Title says it all. This is ruining my life and making me feel like life isn't even worth living. All I do is obsess and worry and browse the internet. I'm 27 F, and in the past week I have gone from worrying about brain tumours to MS to early onset Parkinsons to liver cancer, blood cancer, Meneire's disease, diabetes, and other illnesses. 

I've been like this my whole life. I don't even know why, but ever since I've been a kid I've been worried about my health. I was a semi sick child, but nothing life threatening or horrible. I have been seeing a therapist off and on since I've been 14 and it does help, though I haven't gone in a few weeks. 

2 months ago I began getting vertigo. Doctor told me it was an inner ear problem, and the whole thing made my anxiety completely spiral out of control. I haven't stopped thinking about whats wrong with me or worried about not being dizzy for longer than 15 minutes in the last 10 weeks. The room spinning vertigo is gone, I'm just left with some random dizzy spells and disequilibrium/unsteadiness. I was convinced the doctor missed something, so they agreed to do some blood work and booked an MRI. They don't seem overly concerned but said they will do it. I'm waiting for the MRI, but just got news back from my bloodwork. Apparently it's all normal expect for my B12, which is elevated (cut off is 950 and I'm 1048).. This is pretty unusual, since B12 is normally low if anything. I have been taking B12 supplements, so I'm going to try to assume that's what caused it (the nurse told me about the blood results and the doctor has yet to follow up, so I don't know what to do about it besides stop taking the supplement) but of course my crazy self went on Google and found out high B12 can be indicative of blood or liver cancers and is really serious. Cue freak out. 

I'm just done. I'm so done living like this. I don't know what the follow up will be for the B12, if anything, but I'm just going to be sitting here wanting to browse the internet in hopes of making myself feel better when in reality I never will. I will sit here and think about every bodily sensation and worry about feeling off balance, and worry about something sinister going on and picturing all the horrible scenarios that are going to happen and how I'm going to die young and suffer and leave my children motherless. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just have to make a change. Even if I do have blood cancer or liver cancer (my current fear), there isn't anything I can do about it. It's not like worrying is going to make it go away, so why do I do this to myself? I can't do another day like this, searching for answers and being constantly scared. I've booked an appointment with my psychologist for this Wednesday and I am vowing to myself to get off Google and never go back on for answers. I don't know what else to do yet, but I feel this is a good start.

healthanxiety,nla04,2019/01/21,"Healthy anxiety is literally going to kill me (Sorry for the essay) Okay so you're all going to probably think I'm a nut job and you're probably right.. I've been a bit of a hypochondriac since a child but it's gotten way worse in recent years (I'm now 27). I actually don't even know what to do anymore? I went to counselling about this last year and it did zilch! The past year has been my absolute worst!!!

I'm a Googler and it's really starting to piss me off! Every single pain I get I end up googling it and lose my shit thinking it's cancer or something deadly. Heck, sometimes I don't even Google it and I just assume it's something bad! The anxiety got that bad in the summer time that I was crying every night and having no sleep thinking I was going to die and couldn't get out of bed for work. I'd literally made my self depressed. I then did actually get really ill from all the worry and stress. I just don't want to have death thoughts everytime I feel a pain or a niggle! I'm even getting scared of feeling my own breasts incase I feel a lump!!! I also hate it when I see articles on Facebook telling you the symptoms to look out for for certain cancers and then those symptoms are stuck in my brain for life and I end up tying those symptoms to my pains and thus the anxiety begins! I'm literally stressed and on edge every single day now, it's exhausting!

So my question is, is there anybody else out there suffering with this too? And how are you coping with it? I literally can't go on like this, feeling like i'm going to die all the time. It's an absolute waste of life.

healthanxiety,ashleeohmy,2019/01/21,"I need help. In a bad state. I’ve never posted on Reddit before, but here it goes: I’m 31, female, and I have been suffering (and I mean suffering) from what I am reluctant to label health anxiety. I have suffered from anxiety, panic, and depression since I was 19. I have also had severe stomach problems since I was probably about 10 years old. For the last, I would say, 4 months of 2018, I had intensifying acid reflux. I avidly practice yoga, and it got to the point that I couldn’t do down dog without bile coming back up my throat. Christmas night, I suffered a panic attack out of the blue...and somewhere around that time (I can’t recall exactly when) I must have googled that symptom (severe acid reflux) and ended up at the conclusion that I have stomach cancer or pancreatic cancer. I have rather honed in on pancreatic. In the weeks following this, I have completely lost my appetite. I’ve dropped about 10-15 pounds.   I have horrible dry mouth, pains in my abdomen and back, sporadic diarrhea (when I actually can eat anything) I cannot work, be a mother, or give my attention to anything that isn’t focused on my impending demise. I have obsessively written down my theories about what I think I have, my symptoms and what’s causing them. I feel as if I can feel the cancer in my body. I’ve even researched how to tell my child that I have cancer bc I want to be prepared. I endlessly google and search YouTube videos. I have an emergency appt with my primary care doctor of 5 years tomorrow, and I am terrified. My mother is having to drive me bc I am so incapacitated mentally. I have considered checking myself into a psychiatric hospital, but I ultimately see no point in that bc I know it’s not mental. I don’t know what I want from posting this. I’m just at the end of my rope and wanted to share my story.

healthanxiety,kliodka,2019/01/21,"How do I get over exercise anxiety? I haven’t worked out in years and try not to over exert myself too much because I have this fear that I’m somehow going to have a heart attack and die by doing so. Idk if this is normal, but when I do exert myself, I get lightheaded, nauseous, shaky, weak, pins and needles sensations, etc. and it just ignites my HA to the point where I try avoid it at all costs. 

I know exercise anxiety is a common thing among those with HA, but I can’t seem to break through it. It’s even gotten to the point where I will unconsciously make myself breathe lighter, even when not doing any physical activity, just so I can’t hear myself breathing (I guess my brain associates audible breathing with physical exertion??). And then that leads to even more anxiety/symptoms because my respiration gets all screwy from not taking full, deep breaths. 

I really don’t want to go my whole life having these anxieties when most other people don’t even give it a second thought. Is there any way I can get over this? Does anyone have any advice?",8.140049261083746,6.985218103448279,7.963453201970445,74.12508128078821,62.546798029556655,11.469753694581282,35.07832512315271,10.577609850970193,3.5273373399014787,837,30,157,17,10,269,121,203,0.131,0.818,0.051,-0.9082,0,1,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,2,17,7,1,3,5,2,18,10,6,4,2,32,35,15,1,3,8,0,0,0,0,1,4,2,0,0,14,8,0,1,3,2,1,3,8,5,0,1,2,2,21,2,19,32,8,24,0,0,0,0,2,13,0,6,6,115,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13490116989962106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2816368440567458,0.0,0.3168243389117017,0.0,0.0,0.09652798994598777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15705216268875466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16830838114494376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541098073100417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14327443144060886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1208087607963102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15396259296763876,0.3647237237982107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15534498443518766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28850236668981977,0.13243044124829947,0.15691435055640268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15207798569511838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555927379839768,0.16359028773812942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07586884269283925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09750901998429287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214965711502424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10148286565935187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13525999765822502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09570670613470317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26100433860423106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843856664866813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12567582179728548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14348713561075596,0.10379665616468456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917144949609019,0.0,0.0,0.10959652959062988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18745420379287134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08142565243622131,0.10957791418423796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15412824642622056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10050227335417904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08889987658132653

healthanxiety,throwaway177364,2019/01/21,"HA over some yogurt I just ate I opened up a new container of yogurt today (one of those big 2 lb ones) and when I did, I noticed there was some liquid, as well as tiny holes covering the entire surface - almost as if there were bubbles that gathered on top and then popped leaving behind tiny indentations. 

I’m not so worried about the liquid since that’s common, but I’m wondering what those holes were. I scraped off the top layer and the yogurt underneath seemed fine so I ate it, but now I can’t stop thinking about the possibility it might have been bad. I know I can’t do anything about it now, but my mind keeps fixating on the thought that it wasn’t safe to eat and I’m somehow going to get sick. 

Does anyone have any words of advice that might help to calm my anxiety about this?",4.281801029159522,5.227918918238999,4.964253859348201,85.21646655231565,70.50943396226415,7.794396798170384,26.404230989136646,8.00094639256281,1.4328062893081763,624,19,128,8,11,201,100,159,0.086,0.7829999999999999,0.131,0.5279,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,2,14,6,0,0,7,1,13,5,0,0,0,28,26,15,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,12,5,3,4,5,0,0,1,4,1,1,2,9,0,11,5,20,15,2,20,0,0,0,0,2,11,0,9,8,87,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1847878924989535,0.0,0.0,0.18935793422872205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285955708711974,0.0,0.14466220449491696,0.0,0.0,0.13222423380428638,0.0,0.15561450224351608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578919351348604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16548408230685827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934981435097426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987977798139945,0.0,0.10747079570820348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267508147147468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16808218855301807,0.0,0.0,0.10392529255288377,0.0,0.0,0.20023128763904166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4012138229431543,0.1909387066708259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826355012337176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21529342211256025,0.0,0.0,0.2562802729098343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2131836381459615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1721509922061815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15642679557534153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15809740292038854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12116866809120135,0.0,0.15012554556288235,0.0,0.0,0.17924620336212108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1700250463428548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20507261595643805,0.0,0.1920418514728914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ocdishere,2019/01/21,"Dealing with ALS Anxiety Hi All,

This is my first post here, but I've found the content extremely helpful as I've tried to manage my anxiety about ALS for the last week or so. 

I'm a 30 year old male, in what I would consider very good health, but since an incident 2 weeks ago I've had extreme and debilitating health anxiety about having terminal cancer or ALS. 

It started with numbness and tingling in my feet, legs, and eventually groin after watching a live basketball game in an uncomfortable chair. I was already worried due to a urinary issue that started a week before this incident (and has since resolved) so I think I was a bit more on edge than normal. 

Anyway, since this event I've had the perception of weakness in my body and the feeling comes and goes. I don't have any evidence of actual weakness, but when I think about lifting weights I dont think I can lift the same amount that I'm used to. As a result, I'm compelled to do strength tests with objects around me. It's a nightmare. 

To make matters worse my thumb on my left hand had been twitching slightly for 2 days now. I can see a visible pulsation in my hand near the base of my thumb and hand. I'm thinking my thumb may be twitching as a result of whatever artery/vein is there, but I'm really scared. 

I've gone to a few doctors over the last few weeks (urologist and nurse practitoner) and they haven't flagged anything as a cause for concern. I'm set to see my PCP on Friday. ALS fear is consuming my life... can anyone help?",6.143095144097908,5.9912729463087295,6.570631662060799,79.17620410580342,66.18120805369128,9.964784840110543,34.643505724437425,9.627879704456738,3.1144746940386887,1190,51,236,22,17,387,166,298,0.13,0.763,0.107,-0.7998,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,1,3,11,8,0,2,20,0,22,18,6,6,1,40,42,22,0,2,6,0,5,0,0,2,11,0,0,1,8,14,1,0,8,1,0,2,3,5,0,1,8,8,22,3,37,31,7,34,0,0,3,0,7,12,0,3,18,137,30,3,0.0,0.0,0.1127363871612828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10240653423593277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12748544733319342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856141576391458,0.0,0.2651304593693845,0.0,0.0,0.08077823315056502,0.0,0.09506778131489818,0.10284233735769906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09830383457541733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612410853813802,0.1283229737176751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11867668401556758,0.0,0.09951513361488648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07450449864093395,0.1191018909625557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11824541640953268,0.0,0.0,0.13539522247117847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299984945143682,0.05841324888383347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09826607415941556,0.0,0.1266679320384537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689744921548596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2455967656577772,0.0,0.0,0.15486884012815466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12057878285040816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18833767680297164,0.0,0.0,0.1255189762735202,0.0,0.08159919578747747,0.0,0.0,0.10201128134632832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0771142804418404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11319062618930174,0.0,0.0,0.12122475502598208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106416556715876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0740087011057132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566134725422195,0.0,0.1841180004277128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28669207906359795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16353932479377792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2960967332539671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07843434524797895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09977708495607272,0.0,0.09532077490239163,0.0,0.0,0.3706708897803475,0.14067914079194702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173219235734419,0.11773052529589804,0.08206611993292122,0.0,0.0,0.0743947425152132
healthanxiety,SriSaiHospital,2019/01/21,"Home Remedies for Dehydration Dehydration occurs when your body has lost more fluid than you have taken in. Remaining hydrated is critical to your overall health. Every cell in your body needs water, along with oxygen, to function properly.

Anyone can become dehydrated, but those at a higher risk include infants, young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, endurance athletes and people living at high altitudes.

Some common causes of dehydration are vigorous exercise in hot weather, diarrhea, vomiting, excessive sweating and increased urination.

healthanxiety,astrorocks,2019/01/21,"Anxiety about heart Last week I went to the emergency room for heart palpitations. They did a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work. In the end, I was told that I had a spot on my lung and a slight irregularity in the EKG. Blood work was all fine. It was suggested I follow up with a cardiologist for an echocardiogram and 24-hour holter monitor and a radiologist for the CT. I had the CT scan done last Friday and it was a calcification in the lung (probably from a childhood of asthma, bronchitis, and pleurisy). No big deal. However, the palpitations had worsened to the point I couldn't sleep on Thursday (they're at their worst when I try to sleep). I spoke to the cardiologist and he suggested magnesium which has helped calm it down I think. However, I've now developed a cough which has been worsening over the last few days. I went in to the cardiologist this morning to get the 24 hour EKG put on and drop off the CT scan results and, just an hour after, the nurse called and asked if I would be okay to move my appointment from next Monday to this Friday at 9 am. I am completely freaked out that there is something really wrong--especially since the appointment was moved up. If the doctor had noticed anything really wrong, would he have gotten me in more immediately? I think all the anxiety about the condition is making all the symptoms worse and I'm not really sure how to stop it completely. Any advice is appreciated.

healthanxiety,TexasRed21,2019/01/22,"Worried about colon cancer... again. Hey all long story short I’ve been worried I have colon cancer for like 5 years now with months of not worrying alternating with weeks of major anxiety. I’m 24/ M / 190 Pounds and have struggled with blood on the toilet paper every few months. About a year ago I went to urgent care to try and remedy my worry, had a digital rectal exam that the doctor said was “totally normal” which relieved me for all of about a month. For the last few months I’ve felt like I finally beat my worry and today I went and had like 2 little drops of blood on the wipe I used even after a relatively soft and easy to pass stool. So now I’m here, trying to decided if I should pay up and have a colonoscopy or if I’m just letting my anxiety get to me again. Anybody else have this fear or any advice for someone who does?

I was also reading about experiencing pain after alcohol! Sometimes when I take a shot, my upper back and head hurt, I feel like I have a heavy weight on me. Read this can be lymphoma symptoms, now very worried!

healthanxiety,Cookie-Jedi,2019/01/22,"At the end of my rope, no idea what to do and constantly want to kill myself for feeling this way. IMPORTANT: I am not currently in danger of hurting myself and i have the suicide prevention number in my phone. I AM however always contemplating killing myself to free myself from this constant health related anxiety. 

I am a 26 year old american guy, no health insurance. 

For the past 8 years now Ive been battling some absolutely crippling health anxiety. After almost dying doing some drugs in college I really shouldnt have (K2/spice), I have been in constant fear that I am dying for one reason or another ever since.

 Ive convinced myself I had heart failure and had multiple echos, EKGs, ultrasounds, etc of my heart done, all clear. The stress from all of that caused me to develop migraines really badly within the first year. Those migraines caused me to convince myself I had an aneurysm or meningitis, so I had CT Scans, MRIs, angeograms, a spinal tap, all came back clear and I was told it is just migraines. This has been going on for years and this past summer I spent a month in an inpatient facility for actually trying to kill myself over it.

Now, after recently reading about a brain eating amoeba killing a woman in seattle for using a neti pot, ive been sleepless and at a 12/10 on the anxiety scale convinced Ive got only a week left to live. 

I'm at the end of my rope, I dont know how to stop feeling this way all the time. I have constant panic attacks, I spend a lot of my days crying and I am just so paralyzing AFRAID that I'm dying I can hardly function.

Please, what should I do?

healthanxiety,gingercap,2019/01/22,"Hit my head about 2 months ago, have vertigo and memory issues Hi guys. I hit the side of my head very hard on the corner of a table in late November. I didn’t lose consciousness and there was no blood. I also didn’t have vomiting or nausea. That said, lately I’ve been having vertigo (feeling like the floor is moving out from under me) and i feel extremely out of it, like I’m living in a movie, along with shortness of breath. Everything is made WAY WORSE by caffeine. Also sometimes i will have a headache or dull pain in the area that i hit my head but it’s about once a week so not often. I have been to two doctors who have examined me and said I’m fine but I’ve had no CT scan or MRI. I am so scared i have a hematoma or something!! But it’s also been two months and in that time i have had a LOT of alcohol, been on a vacation, and been on rollercoasters and I’ve been ok minus the vertigo and brain fog. How worried should i be?? Please help me!

healthanxiety,livinonacoffee,2019/01/22,"Can someone talk me through this?! Coping mechanisms Hi everyone. 

I would like to start by saying I am already on medicine and I have 3 big changes in my life; every time a change comes up, I fall back down this rabbit hole of “having a brain tumor.” 

I can’t stop obsessing over it and being a military wife, I can’t let this happen each PCS/ move. I make myself feel the symptoms: tingly feet, headaches, dizziness, foggy vision, etc. and I can’t stop focusing on every little pain, or ailment. I don’t know what to do. My medicine works great except for these times of change. I run, I watch what I eat. How else can I deal with this? 

Please, any and all suggestions welcome!!!!

healthanxiety,solidmedusa,2019/01/22,"death anxiety plus health anxiety after my fathers death hi folks, my dad passed away on december 2018 after a horrible accident who drove him in a coma state, after a month in the intensive care unit he lost a lot of weight, he looked  soo skiny and fragile, i was witness of his extreme agony, then he woked up from the coma state just to realize that he had irreversible neurological damage, everytime when i went to visit him to his room, he started to cry, feeling unable to speak due the damage.

when everything looks stable to my dad (aparently) the doctors tooks the desicion to send him to our house, and then start to the recovery terapy regime, in the second day, he died, the cause of his dead maybe was due cardiac issues, since then i cant sleep properly, my mind are broken, i can see my dad in my nigthmares, suffering as the days when he was at the hospital, now i have an existencial crisis, i realize that life is so short, also im suffering from health anxiety, i fear to heart diseases, always checking my heart rate, my blood pressure, and when i sleep, in my dreams, i can see my body in a coffin, feeling that im dying or already dead

what can i do guys? i know this is part of the grief, but what can i do for the health anxiety?, i used to smoked weed, since that incident and due the health anxiety everytime when i smoked i experienced full blown panic attacks, i die in my nigthmares, i see my dad suffering in those dreams....

note: my dad was young, and his dead was unexpected.

im depressed now, yess, but anxiety is worse than my depression",8.538826868495747,6.775337754966888,8.530141911069066,72.32675496688742,62.17880794701986,12.337180700094605,37.13434247871334,11.20814326018867,3.9997561021759696,1230,47,235,28,14,402,159,302,0.264,0.7120000000000001,0.024,-0.9973,1,0,2,0,0,0,45.0,1,0,0,1,10,14,1,3,19,0,18,16,6,2,0,19,35,20,10,0,4,6,4,0,0,0,9,1,1,1,9,6,1,0,5,2,1,6,1,13,0,1,11,11,39,1,36,24,3,45,0,9,5,0,27,15,0,2,22,146,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10203385512433437,0.07394163878911475,0.07693559411003091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42439797555309494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10518860408625164,0.08687087037371735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102704175129987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09427093004445357,0.09498370078141458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015649054299852,0.11926037645021295,0.0,0.15927436266960354,0.0,0.2878821377523403,0.0,0.0,0.09463853278495317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08309867097910076,0.0,0.0,0.10404518973050664,0.09350289148497833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09155168258825266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.393130123168279,0.0,0.2191352696408836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668846081488023,0.0,0.0,0.29962371298557045,0.09650605867406917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05081456708313512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06530847791184602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15528918833932862,0.0,0.1009329371253724,0.07860768478261104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0928902690455681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09336002315273263,0.0,0.07380209741284494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10848395735541523,0.0,0.10012707943407542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22104016310572253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529706523235087,0.0,0.18505707636861105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308898240716697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10272842125195457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798572766076461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259351848266995,0.0,0.0857129810107989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09422643613868976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,bigheadsmolbrain,2019/01/22,"No relief... It's pretty frustrating but knowing my anxiety is causing me a lot of these worrying physical sensations, it doesn't make them go away. I'm well aware that I'm struggling with health anxiety and when things flare up I tell myself over and over that it's a mental problem but I still don't get much relief.

I take painkillers almost every day for various aches and pains, I try sipping water when my throat feels tight. I know I don't get enough exercise (it can exacerbate feeling shaky and lightheaded) and I probably don't eat right either. I get low moods and feel unmotivated a lot of the time.

Any tips on how to self help? What small things work for other people?

healthanxiety,ellll1999,2019/01/22,"I'm so done with these thoughts I can't deal with this anymore. Every ache, pain, itch or sensation is something that I'm hyperaware of. I can't go a day without thinking there's something wrong with me. Every night I lie in bed wondering if I'll wake up in the morning, and every morning I dread getting up out of bed. 

I'm not too bad when I'm with people, it's when I'm alone with my thoughts is when they really start to manifest. I'm 19 and currently in university and this is having an impact on my work and social life. This all began after I lost my grandmother to cancer last November. Seeing the struggle messed me up, and it didn't help that she died in my house and I spoke to her the night before she passed. 

I'm just so damn sick of this. What the hell do I do? I feel so suffocated by myself. I'm at breaking point.

healthanxiety,Healthanxiety13,2019/01/22,"Sharp/Intense Pain in lower left abdomen? Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, i want to say, a couple of days ago i saw a picture of warning for testicular cancer so i insta checked my testicles and i felt a bump on top of it. I started reading other symptoms of this and i think i saw lower abdomen pain but i dont think its related to this! 

&amp;#x200B;

For about 3 days ive had this random sharp pain in my lower left abdomen. It can stay for hours and then its gone but then it comes back. It's been going on for about 3 days and im getting worried. I'm a known sufferer and i have very intense health anxiety. I've stopped taking my pills and im on my 3rd week i believe without them. Can this be something thats causing this? I'm super paranoid about it and its all i think about and it feels like im the only one with this symptom in the so called health anxiety people. Has anyone else had a similar pain in there left lower abdomen or am i really alone?",0.7420166047629451,3.0579910452261347,2.8456543587502736,90.0711339305222,85.78391959798995,5.269914791348045,23.727550797465593,6.7026698264267655,0.8714927244920251,754,30,154,9,23,254,107,199,0.227,0.71,0.063,-0.9848,4,1,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,3,8,7,0,0,7,0,11,14,4,1,2,26,27,15,0,1,4,0,3,1,0,0,10,1,0,0,17,10,0,1,6,1,1,3,2,5,0,2,7,6,18,2,24,19,2,27,0,1,2,0,4,11,0,2,13,97,35,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08834986922065281,0.0,0.0,0.10322622436563182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21598096370268946,0.2422156090354504,0.0,0.0,0.15249184104945224,0.0,0.0,0.06969034142182359,0.10212187637055534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766387140824825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11229196085855796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10177240290722754,0.0,0.0,0.10238672356746056,0.0,0.08585535196508964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11028099698351143,0.0,0.1928332823795674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11681041925381835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832600141545865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05039525005064853,0.07120300097869756,0.09569712757558388,0.0,0.0,0.08477774260780556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052072534730257775,0.0,0.05664375001685173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21188532830228626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09815312653944394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322976363558498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3248694593919159,0.0,0.0,0.048692861067183776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06753776976012052,0.07580217753137658,0.42421608082629264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909739890593088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969519821100144,0.0,0.06385001809372662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07926017416086946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07672947016519767,0.0,0.0,0.0705456837582066,0.10623306824773852,0.0,0.08332710026313131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2071868993842801,0.07493810251936328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19159012548491774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223672502415956,0.058786902347704714,0.0,0.07994783946243961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09607661374780802,0.0,0.0,0.10121792209614663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422156090354504,0.0
healthanxiety,MalteseFalcon15,2019/01/22,"Shortness of Breath Hi,

I'm a 28 year old relatively healthy male who experienced my first ever panic attack on January 3rd (after waking up sometime in the beginning of December having a mini-attack and shortness of breath followed for weeks). I was sitting at home watching Friends and my left arm started tingling and immediately my heart started pounding and I started sweating - I eventually calmed down and went to the emergency room (i've never done that before) to get checked out - the doctor checked my blood pressure, oxygen, etc and said everything looked fine. 

I felt really weird after that. I had an appointment with my family doctor to get blood work, an ECG, and a lung/chest x-ray done and yesterday I was told that everything looked fine on the scans.

Today I got shortness of breath again. Has anybody experienced something like this before? Is it normal for shortness of breath to linger for a few months when you're feeling stressed?

I don't want to become a hypochondriac and I trust my doctor but it just feels off to me.

It looks nothing like any picture I've looked up. Just a bright red bubble and it's been growing the past 3 weeks or so, it was very tiny before and he had picked at it thinking it was a scab, it bled and bled, but that was when it was the size of a large freckle maybe, now it's the size if a mole.

healthanxiety,JimmyWitchy,2019/01/22,"Problems with stomach and I feel like I'm about to fall apart... Recently, I began having problems with my stomach and I'm paranoid/panicking that they are something worse.  


I'm 20, Asian, overweight (195 at 5'11), and I'm worried that the symptoms I have are something really bad- abdominal pain, gas issues, constipation, diarrhea, and yellow, runny stool that I don't know where it came from.  


Has anyone have symptoms like this? Do they know where they came from and why? Is it a sign of something bad? Because I'm on the verge of panicking right now and need to know.",3.2420475785896343,5.885858336448603,3.863449447748515,84.68892098555652,77.78504672897195,6.507731520815634,27.48428207306712,7.686295010490155,1.84495140186916,450,19,81,7,11,142,66,107,0.238,0.7190000000000001,0.043,-0.9712,0,0,3,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,3,0,4,7,0,0,3,0,9,6,2,0,0,18,22,6,0,3,0,0,1,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,6,10,1,0,4,0,0,3,1,5,0,0,3,2,8,2,11,19,0,13,0,0,1,0,3,7,0,0,5,46,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1192018856250964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28468331184930845,0.10392154861098207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3899618646394605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861985851988433,0.12178921505711628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17793429890149995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.281070053802239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16657346591421734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264069632166932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1814001614689578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3262480353392351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1092123011408484,0.0,0.16832604069903154,0.0,0.0,0.14558691926675507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3937259026187795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35438295436000555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15382949713304953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1731282546010961,0.17373121524886925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,neuranxiety,2019/01/23,"Anyone else here with HA who works in a biomedical/disease-related field? Hi everyone! This community is a great support on days I'm feeling bad, and I've had this question on my mind for awhile. 

I've struggled with anxiety my entire life, officially diagnosed w/ GAD when I turned 13, and have been on meds/in therapy since. One component of my anxiety is bouts of severe hypochondria that wax and wane as far as I can remember (my earliest memory of this is crying to my mom because I was terrified of having cancer and dying - I was 7). 

While I was terrified of diseases, I was also fascinated by them. I remember watching Mystery Diagnosis episodes when I was in middle school (which, while super cool to me when watching, would result in me later being terrified by whatever disease the episode featured). When I began seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, I got very interested in mental illness, and later that led me to an interest in neurological disease in high school, which, eventually, as it turned out, morphed into my career. 

(Very) long-story-short, I ended up getting my undergraduate degree in neuroscience, and am now a 1st-year PhD student in molecular biology, where I study protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases. For someone who spent much of their life with bad HA, it's very ironic that so much of my time is now spent attending lectures on disease and taking courses in pathology. I still struggle with my anxiety, but regularly see a therapist &amp; psychiatrist to keep things in check. 

My experience has led me to wonder if anyone else in this community has a biomedical/research/disease-related job? If so, I'd love to hear your stories.

healthanxiety,FightingAnxiety22,2019/01/23,"I just stopped an upcoming panic attack and i feel great about it Just now, i Stopped a panic attack. I have never stopped a panic attack before and this is my first one in a while. Worrying to much about my abdomen caused me to have a panic attack but i felt it coming. My breathing started to feel heavy, i started sweating and having chills, you know what its like. What did i do to stop it? I thought of something i saw on a youtube video that i never belived would work. Firstly, I opened my window (cold does help with panic attacks atleast for me). Then I started tapping in my face and started to rate my panic attack from 1-10 and see how bad it was after every 30 seconds. It's still about 4/10 but it went down quick and it did not explode to a fully attack.

healthanxiety,boolean98,2019/01/23,"CT Scan Worries 20 Y/O trans guy getting a abdominal and pelvoc CT scan for chronic pelvic pain, blood in urine, and possible stones that never passed. I have been suffering for months and I have been delaying this procedure for weeks. My doctor fianlly listened and referred me to a urologist. I have already done an X-RAY and gotten referrals to urogynecology with no conclusive answers except using Tylenol for pain. 

Before this happened to me MDs have offered SSRIs and asked me if this was an exacerbation of my anxiety. 

Wish me luck y'all! I've been googlong ways to reduce radiation and calling all the CT scan centers near me... 

Apparently I can use lead shields for my legs, chest, arms, and thyroid which means a lot to me. 

I am trying not to worry about the long term issues about radiation but it can be exhausting. 

Y'all are strong and thoughful people and I wish the best in your health journeys.

healthanxiety,weedquestion123,2019/01/23,"16 and worried about my weight I'm a 16 year old male and I've always been really underweight and I have a terrible diet, rarely eat fruit or veg. When I was 12 I was 4.5 stone, and now that I'm 16 I average at around 7 stone. Since I've always been underweight, I've never really worried about it but recently I've started to worry, it makes sense because of my terrible diet, and that I never exercise, but with all this anxiety about my health I've started to worry, is this something I should be worried about? Or is it as simple as eating healthier and getting more exercise, thanks.

healthanxiety,carusing,2019/01/23,"Has anyone’s anxiety gave them upper back pains? 23F. I am currently dealing with upper back pains (specifically in between and around my shoulder blades) and I have no idea the cause. I don’t work out, nor I barely lift anything more than 5lbs. I work in retail, the most my body ever hurts is when I finally sit down and my feet. I sleep in the same left side position I have been for the last 2 years or so and this also helped out with my gastric issues. I’m not sure if it’s my posture, but I can’t disagree that it could be. But, I get no relief when I straighten my back. This pain/ache does have the tendency to migrate between left and right, spreads out in a line, and seems to never go past 1/2 inch of my shoulder blades. 

The most that has changed in the last two months was my health anxiety, brought on because I thought I had esophageal cancer (spoiler: I don’t) and was actually suffering from an abnormal narrowing of my esophagus and was later discovered that I also had a mild case of gastritis and duodenitis that was **definitely** caused by my anxiety. Back to normal, lab work said that I had no infection or pre-cancerous tissue with a follow up of a barium swallow tomorrow. I got over and past my anxiety towards esophageal (and stomach) cancer. 

But, my upper back pain is starting to trigger me badly because I can’t stop switching between “you have lung cancer”... “nope, it’s pancreatic cancer”....“lung cancer”....”pancreatic cancer” and so on and so forth. I started checking for jaundice, my breathing, my lymph nodes, WebMD’ing/Mayo Clinic’ing, the whole sha-bang. The upper back pain came on roughly last week during a horrible nausea and vomiting episode for not taking my PPI. Most of my body went to normal, but my back didn’t. It doesn’t really help that during my episode... my entire back spazzed and stiffened up when I was laying down on my back. Didn’t stop until I managed to turn to my side. Yesterday, I panicked so badly that I made an appointment with a counselor, a psychiatrist, and a physician. 

**TL;DR:** I have migrating upper back pains for ~2 weeks, no known cause from what I know. Bad HA in the last 2 months. I’m becoming fearful that it’s between pancreatic and/or lung cancer.

_I’m just trying to live my best life..._

healthanxiety,IramDei,2019/01/23,"DVT Anxiety Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

So starting Monday morning my right leg (thigh just above the ankle) started to hurt in a weird mix of a cramp and DOMS like way. The pain didn't go away for three days now and yesterday when examining it with my gf my leg has also swollen and became tender at the area where the pain comes from.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I went to my GP who measured my legs, and examined them with her hands. She said she doesn't think it is a vein issue just a pulled or twisted muscle, so I should just rest and take over the counter muscle relaxing meds. I told her that I did not do anything particularly active over the weekend (just sleeping and playing video games pretty much), she still said that I could have just strained a muscle while sleeping and it might keep on hurting for 1-2 weeks even. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still very worried and anxious as DVT is often misdiagnosed and people even die after being sent home thinking that it is just a muscle strain. My leg still hurts with no improvement whatsoever (maybe even getting a bit worse, although that might just be my brain), it is swollen in one area, but I am not feeling extra warmth and there is no discoloration.

healthanxiety,Red-handed-anxiety,2019/01/23,"Canker Sore: Is this cancer concerns. So every now and then when I drink, I chew tobacco. Over 2 years, I have done it 6 times and probably a total of one can of dip across all of that. 

Anyway, I chewed 10 days ago or so. And a few days after, I had was eating chicken and cut my lip on a bone. It's been 8 days, and the cut turned into a canker sore. It seems to be healing, and the pain from it is less every day. But my mind is convinced it is cancer from my very light tobacco use. Rationally, I know it isn't but still anxiety is there. 

Ugh....

Ever since I thought there was something physically wrong which doctors could not find anything, even nothing stood out to the neurologist. I even had MRI of my head, neck and back. Nothing. Blood test nothing.

healthanxiety,jhbern95,2019/01/24,"GERD Fears - Please Help Hello, been a while since I posted here. Anyways, I've had on and off acid reflux since I was 19 or 20 (23 now). It started when I went to an ENT because my singing voice wasn't quite right (I sang a cappella in college) and he said ""oh you probably have GERD"". Never did a diagnostic test or anything. 

Then came Summer 2017. I heard that acid reflux can lead to Barrett's and then esophageal c. Coincidentally, I also started to feel a lump in my throat, which I knew HAD to be esophageal c. So, I got an endoscopy. It came back clean with a little irritation. BUT, it was clean! Great. Needless to say, the lump disappeared. 

I've been on and off meds for GERD ever since. For the past 6-9 months, I've been off them because, truthfully, my reflux hasn't been bad. Tums or Zantac usually suffices if I need it. PPIs aren't good long term anyways. 

About five days ago, the lump in my throat returned. Coincidentally, I've been drinking more coffee lately and being very liberal with my diet. I'm hoping the lump is one of two things. 1. Irritation from increased reflux due to liberal diet. 2. Cricopharyngeal spasm (essentially the upper sphincter in throat being too tight due to anxiety, stress, etc.). I am literally praying to God every night that it isn't anything worse, but I'm still terrified. Could my clean scope have progressed to Barrett's or worse in a year and a half? 

Background - I suffer from chronic OCD, anxiety, and depression. I just started my first real job since graduating college and recently moved into a new apartment. I've suffered from a sphincter spasm before... it was down south... not fun. When I take my klonopin (IT IS PRESCRIBED) it seems to get better. Additionally, my throat feels better when eating, drinking, or in the morning. PLEASE HELP ME.

healthanxiety,kronos4all,2019/01/24,"Back here again Damn colon cancer.

I'm afraid again and it seems more palpable than ever. This started two years ago after getting some blood work done. I got in my head that I could have colon cancer.

All my symptoms began after all results were good. I started having some light blood on my stool (a line here and there). Then my right lymph node grew, then shrunk, then grew and so on (it's still swollen but smaller). Then I started having diarrhea and watery dolls with a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Then I started noticing my skin is getting pale, more visible veins.(I sometimes see myself going from normal to pale to normal a couple of times in a day). I do the palmar crease pallor test almost constantly now.

I noticed that my fingernails were either pale or blue - ish sometimes (started thinking of iron deficiency and that scares the cap out of me).

Then I started feeling weaker, tired, after very little effort (should note that I put on 10 kg in this time). Arms started feeling weaker, got some armpit pain, chest pain, etc.

Then my back started hurting. My lower left back. Sometimes my lower right too. Then it started hurting more and more often. Now it hurts along my left leg as well as left hip. I read a post a while ago that said the op was diagnosed after very similar symptoms, so naturally I started freaking out again.

Now I'm seeing some similar stuff with my dad and it really drives me back to freaking out.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm at the end of my rope.

healthanxiety,zesane,2019/01/24,"I'm Going Crazy (Brain Tumor fear) Hey guys.
(Sorry if my grammar may seem a bit choppy. English is not my first language). 
I'm running into alot of anxiety. I feel like I'm losing my mind at this point. 

I have been experiencing neurological symptoms that seem to come and go by months. It all started on Thanksgiving. The very first symptom was a strange headach. It was dull yet slightly painfull. What followed afterward was strange weakness feeling in my sholdure and jaw. These symptoms suddenly went away the after. A week I had expreinces no symptoms. In the beginning of December, I began to experience these same symptoms again. 

All day I could not keep my mind off of these symptoms. I eventually succumbed into a full blown panic attack. Those specific moment felt like I was about to die. 
The symptoms continued throughout the month of December. During this time I was able to go to my family doctor. He seemed to shrug it off.
They took my blood, which turned out to be normal. 
My anxiety not stopping either. These symptoms would occasionally relive than come back. There are period where these symptoms would become stronger and new ones will form. I began to expreince strange dizziness. My balance also felt slightly off. I could not keep my mind off of it. 

After Christmas, my symptoms seemed to have completely vanished. The symptoms seem to have been gone for a good month or so.  Somehow everything felt better and I thought that was the end of that.  

Boy was I wrong. 

The symptoms all returned. And back came my anxieties of impending doom. 
I did notice that these symptoms returned when my period was beginning to start. It did get worse when I was on my period.... I don't know if that matters. 

I'm still very worried that I have a brain tumor. I feel like that my family and friends think im going crazy, but they just dont understand. I'm scared and have no where to go...

healthanxiety,mscard03,2019/01/24,"Health Anxiety causing physically visible symptoms? I recently had my first anxiety attack back in October after a google search on some symptoms that lead me to some pretty bad stuff.  It was by far the worst anxiety i have ever felt over the past 3 months.  I have been constantly lightheaded since the first panic attack and have had a lot of common symptoms that people on talk about.  Shortness of break, tight legs, back pain, bowl issues, and vision issues.  My main issues have been tingling in my middle finger, tightness in my forearm, and a sharp pain in my elbow and shoulder all in my right arm.  I have been to many doctors including neurologist, orthopedic, thoracic, pain management, ent, PT, ER 3 times and have had almost every part of my body scanned by CT and MRI.  I counted over 20 blood test and so far every single thing has come back normal.  

One doctor thinks I have thoracic outlet, but another doctor says I don't and that they are just trying to slap a generic label on my problem.  This doctor also believes it is my body stuck in ""fight or flight mode.""  The one issue that seems odd is that after using my right hand, such as in typing, my fingers will visibly slightly swell and my hand feel tight.   I know stress can cause muscle tightness and my PT keeps commenting out tight the muscles are on the right side of my body from jaw to shoulder.  Has anyone had anxiety/stress cause physically visible symptoms such as swelling?

healthanxiety,summerwind123,2019/01/24,"I need advice on what to do with my Enlarged Spleen &amp;#x200B;

In early december I found out that I have an enlarged spleen after MANY trips to the ER and being sent home because I was having ""a panic attack"" (which I have never had before) Finally, after probably over 10 visits I got a Doctor who believed me and got me appointments within days... At the time I thought it was my heart, I had a stress test done, and a echocardiogram, they said my heart was in really good condition.

We also discovered I had a high D-dimer and was sent for a CT scan for a pulmonary embolism, which was clear too. My D-dimer has come down since to around 511, much better but not super.

I then got a ultrasound of my gut because they thought maybe it was my galbladder, which was fine, they did however find out that my spleen was enlarged, it was something like 13.5 cm, so not super enlarged, it is still enlarged and it effects my day-to-day life. For example I cannot lie down on that side or cannot eat too much or it gets aggravated.

I have been tested for Mono, it was clear, I have just recently (2 days ago) gotten my mirena removed (I need to illiminate all possibilities no matter how small) and he has put me on a high dose of 2 different antibiotics. There is nothing left that I can think of that could enlarge my spleen besides cancer or some sort of virus that has not been found.

Other symtoms I am having, currently I have a cough, but I am getting a cold now. However I have had a dry couch since november. I can feel my nodes in my neck and they are really uncomfortable if touched or I turn my head in a funny way. Inside my left ear hurts occassionally, as well as my left side of my jaw, sort of where the ear pain meets my jaw. The nodes in my armpits occassionally hurt too. And sometimes my hands have a sort of aching pain as if I used them for something hard and the muscles were healing.

healthanxiety,etttog,2019/01/24,"New Here Unfortunately Hi all. I am new to this forum and thought I might gain some reassurance from others who are having the same issues as myself. 

The last year or so has been filled with a few periods of time in which my health anxiety peaked. This often left me confused and helpless. Everything I feel or see makes me question if I am becoming seriously ill in some way. 

About 3 years ago I had my first issue with HA. I was having chest pains while playing baseball at school. I actually ended up going to the hospital for this and had an ECG. I was told that my heart was fine and it may just be growing pains as I was about 14 at the time. 

The next problem was where it really started to get much worse. About a year ago while showering I noticed a light brown spot (which was probably just a stain or dirt of some sort) on my foot sole. I could not stop thinking about this and was constantly measuring and photographing the spot to make sure it didn’t grow. I couldn’t help but to think this was melanoma. The dot eventually disappeared on its own after about 2-3 weeks. 

Next came issues of tingling in feet and hands. Being like I am, I did the worst thing you could probably do which was google it. Of course it is a symptom of diabetes. I now constantly feel what I believe to be different symptoms happening each day. Each symptom I hear of miraculously occurs the next day. In fact, I feel as if my vision is becoming blurred (another symptom of diabetes) as I type this. 

I know these symptoms appearing just after I learn of them is just my mind messing with me. Does anyone have any advice on how they were able to cope with these underlying thoughts?

healthanxiety,fuzzy_wuzzy_was,2019/01/24,"Stomach problems for 1 month Hi guys, me again :)

So I’ve been having stomach issues for the past month which I am pretty sure are due to anxiety / stress, but still have got me worried!

It began a month ago, when I took some magnesium on an empty stomach ( I’ve been taking it to help with palpitations) and I got crazy stomach cramps. Since then, I’ve had gas and bloating and uncomfortable bowel movements. I went to a doctor overseas (I’ve been traveling) who didn’t do any tests but just told me to take probiotics which I have been doing. 

Now that is been a couple weeks and things haven’t gone away I’m beginning to get worried. However, I can’t go to the doctor yet because my medical insurance doesn’t kick in until February 1st. 

A couple more details on my current symptoms: I have gas and bloating in the morning and before I go to bed. No problems really during the day. The pain does seem to be more localized on my right hand side. I do also get heartburn. 

Why I think it might be anxiety is because 1) I’ve travelled to 4 different time zones in the period of a 6 weeks which usually messes with my digestion. 2) I’ve been pretty anxious and stressed out because of traveling, flying, and looking for work. 3) my diet has been really out of whack as I’ve been in so many countries recently so I eat whatever is there.

I’m finally back home for good now, so stress is going down but the symptoms have not unfortunately:( what do you guys think? I don’t want to go to the doctor until I get insurance because it will be very expensive but waiting a week or more to see what is going on is killing me!

Most nights, I get this pain on my left rib cage, near my upper abdomen and the pain is ONLY when I am lying down or sitting in an awkward position. I’ve had this pain for about a month now, it seems to come and go and it’s not so terrible that I can’t sleep. But, I am awfully scared I have pancreatic cancer due to the location of the pain, but I’m only 18. The pain seems to be at the very front of my rib cage and I don’t have any back pain, where the pancreas is located in the back. It might be just a simple muscle strain but I NEED reassurance. I’m so scared. PLEASE help! Thank you",1.0336170990135152,3.2066863478260887,2.9084983558640864,91.07825356229448,83.03726708074534,6.769601753744976,20.02959444647424,7.928766900206844,0.7782960175374498,606,17,135,12,17,202,95,161,0.262,0.637,0.101,-0.9736,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,2,0,2,10,14,0,4,11,1,13,14,4,0,0,19,24,12,0,2,6,0,0,0,0,1,10,0,0,1,7,7,0,0,2,0,0,3,3,12,0,2,1,1,14,2,15,20,1,24,0,0,1,0,7,9,0,5,11,81,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07574140647612902,0.0,0.17040896133750924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712868514821449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594297801737872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18947750860519552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05819082841761309,0.0,0.06329914138490163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11839046099174708,0.0,0.0,0.2239645948950892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12101339709775327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11815531064369444,0.0,0.0,0.08890149922319204,0.0,0.0,0.16517194468385335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104521463118481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11687331950564844,0.0,0.0,0.2541257994790881,0.7110894053620294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12226048103347747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2230192272065088,0.0,0.0,0.2027901612415137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145924104974617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025426390697153,0.0,0.0,0.07399512871817565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189917833453637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11311058253635813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07172429847069943
healthanxiety,auroraTerra,2019/01/24,"Fear of MS, or is it just my anxiety? I know the likelihood of MS is so low but I don’t know. I have very stiff and tense muscles in my arms, upper back and shoulders and legs where I get frequent muscle spasms if they got overused Andy right leg has a dull burning/stinging sensation in one area of I don’t move it. I can feel the sensation of little shocks and tingles around those areas including the top of my head at certain points. Anxiety and stress seem to worsen the symptoms greatly as I don’t really get the tingles when I’m completely relaxed. I don’t see a neurologist until a week and a half and I really just want it to be a combination of stress/anxiety and the right muscles but that slim possiblity that it is frightens me. I don’t want to live with this pain and sensations forever ",3.9428053830227725,5.29421201242236,5.3269720496894415,80.76739389233957,71.73291925465837,9.093374741200828,30.186853002070393,9.516144504307137,2.7667138716356114,638,27,127,15,12,214,96,161,0.203,0.7190000000000001,0.079,-0.9685,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,1,1,7,9,0,2,11,0,12,10,5,0,1,25,23,17,0,3,6,0,1,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,11,0,1,4,1,0,1,5,6,0,2,1,2,15,3,16,21,0,20,0,2,1,0,1,14,0,3,5,83,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3813478094609893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14792227254646134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277707954039934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17422106900490614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1869820662408783,0.08401812661710995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17362893573674615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13289750382602225,0.1831977387841212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17053345170562906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182640115760286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16654120099087266,0.14672693124079084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17660732920829564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125978516911834,0.0,0.17681150681887992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1570798397756266,0.18732631582135925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21289938632359065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2838083754746669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324121647743682,0.1512705731801792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3806833902067087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17270928439069086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371037065737781,0.19601710081458645,0.0,0.13328771445659668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ThrowAwayBcReasons08,2019/01/24,"Psyching myself out over hereditary cancer So this last Summer my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer that has since gotten way worse. When she was diagnosed and they were testing her they found out that she a gene that can cause it and that gene can be passed down to my brother and I. I don’t even know the exact details of it, but I’ve read stuff about how with hereditary colon cancer you have anywhere from a 50-80% chance of developing it anytime before you’re 50. That obviously scares the absolute shit out of me. 

They said even with a healthy diet and exercise you still have a chance of getting it before 50. You can only do so much to control it basically. I went to see one doctor for something unrelated and she told me I needed to get screened at age 32 (I’m 22) but I’m scared I’ll get it before then and it’ll be too late. 

My mother didn’t realize she had it for over a year and when she finally had symptoms she was already stage 4. 

Idk I’m freaking myself the hell out because I’ve battled intense health anxiety all my life and what’s happening to my mother and what I’ve learned from it is triggering the fuck out of me. It doesn’t help that I’m extremely picky and find it harder than most to eat healthy and the only exercise I get is walking and light lifting at work.

healthanxiety,jeffthrowaway17,2019/01/24,"Tingling left chin and other parts - should I be concerned? Hi guys,

So straight into it - I was stressing (panic attack probably) about my brother’s health (He got Leukaemia a few years ago) because I had thought it had came back. Also been pretty depressed thinking about in the past 2 months (never knew how bad it was). 

Now when I was worried about this, I felt a tingling sensation on my left chin. This was around two weeks.  Maybe 4 times or so this has happened, however recently it feels like it has been more recurring (not sure if focusing on it has to do with it). I was super stressed thinking I’ve got cancer so I got my CBC, which there was no issue with.

Now I went to the dentist today and told him about the tingling. He said to me to get an x-ray and he really wasn’t sure why it was like that. My wisdom teeth had came through and he was pretty stern on me getting it checked. That scared me a decent amount, he said that x-ray will show what the problem is.


Since this ordeal and getting the all clear after the CBC, I will get random tingling throughout my body for a few seconds in small sports it goes away. (As soon as I move my limb or finger, they go away) I’ve also been a bitch more itchy of late and get the occasional sharp pains.


However apart from this I’ve been fine (no other symptoms) Eating a lot, lots of energy, no headaches, not feeling tired, no blood in stool and no night sweats. I’m just concerned what this could be. Should I be concerned? 

Thanks guys love you all!",3.027692307692309,4.792450926421406,3.439617391304345,91.70429565217394,74.85284280936455,6.121792642140468,24.66903010033445,6.742157984588678,0.7407989565217385,1173,38,245,10,25,364,168,299,0.142,0.73,0.128,-0.5843,2,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,0,1,1,1,18,19,2,4,14,0,29,17,5,1,6,40,55,19,0,5,6,1,5,2,0,4,10,2,0,2,24,13,1,0,7,2,1,5,9,10,0,2,28,7,23,9,28,19,10,38,0,1,0,1,16,15,1,6,20,160,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09075747132244563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16375331569460655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911437004788275,0.0,0.1164768794314761,0.19238677007882005,0.07872717817112601,0.08548658271560193,0.062412496212413626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137258349194905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2342006419756535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08174550263926862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881834153915603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10476466094568043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10353711899304192,0.07314333769138841,0.09830494813625827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2674577573887157,0.0,0.05818733590777594,0.0,0.2456581434543253,0.0,0.0,0.20275303370005332,0.0905380653283198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10882968348835112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686256993551732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154939078088642,0.0,0.2224816018735952,0.0,0.0,0.10003955819958843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740868776108869,0.09240579438618786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10285875320777403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08172214164090744,0.10881826812571943,0.0,0.0,0.07896505514189897,0.0,0.0,0.0960806947927722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894407408220738,0.12012587229292478,0.0,0.11087217917166883,0.09773736371606044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20832320583491135,0.1103875518304104,0.09796791205517896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06558998034967563,0.0,0.1010921076330909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19478175907247255,0.0,0.10250450798731556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08469332007025064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345616538805325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19299191175107613,0.10641645112282537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426167328460083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13120740281598878,0.0,0.08128166810752258,0.059701086901102735,0.11767564857769147,0.09704830951046099,0.09783255053909393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001454758956964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08212647977081224,0.0,0.0,0.09491123721654267,0.0923858721843504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10397618856702463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593210834388404

healthanxiety,lelife,2019/01/24,"Contacting an Ex about STD Testing I've been dealing with healthy anxiety, particularly with being exposed to STDs (specifically HIV). I've only had sex (stupidly, unprotected) with one guy, an ex from two years ago. I realize what a huge mistake that was and I have since gotten tested for all STDs  and tested negative for HIV using the 4th generation test. Last time I was tested was Aug. 2018. However, I've had a long list of symptoms since the exposure, thus the anxiety. I haven't been able to put the fear and anxiety behind me. There hasn't been a day within the last two years that I haven't thought about having hiv. I understand that the tests are negative and I should believe the results, and I want to. I'm about to start a new stage in my life and need to desperately put this behind me (it's been legitimately driving me crazy). I can't eat, think/focus, sleep nowadays. 

I've come to the conclusion that perhaps the only thing I think would put my mind to rest is reaching out to my ex ( who I had the unprotected sex with) himself. The thing is I haven't talked to him in over a year and have no idea how I would go about talking about this to him. But if an awkward conversation is the price I have to pay for my sanity and control of my life back then I have to do it. How do you suggest I go about this?  Do I go straight to the point? I'd suggest him to get tested for confirmation. 

Please, any advice would mean the world.",3.9564136904761935,5.173287329861111,5.082182539682538,83.05250000000002,71.53472222222223,8.402380952380952,27.950396825396822,8.841846274778883,2.0185146825396827,1133,41,234,21,21,374,146,288,0.11,0.846,0.044,-0.9435,1,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,1,0,2,10,4,1,2,22,0,32,11,1,6,1,38,47,13,0,8,2,3,0,0,0,4,7,0,0,1,13,14,1,1,7,0,2,8,8,4,0,3,12,0,30,0,38,30,2,31,0,0,0,6,17,9,0,1,13,158,43,8,0.11851148838553476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115808054849922,0.10505328387974204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08059187603426453,0.0,0.2719828927041773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09112801929086918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335218642149316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10208715351980784,0.0,0.0,0.1329207114607757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07643010579785389,0.12218014070349405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212668390439122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333583725887393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061917361300142464,0.0,0.20205842984346292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11734500585134107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337850451193237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19320536110371836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16741633809559495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10487893788214668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12909375368517634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11966281944166553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08787476698425728,0.0,0.11445913397457652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08030645163146484,0.18026665449878895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13009002591528246,0.11203166282263397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574103367605856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19606785571288746,0.0,0.11859707596511795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388304145456467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12317881367102435,0.0,0.1905100904577988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15746753376369135,0.15187475294656885,0.0,0.0940848839164027,0.0691050019217491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23153700751978826,0.12337463894145878,0.0,0.10235587512838136,0.0,0.0,0.06990114637657484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525614832651093,0.0,0.0,0.2289525389055313
healthanxiety,Fromabrokentime,2019/01/24,"Can't stop worrying about oral cancer I am a 20 year old and I have pretty bad HA I've had it under control for a little while now until recently when I felt a few little lumps on my gums at first I thought maybe it's a canker sore or something but my anxiety got the best of me when I saw an ad about oral cancer and it kicked my into the deep end. Now I don't know how long they were there so it was just recently I discovered it but I thought for sure that I had oral cancer. I called my dentist asked for him to check it out just to be safe he said ok. I went in today got a couple of x ray's than he looked in my mouth with the mirror thing he said ""Your x ray's came back good and I don't see anything wrong it looks like it might be just bit of extra bone but you have nothing to worry about."" for some reason my anxiety won't let me accept that. I have been trying everything to accept hat my dentist said but for my anxiety tells me ""Maybe he missed it?"" Now have been trying everything I can to get my HA back under control but I know it's going to be incredibly difficult. So I would like to know if you have any advice that can help me I would like to hear it.

healthanxiety,throwmeintothecloth,2019/01/25,"Toenail Melanoma? This sounds so stupid, but I’m worried about toenail melanoma.  I recently removed my nail polish and noticed that on one of my toenails, a little less than half of it is a light brown color. The pigment starts from the edge of the nail so it’s not a sole brown line.  It just looks like half of my nail lengthwise is a darker shade. For reference I am under 30 and darker-skinned, and I’m fairly sure I’ve had this pigmentation for awhile and it’s been noticed by my derm, but since I’ve had my nails painted I’m worried that somehow it changed or it looks different than I remember. 

I know it’s more common on the thumbs, index fingers, big toes - and it’s not on either of those. My two pinky toenails also currently have some brown pigmentation basically covering the whole nail. In all three toenails have some funky darker pigmentation going on right now.  Admittedly this has been the first time I’ve cut my toenails in a little over a month so they were long. I also tend to wear heels frequently so I’m not sure if this pigmentation is more trauma based?

I’ve been to the derm a few times in the past year for cancer/mole related concerns so I’d hate to keep going back.

healthanxiety,Blinds59,2019/01/25,"Whilst falling asleep - jolted awake with panic. Any tips to overcome? Hi all,

I’m currently battling with myself, I’ve convinced myself I have something wrong with my heart due to some pains in my chest, despite seeing the doctor twice and them confirming it’s nothing to worry about. 

Whilst I’m up and about in the day I can deal with it and distract myself. However, I’ve found that almost every night as I’m falling asleep, just as I drift off; I have a feeling my heart has stopped/I’m having a heart attack and it holds me wide awake. 

I’m at wits end, and so done with being exhausted every day due to it taking hours each night to actually get to sleep.

My doctors haven’t been very useful with advice, so has anyone else had a similar experience and have any tips on how to get over this?

healthanxiety,Clairek97,2019/01/25,"Waiting on results, the last few anxious hours are the worst. I’ve been struggling with medical issues for a while now that are definitely exaggerated by health anxiety which has been hard in many ways. Mainly because I never know when I’m experiencing a real symptom or my anxiety is just getting the best of me. My doc wanted me to see a neurologist who ordered an MRI. I missed the call last night with what I thought would be results which left me waiting all night. I was so ready to call this morning and have my anxiety put to ease but all they said was the results were not specific enough and the neurologist wants to see them himself. So that brings me to now, about 10 am. At 11 I am planning to go grab the disk from the imaging center in my town and then bring it to drop off at my neurologist a little over an hour away. Then I have to drive home and wait for a call again. Ugh I’m so sick of the waiting and I’m scared it’s not a good sign that he needed to see it himself before giving me results.",4.24126907073509,5.051325762135924,5.270901525658807,83.48058252427188,70.50485436893204,8.021636615811373,29.277392510402212,8.192908349453996,1.8563936199722604,801,30,167,11,14,264,124,206,0.151,0.7959999999999999,0.053,-0.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,2,2,9,7,0,2,17,0,15,5,0,4,3,31,37,14,0,4,5,0,2,0,0,1,5,1,1,0,11,7,0,4,2,0,0,5,3,5,0,0,7,7,20,2,26,28,7,34,0,1,3,0,11,12,0,1,14,117,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30314417688343964,0.14922346781990198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12410237565468275,0.0,0.0,0.08052049574226029,0.0,0.1123983833759835,0.0,0.1386197165081738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4046342557928229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13648369977513536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06901127986215416,0.12671222559613682,0.07506947194148049,0.11079035413131896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832619194864065,0.0,0.0,0.14040489641900233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13249647679995086,0.0,0.26016297919997433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13786705595326576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259290100067012,0.2153410443536873,0.0,0.0,0.1435155614944862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13238831858747607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391795845252272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13306621284526038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09794264500025147,0.10187551808055996,0.0,0.0,0.24791398022744254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327863691103106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503466991506527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256473042568799,0.0,0.13224457119716185,0.0,0.3157745425884223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13808856088495075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13729150281666874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10486425969089568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15581954637553685,0.1048464480793654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938325473287954,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,wahtsup,2019/01/25,"Chest pains and limb numbness - Cardiac ischemia possible for F24? I'm female, 24 years old and I've been chronically experiencing most of the symptoms describing cardiac ischemia. For a few years, but more often lately. I have no issue of being overweight (rather almost underweight), and generally I don't seem like the type who'd have heart problems. I rarely smoke, don't drink. But I do go through a lot of emotional stress, am very depressed, and I don't move enough, spending a lot of time at home in bed. When I'm depressed, I often wake up full of anxiety, feeling like I'm almost having a heart attack.

I know that I should probably do an ECG asap to know for sure, but I will only be able to do it in a couple of months. But I was wondering if it's my heart or something else, because I feel like its unlikely for a woman of my age and complexion to have heart problems?

healthanxiety,tw1706,2019/01/25,"HPV Vaccination side effects? So yesterday I had myself vaccinated for HPV. My arm started aching immediately after the shot, which had never happened to me, usually my arm started to ache maybe 30 mins after the shot but I didn’t think anything of it. On the bus home from the hospital I was really drowsy and dizzy and stayed that way for a few hours. Today my arm still aches, usually for me my arm would’ve stopped aching by now, and my chest feels tight, maybe I’m over exaggerating but has anyone else had symptoms like these?",6.8059735973597375,7.1834830792079245,6.980940594059407,74.99471122112212,64.74257425742574,10.297689768976898,31.684818481848183,10.125756701596842,2.999929372937294,425,15,80,9,6,137,72,101,0.16899999999999998,0.8,0.03,-0.9178,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,5,0,6,6,5,1,1,11,12,6,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,3,0,2,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,5,2,11,1,12,7,1,19,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,15,48,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425464545283418,0.2088827678184647,0.16776270831593065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17030221949808466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10307976791658556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18027626907963426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044922221659317,0.0,0.20076498268794551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09959765678224383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4096175946158687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15723249085372654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13060050381645905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2885919884117808,0.2172919076507839,0.16280606019972496,0.17043943918629484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21189276253639427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13062782471394632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19323924247317667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4490548064342387,0.0,0.0,0.16181776053053787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448191422004849,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Julianacuc,2019/01/25,"17 and scared I'm dying Hey everyone, this might be a very disgusting post so consider yourself warned.
About a month ago I saw blood in my stool, went to the doctor and got told it was hemorroids, everything was fine up until this month, I feel bloated all the time, yesterday I saw blood actually mixed in with my poop and today my poop was super dark brown almost black.
I don't know what to do, I already went to the doctor last week because of heart palpitations, I was scared I had a heart problem but it was just my anxiety...I don't want to have to go to the doctor yet again over something that is going to end up being nothing, but this seems more real than the other things I've gone to the doctor for (headaches, heart palpitations, problems with period, etc)
Anybody have any advice on what to do?",4.094245283018868,5.559558125786165,4.8655503144654135,83.7787028301887,71.51572327044025,7.815723270440253,25.828616352201266,8.344100000000001,1.6180729559748428,638,20,125,10,12,206,101,159,0.096,0.879,0.025,-0.8321,0,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,1,5,7,1,2,9,0,16,11,7,0,1,18,30,7,1,3,3,0,1,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,10,5,0,0,3,0,0,5,2,5,0,0,13,5,11,2,22,14,3,25,0,0,4,0,2,6,0,3,13,80,21,4,0.0,0.0,0.11946006080164515,0.0,0.0,0.11962320152751416,0.10851412852896217,0.0,0.12258163682019628,0.0,0.13508876480102844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08324687121997505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0746234721739349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12704816569576768,0.0,0.0,0.5011906089766834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084239719176842,0.0,0.13652586037593895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169734437157008,0.11001933432285396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061897054172061115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13914332242733418,0.0,0.09790701512708824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4351895681691325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06727646517712131,0.0997851309973963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12986370846191972,0.0,0.0,0.19542208156454652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11746116206062067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11724039812286766,0.0,0.0,0.2342705772993606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13933586246691873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.245118934947291,0.0,0.0,0.11144265219626437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942415836142412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08132754906325662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07138157688735426,0.0,0.11603576629323928,0.1169734437157008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10100576976277534,0.07220394929217577,0.0,0.09819448747992048,0.0,0.0,0.2269611535907036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Hellblade999,2019/01/25,"Pulsatile tinnitus So over the last week or so I've noticed that for about 10-15 seconds each day, I've heard a pulsing sound in my ear that sounds like a fan whirring. At first I thought it was an external sound, but then I pinned it down to coming from inside my head when I was in the bathroom one time. I googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus, and it said the cause could be tumours, aneurysms, high blood pressure, hearing loss etc. 

I hear it in my right ear, and as I said it's normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. I've been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it; there seems to be no pattern to it. Which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant.  

I exercise regularly and do cardio, and I'm cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps. I've heard this can be a symptom of anxiety or can just be heightened awareness of my own body, which makes sense but don't exactly know what that means. You'd think I'd have noticed this before. 

Anyone experienced this before?

* Duration of complaint: 1 day

Recently, was doing a small club cleanup and we've found like 6-7 syringe needles (some covered w/ blood) during our beach cleanup. However, I didn't touch them with my paper gloves at all but I've used sticks to find them. I'm starting to feel a little paranoid/insecure that even though I didn't touch them at all, the club decided to keep going at it and we were still picking up sticks and cleaning the rocky side of the island. And I was wearing slippers during that cleanup and didn't get to wash my hands right away.

Can abandoned/old syringe needles give you HIVs? And is it only possible when injected? (I also probably should get blood tested if only I can convince my parents (they don't usually believe my suspicious concerns) to schedule an appointment)",3.6626000696136463,6.3427975502958605,3.997117995127045,84.11156978767839,76.45562130177515,6.816707274625827,31.242951618517232,7.928766900206844,2.505330386355725,722,36,125,12,17,225,112,169,0.034,0.938,0.027000000000000003,-0.2824,2,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,2,2,4,0,5,2,0,0,6,0,13,9,4,2,2,21,24,11,0,2,2,1,5,1,0,1,3,0,1,1,4,8,1,1,4,3,0,1,4,0,0,0,7,5,17,2,13,16,3,19,0,0,0,3,12,10,0,2,9,69,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14432909876721128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16956608800517456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2033381812807033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163941111772569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11920476629122125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09125567326580512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1649546594068044,0.0,0.0,0.19788605565056092,0.0,0.0,0.18858579769684236,0.34626406276945976,0.1025704513598548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16041814738438095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08817298883244619,0.18088750648033228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37876498389528707,0.0,0.0,0.27452502919174765,0.0,0.0,0.2004007207533992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20346310681961505,0.0,0.0,0.1945870323690393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17820137229309846,0.0,0.0,0.15412819486230306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12774406042001318,0.0,0.14413087005882372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17731983344231145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15587602535639522,0.19877226890714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21977496463096252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Found out my grandma has cancer through my mother. She told grandma not to freak out because she had the same thing last year and had it removed. Wait, what?! She didn’t tell me she had cancer. She just mentioned surgery. Now two women have had the exact same cancer...which means I’m probably going to get it too. Actually I’m like 100% sure I will because one of my greatest fears (aside from pregnancy) is to die by cancers hand. Oh and plot twist...not having children actually increases my risk. Awesome.

Been like this ever since fucking last year when I had a lump in my jawline. It turned out to be a swollen salvitory gland or something and basically nothing.

My doctor told me it could be cause for concern when he felt it (fuck him) so we looked shit up and it caused me to be concerned lmao. 

It came back tho but I think this is just a swollen lymph node because I think I have bronchitis or the cold or something who knows but still I get overly paranoid especially after drinking coffee I prolly gonna have to quit it.",0.3754354354354348,2.689913000000004,1.968018018018018,95.59755255255257,87.91891891891892,4.6402402402402405,21.060060060060056,6.139981653823899,0.1009042042042041,556,19,123,5,18,180,97,148,0.204,0.721,0.075,-0.9722,0,0,4,0,0,2,8.0,1,0,0,1,10,8,6,1,4,1,10,13,2,2,1,25,30,14,2,2,9,1,1,1,0,2,7,0,0,0,11,7,1,0,4,1,0,1,2,7,0,0,5,3,15,1,10,19,0,14,0,0,1,3,6,4,4,3,10,71,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12471823329896994,0.0,0.09887279646262913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855083021088187,0.0,0.3332386621952061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12949981068983674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1683331941256901,0.0,0.0,0.16601384131131805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15888972117406214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467150044854184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15573299768792714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4498410377585488,0.16948078037863226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17944515356310706,0.0,0.08913833750161614,0.13221088029924769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07924046846656906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362032668496079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1899612654087633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15563083880114836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17251474861399546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16238586773134053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16649122382594336,0.13416969205254542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2497318509459911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12952943770181746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2078564970204668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1549846335892553,0.0,0.0,0.17642199475535542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463560999934647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444850509504654
healthanxiety,lahdhdc,2019/01/26,"How do I handle moving forward when it was actually something this time? I know no one can answer this and I’m rambling. I’ve had health/injury anxiety most of my life. It’s progressed from simple illness anxiety as a kid (I was genuinely terrified of throwing up in school. Still am but as an adult I feel that control to get myself out of a situation when I feel sick) to now as a 45 year old person worrying about more serious things. A few years ago I was convinced I was having a heart attack. You know the drill, typical symptoms but all the while I kinda knew I wasn’t. But something was wrong. Turns out I have Graves’ disease/hyperthyroid. It’s auto immune so now the statistic that one autoimmune usually means multiple has freaked me out. I have symptoms but they are not typical hyperthyroid sometimes and now I have this history of that one time it actually WAS something. Graves’ disease isn’t that serious considering the big picture, though. And I did something incredibly stupid. I did a 23 and me health analysis thing. Major dumb. I don’t even have the results yet but here I go. I guarantee I will suddenly have 100 more diseases by the end of next month. And I know that one time, I was right. Something was wrong.  Any kind of therapy or acknowledgement of my fears is strictly forbidden in my family. We just don’t do that. We suck it up and move on. If my husband only could hear my inner thoughts I think he’d leave me. Or have me committed at least.

healthanxiety,JimoneJon,2019/01/26,"Coping Idk if this will be helpful to anyone else but I've been a hypochondriac my whole life, since very young. Over the last year I decided to improve my anxiety problems. I had an experience recently that kind of personified how I went about learning to cope better. Basically, when I was in high school, smoking weed usually gave me panic attacks until after it actually set in. After i took a hit, I had a hard time accepting the reality of the situation, which is the key point I am making here. As I have improved with my anxiety issues over the past year, I took up smoking weed again for a while, with very little anxiety. A couple weeks ago, I smoked more than I usually did, so the set in was much more intense. Although it felt good, I noticed there was some anxiety building up in the back of my mind. I began to panic. But I decided to try just letting go, and accepting the reality of what was happening. No more anxiety, I was able to enjoy the drug. So basically, what worked for me was accepting that something bad may happen to me and I just have to accept that and deal with it.",5.238269617706237,6.04994549295775,6.7970925553319965,73.42911971830989,68.24882629107982,10.404963112005364,32.58517773306506,10.451354775682146,3.5549318578135485,862,37,160,23,14,297,125,213,0.153,0.6920000000000001,0.155,0.5407,0,0,3,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,2,11,13,1,2,15,0,18,2,0,2,0,25,29,14,0,2,5,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,10,6,0,0,8,0,0,4,1,5,0,0,16,2,23,8,31,8,6,36,0,0,0,0,3,11,0,3,19,122,33,3,0.11569350962176787,0.0,0.1129001764014445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255531573277192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4425260909679559,0.0,0.0,0.0808955919356253,0.11854167263393285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131618069252099,0.0,0.08896116756498072,0.09659924801305088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023215075271187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280126678707642,0.0,0.0,0.11927492833508273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13416774090290068,0.0,0.09664708182208204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11317045225405335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1110839124019797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06575128767602617,0.09703822682935344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2046147769496926,0.0,0.10363866009992252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07754692078495383,0.12223654492984865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12075396592767347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12047698687414725,0.0,0.09430565174877377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11830445206335193,0.08171774730941612,0.0,0.1159552904165383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07722631604735536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11681746420570648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08504804143783005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13171782751580147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714828119639058,0.0,0.0,0.11044254592746007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10936776203964282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070306395826733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11423338338249801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11708800831892308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09570286670286672,0.1300443521829005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906651598031654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06746181584301174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2570794922121372,0.07854829871175605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2548401115849062,0.19091852368492984,0.0,0.0,0.09280235489365984,0.0,0.0,0.1072490425030526,0.0,0.12916767183928382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08422625290769635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14900565407141508

healthanxiety,altrdmind,2019/01/27,"Venting A little info- new to the community. I’m 18f, weight is 165 at 5’4. Back in September I got diagnosed with a stomach infection called cdiff. It’s been a whirlwind since then. If you read up on it it’s super hard to get rid of mainly because elderly people primarily get it and it’s a spore firming bacteria. It can kill you. It caused me tremendous anxiety. But of course with my luck, I contracted it. I was on antibiotics for two months, now I’m waiting to retest my stool again. I have to wait a month at least in case I get a false positive stool test. Everything has been normal bathroom-wise for a month. So I thought I had gotten rid of it, and was excited to go back to the doctor. Until yesterday, my lose stools came back. Again. And now I’m through the roof just upset. If I test positive for it again, (I’ve tested positive twice now.) then I go in for a fecal matter transplant. Also for the past few months I’ve been experiencing this sternum pain, literally in my chest bone. Only with certain arm movements. Anywho, moral of this is that I just want to be okay. It’s affecting me, my relationship, and everything around me.

healthanxiety,Thix,2019/01/27,"Throat/Chest Palpatations, Left Eye twitch and weakness almost everywhere So I had been doing great with my health anxiety for nearly a year. I actually haven’t visited this sub reddit in a few months as things were smooth sailing. It all started last Sunday and it’s only gotten worse. I’ve been having this palpitation that happens probably 3-4 times ever single hour along with my eye twitching constantly/pain in back of my head. It feels like I constantly have to burp/throw up. Anytime I eat I feel sick and either want to puke or use the bathroom. Accompanied with these symptoms is general weakness/fatigue everywhere. The pressure/pain in my chest/stomach refuses to go away. No amount of pepto or antacids works.

I’ve posted on this subreddit before that I am terrified of having a heart condition. I’ve had a lot of testing done after one incident back in 2015 and doctors have said I’m fine. I don’t know what any of this could be. Maybe it’s something they didn’t find with my heart? Maybe it’s something else? But it’s been a weak and it’s just been so damn frustrating. Any thoughts, opinions and responses are more than welcome.",4.2926000485083655,6.5911973917050695,4.742551540140678,81.40300024254185,72.77880184331798,8.070725200097016,29.39340286199369,8.841846274778883,2.588517050691244,922,39,164,19,19,292,143,217,0.142,0.7979999999999999,0.061,-0.9549,0,0,2,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,1,1,6,8,2,0,7,0,21,15,5,1,2,31,33,12,0,2,5,0,3,1,0,0,9,1,0,0,16,11,1,1,5,0,0,2,4,4,0,1,12,6,13,4,25,19,7,24,0,0,2,0,5,9,1,5,13,105,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.13397032121460106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13747106061733316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867169663670052,0.0,0.10502262165120993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12898374276946314,0.21112732635471648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11681939280043364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14835627464583515,0.0,0.10961087272959702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14051697785805728,0.0,0.14049018243548295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14047679134289198,0.11468397135287825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12418210959929647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13883080544279094,0.09807640567197866,0.0,0.0,0.12547596991741872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07802220874225459,0.0,0.0,0.1513571574060671,0.0,0.0,0.12140064022456895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14089397971895745,0.14592749693747198,0.0,0.32536668654845396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13519803553414286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544822587130091,0.11190556879390208,0.0,0.0,0.1491605150148582,0.0,0.0,0.06707049885135008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11671476698788688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2758423972688713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10957954844464518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302784453082244,0.1044114013763388,0.2921617618907937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13148104638861846,0.0,0.1480164107377145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305894386505594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21137734476021133,0.0,0.0,0.09717100408095113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426916430110259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09120602985203463,0.0,0.0,0.10898892649175733,0.08005196649181595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11857013035461456,0.0,0.0,0.08097422866456754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09994508880680487,0.0,0.1399051068408897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840701571518447
healthanxiety,pozyxoo,2019/01/27,"Lower left back pains, muscular or organs? Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

For the past week ive been dealing with pain in my lower left back and lower left side. I dont know what do think of it, my health anxiety says organs and i say muscles. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to do some stretches on my left side and i felt that it did hurt and something stretched. Then i tried the same stretches on my right side and i didnt feel anything (so i guess tha side is fine). The stretches just gives SOME relief for a few minutes  (3-4) but i cant convince myself that its my muscles doing it. I think its my kidney, so stomach, some else organ in my body thats making the pain. Do u guys know anything about this cuz its really freaking me out?",1.56119540229885,3.806282268965518,2.6655172413793125,93.16954022988509,81.48275862068967,4.694252873563218,22.080459770114945,5.6839178017228535,0.1582321839080456,559,18,115,3,15,178,86,145,0.166,0.8190000000000001,0.014,-0.9565,3,0,1,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,0,6,8,0,0,5,0,11,8,4,2,0,23,20,11,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,4,2,0,1,11,7,0,0,6,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,4,4,19,3,11,16,5,23,0,1,0,0,6,18,0,5,5,75,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533901577995567,0.2841688005406573,0.0,0.0,0.08945216977514689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19244909093931428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17982599505063265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12988437984470985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12055109695352274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13704268218796192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976811463535538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05912400863374302,0.0,0.11227244217097436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11217121469864733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288130751777888,0.11578042958492166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242925669315796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12517743851476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12852483405503495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5081850558699598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07805259028983905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3732696315645663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116242134683308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490922293756057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09985874190198636,0.0,0.18597702032193472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09001947310411834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14984978705897456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1587774347167643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09379528320378977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841688005406573,0.0
healthanxiety,yikesmate,2019/01/27,Something going wrong actually made me better After I had my son via emergency c section everything that could have went wrong did. I lost a lot of blood I got numerous infections and the scariest of all I developed a pulmonary embolism. If you had told me that a few years ago I would have probably died on the spot. I've always been obsessive over my health full blown panic attacks complete mental breakdowns thinking I had cancer or hiv or a brain aneurysm just waiting to take me out. I'm not saying I'm totally over my health anxiety because I'm not I still panic now and again but no where near as bad as before. The worst happened and I'm still here!

healthanxiety,BrownIndianGirl,2019/01/27,"Very worried about my sister My sister (26) has been suffering from pretty chronic neck pain for over 3 years now.  She had an MRI 3 years ago, which was normal. We tried alternate therapies including massages. They gave her a bit of relief but the pain would return every now and then. She then moved to a cold country away from us. The past summer there was quite pain free for her, but in the last 3-4 months her neck has been severely aching again, and after a recent long flight it has spread to her upper back as well. She has an appointment with a doctor about 10 days from now. I’m extremely close to her and she lives more than 8000 miles away from me. I feel helpless and anxious, and i’m imagining all sorts of worst case scenarios :( 

If her MRI was clean 3 years ago, it can’t be cancer or something now, even though the pain is worse, right?

healthanxiety,6BigTony9,2019/01/27,"I don't know what to do Ever since I got a ""stomach bug"" in september, I've had SIGNIFICANT problems with not just my stomach but everywhere. It started where I felt no appetite and gagged at the thought of food, along with a really bad taste in my mouth/rough feeling all throughout my mouth. That's where the problems began. After the days that followed I had HORRIBLE stomach problems, nausea and diarrhea. That lasted a few days before kind of subsiding. After it let I had a sitting feeling in my body that something is very wrong. I had weird cold symptoms and a ""sick"" feeling that I was an still am unable to describe. That lasted another week so I thought okay, it all must be over now surely right?
This is where the real problems began. The stomach problems came back in full force after a long period of having a gurgling feeling in my stomach and intestines. This is about a couple weeks after the first stomach bug so I imagine fairs fair people can have stomach bugs that come back for another round. That left and I was left with a near constant rumbling feeling in my intestines so I start to imagine it's IBS. Real problems began when I started feeling feverish every few nights and my sex drive greatly increased for some reason I can't explain, before giving way to more horrible stomach problems and diarrhea again. Now finally for the past month I've felt my mental state worsening and I'm starting to worry that I have bipolar due to me feeling tired and unable to do anything every few days then a cycle of feeling overly happy and my sex drive increasing. But something that I'm unable to reconcile with the bipolar theory is that at the end of it it's often accompanied by very real physical symptoms. This is turning into me rambling but my problems have become so bizarre yet serious that I'm unable to relate to other people's ""simple"" health anxiety where they worry about cancer or something easy to ""identify"" as a problem by themselves. I don't even know what I'm meant to worry about here. All I know is I feel awful reccuring stomach problems that are somehow accompanied by me feeling like I'm losing my mind when they begin. I'm so frustrated that it's become so hard to articulate my specific yet horrible problems.",5.787468553459121,7.261534004716985,6.369641509433965,74.56844025157233,67.4433962264151,8.294842767295599,34.88805031446541,8.648137234880735,3.228965974842767,1814,88,289,28,30,591,196,424,0.249,0.665,0.086,-0.9982,1,0,3,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,2,2,29,23,1,0,21,2,27,25,13,1,6,71,66,24,0,12,6,0,14,1,0,1,8,0,0,0,27,18,2,0,23,0,0,7,5,17,0,1,16,16,34,6,49,47,11,71,0,1,1,2,4,20,0,4,42,211,61,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309126775670209,0.047753701750643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0513691088433036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959994257964484,0.052120900587595616,0.0,0.13788339991506898,0.10623536824304466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06933828383103989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07139569737261406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05377219978749937,0.0,0.06745747897821662,0.0,0.0,0.06907026372652061,0.0,0.12077371472438472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05528857128487386,0.0,0.0,0.04123004246013209,0.0564655055390359,0.105188751064892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31563127889410325,0.044595262921441114,0.119872435329984,0.06838174281619518,0.0,0.05309728058530077,0.07548257818927033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059882177762610365,0.0,0.0,0.04992566578591045,0.06882197796012822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06645083055419204,0.055919071951469855,0.0,0.0,0.06635311570409293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500432648411637,0.10291874319722076,0.10176674458132798,0.0,0.0,0.13564633285670386,0.06383211786732408,0.0,0.030496901982234183,0.0,0.0,0.055242711809035686,0.0,0.06983577579614539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06290806766154391,0.0,0.06302980161851822,0.0,0.04982573270523034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05858009739775495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059590163229308026,0.0865529999871657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6570380060913835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21315435954671375,0.039990004708936315,0.06418161364739633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053309210832656564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05163725084789605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14416966344706106,0.0,0.0,0.17673431017949814,0.0,0.04985137823955211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05883328077373271,0.1297635510430862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09911435475482958,0.0,0.07174647279448816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678986935044967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10301162377545997,0.0,0.04954875989375939,0.10014451278241268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901818653510144,0.0,0.0,0.06825014793661126,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,LFC5X,2019/01/28,"First time questions and help Sorry if I mess this up it’s my first time posting on reddit and I need help.

A little bit of background :

When I was 16 I had a seizure caused by a perforated eardrum I was on a life support for two days.

Following my seizure I sort of got depressed and ended up putting on a lot of weight and never socialised with friends (only on games) I honestly left my house about 40 times in 6 years.

Five years ago my dad had a heart attack which left him on all sorts of medications and has a lasting effect on his heart.

In January 2017 my mum got diagnosed with oesophageal cancer they said they caught it early and she would survive but by the time march came she had gone from 55kg to 15kg all of the time me and my father was caring for her and watching her deteriorate. She died in the living room looking like which I can only describe as the worst thing I’ve ever seen other members of the family who was there said they’ve seen multiple people die of that horrible disease and my mums was the worst.

After my mum died I took over full time carer of my brother who had quadriplegic cerebral palsy, epilepsy , severe scoliosis a collapsed lung and can not communicate.

In 2018 around November I noticed a small lump on one of my testicles which caused me to be concerned and worry about it a lot, this was later cleared up by an ultrasound to be nothing thankfully.

I’ve been doing fine but recently over christmas an incident happened which I think may have broken? Me mentally. I know this seems trivial but I wanted a peaceful Christmas but my father invited my sister and her family for Christmas dinner and said he would cook, on Christmas Eve he says he’s not cooking so I begin to panic I stayed up  all night cooking meats and making sure everything was perfect for when they arrived. When dinner was just about ready to be served I got the potatoes off the stove and went to empty the water now this thing was pretty heavy and I needed a hand to drain it correctly, I asked my sister to hold the lid so I could tilt the pan to drain. She said ok and I began to tilt the pan the lid cane flying off and all the potatoes went down the drain and was ruined. I can honestly say I’ve never felt anything like that moment in my life it felt like I stood still for an hour but in reality it was five seconds while my brain tried to process what the fuck just happened. Then it settled and I just lost it, I began crying and punching doors then went in to the room with my brother and just kept crying. For me as silly as it sounded Christmas was ruined I was down for like three or four days until I recovered mentally.


Then on New Year’s Eve my father had too much to drink and basically collapsed and smashed his head on to the floor ( I thought he was dead as he wasn’t breathing for a solid 40 seconds) and didn’t wake up for ten minutes.


Then January came and I had some sort of panic attack in which I couldn’t breathe and it felt like my brain was frozen. Ambulance came did tests and said everything was fine I just thought I had a flu or something. Since then I’ve been in to hospital four times all of the time all the tests came back clear apart from an ecg which indicated there may be a slight problem. Doctor said he was 90% happy for me to go home and asked me do I have stress at home which I then told him about my mum etc and then he put it down to stress/ anxiety.


My height is 6 ft 1 and 145kg (really fat)


Since going to the hospital I can’t stop thinking I have something wrong with me every little thing I google comes up with cancer or some sort of brain disease, I had heartburn recently so the doctor prescribed me omezaprole/prose to combat it as well as setraline/Zoloft or my anxiety. I’ve had what can only be described as “the rattles” and haven’t felt like eating at all which is making me feel worse than ever. Does anyone have these symptoms?


Whole body shakes and feels cold
A cough that bring up phlegm sometimes 
Back pain and rib pain 
Cold hands and feet 
Trouble sleeping 
Constipation
When I breathe it feels like I’m wheezing  or my stomach is gurgling


Honestly I’m at wits end and my doctor keeps saying nothing is wrong just wanted a bit of insight to some of you anxiety veterans.

I’m also really scared to take setraline as the side effects look horrendous. Thanks guys !

healthanxiety,SadBirchwood,2019/01/28,"So...anybody with intrusive fears about specific body parts being injured? Feeling a little down right now, so I figured I might as well lurk out of the shadows and find if there’s anybody dealing with similar stuff.

For something like 2.5 years I’ve been dealing with recurring and everyday fear of having my ears and eyes (yes it’s that specific) damaged. Incomplete list of stuff I fear:

\- lasers (big one), yes in every shop as well

\- hands - mine and other people

\- cigarettes

\- gestures (hugging, patting, even walking to fast)

\- knives

\- forks (even when eating by myself)

\- every sharp corner

\- barbed wire

\- loud sounds

\- other bright lights

\- list goes on and on

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot help myself but look for dangers around me, spot them, and if I feel that something might have happened, I seek reassurance - either by somehow “repeating” the thing or googling stuff or asking others if they hit me. I somehow think I know that nothing happened or couldn’t have happened but I still cannot let it go for some time after the trigger and in the worst cases cannot let it go for a day or something. There are multiple episodes every day resulting in my every day being disturbed, being avoiding and distant (pubs are so distressing...). The weird part is that I do get physical sensations - for example right now I feel slight pain in my ear and a pressure because somebody patted me quite abruptly on the shoulder. I know they’re not real but they feed my anxiety and worrying.

I’m on 20mg of paroxetine it’s helped somehow but not significantly. Looking into psychotherapy options right now.

Is there anybody else with similar issues? How you’re doing? What’s your story?

And it goes without saying crossed fingers for everybody struggling here on this sub - and even though i don’t post often thanks for this community!

(Just as I was writing this I remembered there’s a grocery store at this street and now I worry if I didn’t see a laser from it by peripheral vision.

healthanxiety,yourfavmurse,2019/01/28,"Worried about lymph node but it also may just be a ingrown hair cyst I think its been there for awhile but I could be wrong, I just know I've fixated on it this past week. Its located right above my right testicle, and it feels hard and doesn't move. its probably between 1-2cm and I can't tell if its a cyst as the hair there does look a little red by the root. Ive now convinced myself I have cancer or HIV and feel awful. I did set up my physical for next week, but some aide to my anxiety in the the mean time would help.

healthanxiety,Solarkanite,2019/01/28,"Need some Help, Was doing so good too. Hey guys! I was doing so good, it had been weeks that I had finally got over my HA for the most part. However, today, I went down the anxiety spiral again. I was itching my back and decided to look at my moles since they seemed to be itchy. Nothing too crazy just a few itches. I've read about melanoma before and kind of disregarded it because although I have a good 60+ moles none of them showed signs of melanoma. Recently I have been getting some new moles, which isn't that crazy in itself but there seemed to be a lot more popping up. So anyway I unfortunately got on the Google and did some research on different types of melanoma and what to look for than preceded to check myself. I noticed two somewhat suspect moles. One is slight red/brown and the other one appears to be a kinda line. I read that linear melanoma are of the types and it looks a little similar. I'm freaking out because I don't have health insurance, and don't think I can pay for a dermatologist out of pocket since I'm somewhat young and on a fixed income. Any advice on how I can handle this or anything I can do to ease my anxieties?",4.865324675324672,5.491901246753252,5.43418181818182,83.53127272727275,69.0,8.411082251082254,29.252813852813848,8.447377352677275,1.9525639826839831,912,32,186,13,15,294,135,231,0.07200000000000001,0.8420000000000001,0.086,0.2781,4,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,2,0,12,6,0,0,12,1,25,3,2,1,0,31,39,15,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,11,10,0,1,5,3,2,2,4,1,0,3,11,3,20,5,29,25,11,23,0,0,3,0,5,12,0,12,9,133,31,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13562390288124734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09438190445779672,0.0,0.21234781681507486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11421227794622853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10672088097914896,0.0,0.16921009325187433,0.0,0.1180999989945927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14500592577788576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15203757263522982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07251200451053326,0.0,0.0,0.34923119848844125,0.22200595438728293,0.0,0.0,0.13742384066294858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475271941452421,0.0,0.0,0.09302795736516747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14452834342052448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13910396059501984,0.0,0.0,0.3496457313242343,0.0,0.0,0.11799422624521973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10291096658716722,0.0,0.134044168949705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331726707879821,0.1580132430577432,0.0,0.0,0.18809528250721175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502959576622828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2776549557190668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13703830160394662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526982599578461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2296169109808425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08893097621936599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13155661525147974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13557758422750832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132890161268152,0.0,0.0,0.12865964570143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,darksideofthem00n,2019/01/28,"Just found this sub and so thankful I’m not alone with my delusions. I’ve had health anxiety my entire life. I’ve had every type of cancer you can imagine, diabetes, all the syndromes, etc. 
I have PCOS (legitimate) and recently went to a specialist for it, they took my testosterone levels via blood test and they were supppeerr high, he said the only time it’s this high is when there’s a potential tumor on the ovary or adrenal gland. 
So naturally I’ve been an anxious mess the last 4 days, living on Xanax. I’m getting scans and tests done within the next two weeks, to not only rule that out but to see how my fertility is. 
He said that most cases the tumors are benign but us hypochondriacs don’t hear the positive statistics, we hear the negative and nothing else. Just had to share. I’m trying to think positive thoughts via my therapist but we all know how that goes!

healthanxiety,bumberbeven,2019/01/28,"Fitbit heart monitor is terrible for my health anxiety. I had a panic attack in Oct.  It lasted for 12 hours.  I ended up in the emergency room.  Had blood work, ECG, and chest xray.  Everything came back good.  In fact I wasn't even worried I could have a heart condition until I was checked for it.  

After that I was convinced something was wrong with my brain.  I thought I had a brain tumor, stroke, etc.  After a while I calmed down on that, still going to see a neurologist though, because I suffer from a swaying dizziness when I'm anxious.

Now I'm obsessed about my heart.  I got a fitbit for my birthday and I religiously check my heart rate all day long.  Checking it makes it spike.  If I'm resting I can usually get it down to the 60s, but if I keep checking it it spikes up in the 90s.  When walking around it ranges from (had palpitations typing this) 110-140 depending on how anxious I am.  If I don't look at it it goes down, if I do man oh man does it rise.  During a panic attack it was 150.  I sat down and calmed myself down and it dropped to 100.

healthanxiety,uglydork,2019/01/28,"What helped me after 27 years? I have nevr been to this group because it would have made things worse but I am here now.
I had the worst panic attack of my life at 54. Ambulance - hospital - I knew I was having a heart attack. I couldnt feel my arms - heart racing - gave me nitro - 
I run marathons - eat well, take care of myself. I have not run in 2 months because my heart rate going up was freaking me out.
I have been to been to psychiatrist - emd helped but came back.  I have always resisted drugs because the thought of taking medicine made me more anxious.
Cut back to hospital - gave me xanax - I calmed down. EKG - Blood Work - Chest x-ray - nothing wrong go home.
Doctor gave me 10 Xanax just in case - woke up the next day anxious - took a pill (I hate drugs and for years wouldn't even consider it)  
I felt amazing all day - never had any anxious thoughts. Took another yesterday morning - same thing - all day no thoughts at all.  That is my best 2 days in 27 years - I felt normal.  It does make me sleepy and I see my psychiatrist  for the first time in 2 years tonight and I am going to ask what my best med treatment is.  I dont like the habit forming nature of Xanax but I will discuss it
Try the drugs - they work!

healthanxiety,davidkellar123,2019/01/28,"Head pain!!!!!! Someone please help..... For the past three weeks I have been experiencing the strangest head pains ever. Shooting pains around my head that move around and are different each time (sometimes its the same spot-not always) A lot of it occurs behind my ears as well.  The head pain is debilitating when it comes on, feels like i’m being stabbed in the head (but at the same time is kind of dull) Its a pulsating feeling and doesn’t normally last that long. This is happening every single day- No exaggeration and has sometimes been accompanied by a dull “normal” headache. I went to the ER, they took a regular CT and said it was normal. 
The head pain will come suddenly, last a few minutes and then (most of the time go) however one night i had a pulsating dull stabbing pain for about an hour....
I took a Tylenol and It eventually went away until about 9 hours later when the aching pain returned.  I haven’t ever experienced headaches or pain like this.. and its every day for weeks now...I am also getting weird sensations all around my head like burning pains and hot/cold pains aswell. 

I do have health anxiety and have experienced shooting like pains in my head from panic attacks, however this is not the same thing. These are real headaches unfortunately...

because of these symptoms though, I have convinced and self diagnosed myself with a brain aneurysm thats about to rupture at any given moment.  this is the worst part. I have no history of brain aneurysms in my bloodline, but somehow have convinced myself I have one. I know I had a normal CT , and that reassured me a bit but then i read somewhere they aren’t always caught and you need to have a CT with dye to catch them. (cue the anxiety again) 

I just want to know what these types of pains can come from? I don’t understand.....any ideas? and any ideas on how to cop with this/has anyone else ever been afraid of this?

healthanxiety,skittlespox18,2019/01/28,"Doctor doesn't know what's wrong/MRI canceled:( Over the past month I've experienced pulsatile tinnitus in one ear along with ear and headaches. Some days I feel no symtoms, others it's horrible but the pulsing sound remains. I also feel this weird tingling on the side of my head (same as the effected ear). I also have this ""weird"" feeling, like I'm on a strong pain pill. Though, when I go outside I don't feel nearly as bad honestly, being inside starts alot of my symtoms. The doctor believes it's idiopathic intracranial Hypertension or a venal issue. May I add that when I press on the area around my jugular, the sound fades or if I lay on the side that pulses it all goes away as well. I have yet to have a MRI, as it was canceled😔 I'm scared it's a tumor, please help. My mind has been racing for a week on what this may be.

healthanxiety,lindseyotts,2019/01/28,"Tender spot on top back of head after strain...scared I haven’t had to post in any anxiety subreddit as often as I used to but I guess one never really is cured of it are they.

So to put it politely I had to strain to use the restroom tonight.
About 30 minutes later I start getting this headache on the top right of my head. It’s a numb pain until I touch or put pressure on it and it becomes more sharp.

My aneurysm fear is STRONG tonight. I wouldn’t be as scared if it weren’t for my ~going to the bathroom~ but now all I can imagine is a blood vessel stretched to its limit somewhere in the top right of my head. 
I even feel a bit of throbbing when I lay down.

healthanxiety,sil3ntwarrior,2019/01/29,"If you need someone to vent to. Hello all,

I hope the rules of this subreddit allow this.

I'm a 31 year old male with ADHD, anxiety and health anxiety.

My work place is closed for the winter months so I have a ton of free time. 

I will state that I am not a doctor, I can't give you medical advice but I do have time. I can promise you I will read whatever you send me, it will stay between us and I will just try and respond the best as I can. I will be an ear, I will only be able to give my personal experiences and not a diagnosis.  I don't have any answers to how you are feeling, but if you need to talk to someone I'm here.

Send me a wall of text, no need for TL;DR.

healthanxiety,CantFindMyChandelier,2019/01/29,"Convinced myself I have Huntington's disease The rational side of me knows that these symptoms have either been there for a while or they can easily be explained by any number of other less serious causes. Not to mention that as far as I know, *no one in my family has this disease.*

I was reading about Lewy body dementia and someone had described it as being a mix of Parkinson's, dementia, and Huntington's, the last of which I'd never heard of. So I went to learn about it and since I'm me, I started drawing parallels between the symptoms and things I've either been experiencing or that I wasn't experiencing until they were suggested.

Firstly, I'm in the typical age range when symptoms manifest. My confusion, occasional inability to understand things, indecisiveness, occasional problems with concentration, forgetfulness and fatigue must be due to this disease, not because I never get enough sleep. My bouts of dizziness/vertigo are the coordination problems, even though they're most likely a mix of exhaustion and severe tension headaches. I've noticed lately my index finger on my right hand sometimes twitches when I hold it just right on my mouse, never mind the fact that I've had that happen before with other parts of me if I position myself a certain way. Fidgeting must be a symptom too, even though I've fidgeted my WHOLE LIFE. Me being freezing cold must be the telltale tremors! And the anxiety and depression I've had for what feels like forever MUST be Huntington's too, right? Muscle stiffness can't possibly be due to me being out of shape! My inability to remember a word now and again or have words come out coherently must be from illness and not the fact that my brain to mouth filter has always been haywire. I have issues swallowing and breathing that *could* be due to Huntington's... or, you know, the esophagus problems I've been having.

Also read that one possible symptom is ""visual disturbances"" and lately I've been experiencing what looks like rippling water in my left eye. I realize that could be any number of things and generally as long as my vision itself is okay, it's nothing major. But if I was thinking rationally, I wouldn't be posting here.

And while the disease seems to be hereditary, all I had to do was read something about how only a majority of cases are inherited, implying that some people (1%-3% of cases) can still develop it even with no family history.

Not to mention that practically all these symptoms can be caused by *ANXIETY* too. Never mind I had a CT about a year ago (when many of these same things were happening) that was normal. Never mind it's rare (something like 15,000 people in the entire US have it). NOPE, must be Huntington's!",6.563896613190727,8.026404296969698,7.203900772430185,69.3450668449198,65.62626262626263,10.34878193701723,34.76084373143196,10.46071229359064,4.056407011289363,2177,100,350,56,34,718,239,495,0.08900000000000001,0.861,0.05,-0.9515,1,0,2,0,0,0,66.0,1,1,2,1,24,18,0,4,21,1,59,22,8,3,16,85,77,37,0,15,14,0,4,4,0,7,12,2,0,0,34,20,2,2,11,3,1,2,15,11,0,3,19,12,37,7,51,33,13,45,0,2,2,0,9,15,0,11,30,271,71,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664630663405323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05995951256632855,0.06238732055959589,0.0,0.0,0.10197459813831057,0.0,0.11471522750924976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04570561316661514,0.0,0.06380036515894656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08328314573719485,0.0,0.08369973248127778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15404517654369404,0.0,0.06458651273262564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11972693125508435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06457804632393381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07747184276458438,0.0,0.1485658763919719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14136430592554627,0.0,0.037910897626784484,0.05356397037638076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06377585819703739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03917267066523024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13260478403768322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825707318034908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12361708734628372,0.06111670315362284,0.16915586441045888,0.0,0.08146331783714901,0.0,0.05295885466119251,0.14652095736943274,0.0,0.0,0.0663527645091526,0.0629622509869071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601545853227289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22711782859117846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2891365097554152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07346207108438847,0.07194297288566827,0.08536242754324642,0.0,0.0,0.10161344462995957,0.05702379865942105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811933705537648,0.0,0.1039599729564642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16905182412053488,0.07180775871181476,0.0,0.0,0.21523014281766792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22499349340229888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493493812101073,0.1920912314067176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06825673750039216,0.0,0.08470327998710643,0.0,0.06202219683303226,0.0,0.07503168903016816,0.0,0.06352822730223065,0.11544274849184083,0.07415470536478992,0.0,0.053069489530878255,0.0,0.059877161212144994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4675822418347498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19924698698608498,0.04804258090634635,0.14733010698960924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07805426455865998,0.09018875025825893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05951368224492945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950493181077635,0.0,0.08370974708786448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048283078263188485
healthanxiety,amstackhouse87,2019/01/29,"Shortness of breath for only seconds at a time.. For as long as I can remember I’ve been getting these weird feelings in my chest that feel like I completely lose my breath. It only lasts for about 10 seconds then stops, but it’s a STRONG sensation. It feels like when you jump into extremely cold water and it takes your breath away- except I’m always just sitting there doing nothing when it hits. I always related it to sinus problems or allergies, but I’m not having issues with any of that right now and the issue is worsening. It happens like 2 to 3 times a day now. I seriously don’t know if this just random panic attacks hitting, or a heart or lung issue?? I’m convinced I’m dying but I can’t afford to go to the dr right now, let alone an emergency dr. I feel like it can’t be panic attacks if it happens when I’m in a perfectly good mood. Sometimes I’ll be sitting at my computer at work... sometimes I’ll be putting my son to bed... it’s just random. But the feeling is making my anxiety 100 times worse and for the whole month of January I’ve basically had crippling anxiety from it. Not even in the food to function anymore. I’m over it.

healthanxiety,maugliere91,2019/01/29,"Rewilding Helped Me Beat Health Anxiety Hey guys, my personal experience with health anxiety came from seemingly nowhere. One day I had chest pain, and then every day for months after that I dug myself deep into this dark chasm that is health anxiety. At my lowest, I was up till 4 am on WedMD every night, almost got fired from my job, and most importantly - living in chronic PHYSICAL pain.   


The TLDR of my story is that rather than seeking ""comfort"" (hot baths, heating pads, painkillers), I began to seek ""discomfort"" and that led me to what I now understand as ""rewilding"".   


Basically, you are reaffirming your body how strong and capable you really are, by exposing yourself to elements that we humans previously had to deal with constantly....long before the days of anxiety lol.   


Take some cold showers. Go out into the elements for at least 20 minutes a day. Develop a deeper relationship with your breath.   


If anyone is interested in more information on this, I'll happily write an article, but I'm not an expert, just a practitioner. The man responsible for the term is [Daniel Vitalis](http://www.danielvitalis.com/rewild-yourself-podcast/).   


But there are others doing similar stuff, such as Wim Hof.   


Reaffirming to myself that I am strong was the only thing that pulled me out, and it started with seeking discomfort, learning some stoicism, and severing the emotional attachment I had to my physical symptoms. You can do it too.

healthanxiety,thatotterisrabid,2019/01/29,"Dry Skin This might be better suited for r/anxiety in general, but since my anxiety seems to be health anxiety I figured I'd start here.  As a background, I've never had an anxiety/stress issue prior to September, but Labor Day weekend I had what I now know was a panic attack that sent me to the ER.  Since then I've been convinced of heart disease, brain tumor, diabetes and have been under constant stress the entire time with every single thought it seems being dedicated to why I feel the way I do.  MRI, ultrasounds, EKG, stress test, blood work all comes back clean and my doctor just tells me it's stress/anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

The last few weeks I have had ridiculously dry skin which I have never had before.  I saw my doctor last week and again he said it's just stress and none of my tests have been out of the ordinary to suggest otherwise.  He started me on Celexa (this week has been a roller coaster of suck, but I'm hopeful) for anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone dealt with chronic dry skin as a result of anxiety?  If so, what was your best way to help?  I know clearing stress/anxiety, meditating, etc., but I'm thinking more of the immediate while I work on ""me"".  It's hard to break the anxiety cycle when every time I touch something or move my skin hurts.",6.506040816326532,6.459887338775508,6.8398979591836735,77.19331632653063,65.40816326530611,10.102040816326527,32.193877551020414,9.784248007369934,2.9481836734693867,998,36,188,19,14,324,140,245,0.175,0.741,0.084,-0.9683,0,0,1,0,0,0,42.0,0,1,0,4,8,12,3,4,12,0,21,13,7,1,4,32,38,16,0,2,8,0,7,0,0,1,6,1,1,0,10,8,0,0,8,2,0,3,3,8,1,0,14,9,21,4,24,20,7,32,0,1,1,0,8,5,1,6,21,117,31,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17178311899701962,0.19264916720692565,0.0,0.0,0.4851450540452694,0.0,0.0,0.05542907119299503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09018374371578486,0.0,0.060955544948546415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06745493225964548,0.0,0.08319144195901391,0.07010995271298028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08849416097555551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06828611137902031,0.0,0.08566524972120057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05112410854133472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16227722119627674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840962638335849,0.0,0.0,0.1335807498934998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040082482677742184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07101245607543885,0.0,0.0,0.08426280247452421,0.0,0.09393811795514567,0.05313458607741288,0.0,0.0,0.07873533155403542,0.0,0.0,0.08486269160119977,0.0,0.0,0.08273973913891197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08713202223116061,0.12923509327539906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08409543740842182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08425396398105646,0.0,0.0,0.12227944859407693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09300902405162367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07540615925856715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443331426985638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311498163229531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061027728916473414,0.0,0.0,0.1122187565052634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5448372633872984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06928752909409545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05079452182667789,0.0,0.06293339211334849,0.09244869105220704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12584540525285196,0.1907624957008172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07153096700993174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11542243173039755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19264916720692565,0.0

I had one today because my foot was tingling for the past three weeks (non diabetic related did blood test previously and all came back normal) and my dr saw nothing severely wrong that needed er attention with my foot and then my mom thought oh it’s probably my Valium that I’m on for anxiety causing the tingling cutting down. I still felt like I needed to get checked for this so I went dr had ordered a lumbar spine mri and come to find out they did the quick results where they tell em what was wrong until my dr calls or I go in to go over the results more in detail and of course I have a bulging disc in my back as well as arthritis 🙄😕😠

If you’ve had one done what reason did you have the test for and did they actually diagnose you with what you thought you had or was it something different you weren’t expecting or did they just say it was probably just anxiety and nothing was actually wrong?",2.902058823529412,4.618891754901963,4.0713725490196095,87.24617647058822,75.07843137254902,7.741176470588236,27.196078431372552,8.4952907291091,1.8321843137254896,794,31,168,15,17,259,111,204,0.086,0.879,0.035,-0.8618,2,0,1,0,0,0,5.0,0,7,5,0,9,7,1,0,8,0,23,13,4,4,1,34,36,17,0,5,6,1,1,1,0,0,9,1,0,0,13,13,0,0,7,0,1,5,1,5,2,3,25,3,25,2,22,11,2,23,0,0,1,0,17,8,0,4,10,118,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.2360269262512773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850272982138997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951780775617283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.185980497155526,0.0,0.07371982169277876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234864279496374,0.13831548659758214,0.0,0.12423181925200245,0.0,0.10417333610755183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227447613251308,0.0,0.12634956682908913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12375676055748035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161149399225826,0.0,0.22106170403641867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06318266174755231,0.0,0.1374583709422565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05908190538957469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416356279531519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17934103010615635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184889646219448,0.23207753996630856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16389507766589334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154445257460661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2607731185865198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12433958136058212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09617101990520888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13662021499810112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310036825804027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657749545855177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057010409674398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19201507529469344,0.0,0.0,0.11463063499892205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970054045644098,0.0,0.1087335668060309,0.11210638748419274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5288863485955874,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Themusicalvoid,2019/01/30,"Either I'm a hypochondriac or I'm on my way to being a statistic- unbiased advice needed Content warning for some gross-er medical stuff i guess

&amp;#x200B;

So, i'm here because i can't honestly tell if the situation im in is entirely in my head. Short background, in august 2018 .i had some fatigue, joint pain, intestinal issues and i had missed my period 2 months straight so i went to the dr and after bloodwork they determined i had hyperthyroidism and a positive ANA. They also found my sed rate to be elevated slightly and my CRP was around 7. 5 months of doctors visits, a loose diagnosis of thyroiditis (after my levels went from hyper to hypo), and then normalized blood work (back in normal range for thyroid and ANA). I basically get a clean bill of health, all my bloodwork looks good. Except my symptoms worsened. My anxiety and depression also got worse which is why im wondering if im just manifesting symptoms because of my mental health

&amp;#x200B;

The symptoms i had that were strongly associated with thyroid have mostly gone away except for the fatigue, but now new stuff is popping up. For the past month i've been having period problems, abdominal pain and gastro problems. 

I had a normal period in the last week of december, but then 2 weeks later i had 6 days straight of weird heavy spotting. throughout this time (technically since august actually) i was having diarrhea every morning without fail, and intermittent constipation. it came with abdominal cramping and severe nausea that goes away after i use the bathroom. I also completely lost my appetite and was having really strong nausea almost daily. I had stretches of days where i just couldn't bring myself to eat despite being super hungry, it just made my stomach turn. Despite eating less than i usually do, /and/ the fact that i usually lose weight really fast when restricting calories, I've been gaining weight and my stomach has grown so big i can barely fit into my pants. Shortness of breath has become a weird problem too. idk if its related. ive always been bad at breathing but i get winded getting off the bed to use the bathroom. laying down on my back makes me feel like i cant breath too.

Yesterday i went to the ER because since about 1/12 i've been getting really intense sharp/twisting pain in my lower left and lower right abdomen as well as a general dull ache right above my groin. The stabbing comes and goes, sometimes there will be 1-2 min stretches where it is extremely painful/waves of stabbing pain but then i wont feel it for another few hours. I recently looked down and realized the left side of my stomach is bulging out a little farther than the right side. Its hard to tell, as i have a softer stomach anyway. I was supposed to get my period on 1/25 i believe, but instead i had spotting the whole week and then on 1/28 during one of my classes i got horrific lower back pain and strong cramps. I had severe nausea and the pain was so bad i nearly cried. And yet, still only occasional light spotting. This is highly unusual for me as i usually have very light and painless periods with only moderate cramping *exactly* when i start bleeding. I took tons of painkillers and fell asleep but woke up in just as much pain and still hadnt started bleeding. So i went to the ER the next morning

They did an internal ultrasound, bloodwork and a urine test. The blood and urine came back mostly fine. They confirmed that my thyroid levels were normal, and my liver and kidneys are in good order. Lymphocytes are a bit low, globulin a bit high, and in the urine test they picked up some protein and blood but they assumed that was from traces of the spotting i was experiencing. The ultrasound found that my ovaries and uterus look ""unremarkable"". There were ""small follicles"" present, as well as evidence that a cyst may have ruptured on the right ovary and there was a small amount of free floating fluid. Shortly before i left, i started bleeding normally as well. I was surprised honestly. Looking down and seeing how bloated i am and feeling the immense pain on my left all the time, i really expected them to find something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in immense pain and i'm confused. This all set off alarm bells in my head. i tried to brush it off for a long time but the pain just got worse and worse. I'm gonna obviously wait out my period and see if the pain persists after. I have a CT scan scheduled (ordered by the dr on my campus, i had gone to her about the pain a few weeks before the er thing happened) for feb 9th but it costs $3k for me..

healthanxiety,m44te,2019/01/30,"Can glandular fever cause problems years later? I contracted a bad case of glandular fever when I was 14, and was in hospital for a couple of months, on an IV, and even had to use a wheelchair as I lost so much weight. It took me four months to go back to school full time due to being so exhausted all of the time. Before all of that, I was mostly healthy, maybe a bit underweight and had an underactive thyroid, but I was healthy. It was also around this time that I began struggling with manic depression and anxiety, which I am now medicated for.

I’m now 19, and my thyroid has began working normally again but I am constantly ill. I have colds at least once a month, if theres a flu going round I catch it, despite my best efforts to keep up with the preventative measures. I had 7 chest infections last year. 7. I recently was hospitalised for a kidney infection, then haemorrhaging ovarian cysts, and i’ve just been diagnosed with ANOTHER kidney infection just three months after the last one. Everything else (I’m told) by doctors is healthy, I’ve had blood and urinary tests, ultrasounds and countless antibiotics and multivitamins. In addition to these other symptoms I’ve developed psoriasis and my hair is falling out, and I’ve also lost most of my toenails. I’m beginning to get embarrassed about being ill so often, and that people might think I’m making it up.

I can’t help thinking this is all somehow linked to developing glandular fever. I know its possible to have long term ME afterwards, but I was wondering if anyone has a similar story regarding this?? Ive been to countless doctors about the various symptoms but none have gotten any better. Ive gotten so frustrated I have started to keep track of when I’m ill/ what symptoms I have and they’ve began to link together... In my mind my immune system has been seriously compromised since that time and I can’t think of any other reason why.

healthanxiety,Tomoshaamoosh,2019/01/30,"The third appointment in a row where I have not been examined So I am well known to my gp practice recently due to a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. Long story short I wasn't fit to work and was very much suffering on the antidepressant that I had been put on. I was suicidal and close to the edge, having panic attacks on the daily etc. I have since come off the antidepressant and it has been thw best decision I have ever made for myself. The anxiety is still there (and always has been and I suspect always will be) but I am functional again - I couldn't even open my work email or answer an unexpected knock on the door without risking a panic attack and now I'm back at work.

In the last month I have been experiencing intermittent, stabbing, shooting pains. I have a history of chronic muscle tightness and pain. I am currently in physio for trapezius and neck pain, I also have mid-back tightness. I have previously had my legs in casts and afterwards splints to manipulate my calves into the correct position. I know what a muscle cramp feels like. I know what a pulled muscle feels like. I know what a muscle spasm feels like. I know what DOMs feels like. This new pain is on another level and it is vastly different in nature. I can't sleep, I can't lie comfortably, I can't concentrate properly, I will involuntarily have to change position and grab the effected limb when the pain comes on.
The pains that I am experiencing are not in the usual suspects of my calves or back/neck but in my groin/armpit/side/back of my thigh and glute area/ankle/elbow. My Google history is looking pretty crazy as a result. 

I have seen three different doctors at my gp practice about this because I am extremely distressed. Not one of them has examined me. All that has happened is that I have been counselled about psychosomatic symptoms being a thing and encouraged to get back on antidepressants. I feel like nobody is taking me seriously and this being the UK GPs are very much the gatekeepers to other services. While I would be willing to pay for answers if it comes to it I wouldn't even know where to start because I have no idea what could be causing all this. I'm crying as I'm typing right now from a stabbing pain in my groin. I just cannot believe that it's all in my head when my mental health is so much better now than it was.

healthanxiety,CocoNadine,2019/01/30,"I cut shallots yesterday afternoon, and one of my eyes STILL burns. Now what? This is going to sound dumb, but I'm really not sure what to do.

I have flushed my eye with water multiple times, and blotted it with a cool, damp paper towel.
The area under my top eyelid still burns, and it's been 18 hours since I cut the shallot. I did not touch my eye directly at any point.

Am I in danger over this? Do I need to get to an eye doctor today? Or is there something else I can try? I have allergy relief eye drops, but I'm afraid it will make my eye burn more.

healthanxiety,euchisin,2019/01/30,"12hr plane journey tomorrow, any advice? Hi guys, 

First post here, I'll be stuck on a plane for at least 12hrs tomorrow and i'm nervous just thinking about it.

Occasionally when my anxiety peaks my whole body will experience numbness and pins and needles spreading across my entire body which freaks me the fk out as i feel like i have no control over my body -head to toe, and am going to spasm. 

The worse thing is sometimes it happens ""randomly"" when i don't necessarily think i'm anxious. One moment i'm completely fine, the next i'm trying to fight myself. 

it's been a couple of years since i've been on such a long flight and i'm not particularly looking forward to it. Any advice to would be appreciated

healthanxiety,pnwander27,2019/01/31,"Health anxiety is the worst Health anxiety can be so incredibly difficult. I've struggled with health-related anxiety, alongside other anxiety struggles, my entire life. It seems as though when one 'health worry' disappears (could take days, weeks, months) a new one appears. It's absolutely exhausting and takes over my mind for the entire day. Has anyone found improvement from therapy, and if so did you seek a certain type of therapy? I'm going back on my medication (antidepressants) after coming off of them a few years ago. This past month has been almost unbearable, and things have been bad since the summer after suffering a skin cancer scare. Any tips for coping? Today has been really rough.

healthanxiety,Will_Sn0w,2019/01/31,"I somatized fever. One thing I never thought I could have is a ""fake fever"". Fever is your body fighting with different harmful organisms, so it's doing good by doing bad. All fevers must be real, right? Maybe.

I was so afraid of Dengue Fever after a mosquito bite I had that it was driving me insane. I was literally counting days and hours until the certain first symptoms. I had it once, and fever it spikes out of nowhere up to 40º degrees, for days, basically destroying you. 

So, in the past week I was just waiting for fever come. It was an evening, and I started to feel my legs, arms and face really hot and weak. Panic attacks followed and I was constantly taking my temperature. It went from 36,4º, 37,3º, 37,5º but never above. I kept having this for 5 days in a row, until it finally stopped after going to the ER. If I payed attention to something else, it'd cease for a while.

healthanxiety,rhubarbcustardcola,2019/01/31,"Numbness sensation on chest around heart after waking up once in a while - please... does anyone else experience this? So this is seriously at risk of ruining my day after doing so well for so long, so I'll try keep it brief.

I read an article about snoring and sleep apnoea last night - according to everyone who's ever slept in a room with me, I do snore heavily, but don't have sleep apnoea.

But this article I read said that even snoring is bad for you, and I got freaked out. I wake up sometimes with dead or asleep arms, making me think there's something seriously wrong with my heart and circulation, though my fiance convinced me this is just cause I move my arms to weird positions and the circulation gets cut off temporarily.

But something my fiance can't talk me down from is the fact that sometimes I wake up with red indents/marks all over my body, along with like a numbness or asleep feeling around my lower chest on the left side, stretching around to my side. 

The thing is I can only ever remember this happening on the left side - I.e. where the heart is, but I'm always very groggy when this happens so maybe it does happen on the right and I don't take notice? I only bring it up because it happened recently. The sensation goes away within 10 minutes or so.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? It only ever happens when I am in very deep sleep, having very vivid dreams and then wake up suddenly.

healthanxiety,Evrir,2019/01/31,"Fear of Brain Aneurysm presenting as Headaches and Pulsatile Tinnitus So for the last five years or so i (26m) have had some various symptoms that i am not sure are simply me being aware of them or something much greater. In particular I experience Pulsatile Tinnitus, where i can clearly hear my heartbeat thumping in my left ear much greater than my right. Exertion makes it much more noticeable. Occasionally I also experience mild to moderate headaches that seem to follow a distinct line from the back of my skull to right behind my left eye. Some mornings, if i sleep on my left side, I will wake up with a headache on the left side of my head that throbs in time with my heart, and laughing/sneezing/straining can create a very -weird- sensation in that same area behind my left eye. I don't know if i could describe it but to my HA-addled brain it seems like what you'd feel if you had a ballooned vein suddenly swell slightly.

I also have been experiencing a slight visual disturbance in the left eye where lights and bright objects have a small, shimmery 'smear' above or below them, hardly noticeable unless I'm looking for it but still strange. I know symptomatic unruptured aneurysms can cause double vision but this seems to minor that I couldn't trust whether or not this is what 'double vision' entails. I have 20/20 vision, don't smoke, drink, or do drugs, no family history of aneurysms to my knowledge (my grandmother did die of a stroke; she was 86 though). I did have a MRI done when i first encountered these symptoms about 5 years ago and they found nothing; the visual disturbance was there during that time but I'm unaware if the pulsatile tinnitus was.

I've had a long, bloody history with Health Anxiety and I'm reaching out to you guys to finally admit that i've got a worrying problem. Can anyone shed light on if my fears are justified?",7.103300492610835,7.690357540229889,6.538374384236453,77.70120689655175,64.11494252873563,9.961904761904762,35.249589490968795,9.842372674337009,3.3937313628899837,1496,65,270,29,21,462,194,348,0.129,0.789,0.08199999999999999,-0.9622,0,0,4,0,0,0,35.0,0,3,3,1,12,10,0,4,16,0,31,20,12,2,3,47,47,28,1,8,18,0,3,1,0,1,7,2,0,1,16,9,1,0,9,1,0,1,6,6,0,2,12,13,36,4,37,30,12,40,0,0,5,0,10,25,0,15,15,183,52,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0814311998575945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14692596414785114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07027511016534546,0.0,0.0,0.06423289780193499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07063714409914283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2050994640779476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09436882955382099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07334530442378599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095339516729857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400796602271168,0.0,0.08999098073767814,0.1065321679899504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17971970832769416,0.08660046611130444,0.20674331900730394,0.04644880309328756,0.0,0.0,0.1006316648455788,0.0,0.07813880612013553,0.0,0.10072327675505158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347140712784289,0.0,0.0,0.09095902832232927,0.0,0.0,0.08229139936110838,0.0,0.0942781639870596,0.09764630478842948,0.10353652285974532,0.1088583553801554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097124412861114,0.07488078331566306,0.0,0.0,0.5988579294736011,0.0,0.0,0.044879728019710886,0.0,0.0,0.08129605697342908,0.0771419665973509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06131941120150437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20259010496930768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881452350300249,0.20917376462856285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08790069302232237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569013721137178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508864699926791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09192956030291352,0.0,0.0,0.07072079308215844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07336208438818376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865799956064578,0.19096211415435504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902551450593783,0.0,0.10713236207049301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07579677536761949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09329155680804352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11831380080012392

8 months ago I had a viral infection which has since caused whatever chronic condition or disease I have.

\-Just want to add, my viral infection started with a bad stomach/lower abdomen ache 1-2 days before the actual infection (8 months ago), and I had a rapid heart-rate from right at the start of the viral infection.

My symptoms are:

\-Just want to start off by saying my heart-rate was high right from the very start of whatever infection i got, like from day 1.

\-Tachycardia through-out the day. Little things make my heart race (whereas before I was very fit), I wear a fit-bit and my heart-rate is very normal in the 60s when I am sleeping. But in the day time, when I am out, even if I am just seating my heart-rate is constantly around 110 BPM. And if I have anxiety it can easily go up to 140. And if I, for example, climb the stairs or jump around a bit, my heart-rate shoots up to 150, and if I go for a short jog (I can't because of my heart), but in 1 minute it is nearly 180 BPM. Due to how fast it beats I do not take part in any exercise. I had normal Echocardiogram, and EKG.. but I did that 5 months ago. I want to point out, for some reason when I am with my family at home my heart-rate is also normal if I am just seating. And it was also normal when I visited my cousins and when I was in their house, again just sitting.

Recently I had to attend a science lab for my university, and even though I was sitting my heart-rate was consistently around 110-125.

\-My systolic blood pressure has been evaluated since this chronic condition.. at 130-140, but my diastolic pressure has remained 80.

\-Lately, my chest feels more pressure and stress, and I think its because I put alot of strain on my heart throughout the duration of this whole thing. I visited a cardiologist 5 months ago and he said my heart everything was good.

\-For the past few days, it feels if I breath in very deeply my heart hurts, but not really sure where the pain is coming from

\-My only blood abnormality is a very high B12 at more than double the upper limit, 1476 pmol/L. I have measured homocysteine just now, and it was in the normal range at 9 umol/L. Not really sure why my B12 is very high, as I am not taking supplements and am a vegetarian.

My hands (for nearly 8 months) have blue veins appearing on the finger. very similar to the hand in this photo (but on the finger as-well): [https://imgur.com/a/n5V1XjC](https://imgur.com/a/n5V1XjC) .

\- I had muscle twitching and tingling which happened alot through-out the day, it has since gone down, but the tingling and twitching still happen at times. I had a normal EMG.

\- Leg muscles have gotten much weaker according to my wall-sit time and squatting. Prior to 8 months I could easily do a wall sit for 3 minutes, now after 20 seconds my legs feel unbearably sore, and they are shaking like crazy right away when I start a wall sit.

NORMAL TESTS AND RESULTS (all this are from several months ago, except the blood results posted above, those are from today. ): Normal: TSH, Blood CBC, LDH, ESR, CRP, PROTEIN ELECTROPHORESIS, abdomen ultrasound , Echocardiogram, EMG test, urine analysis, EBV, bicarbonate, chloride, creatinine , AST/ ALT, Potassium.

ABNORMAL RESULTS: Very high Blood B12: 1475 pmol/L (range is 200-600 pmol/L). Slightly low Iron and Vitamin D. I do NOT take any B12 supps when it was measured high, and I am also a vegetarian.

To summarize: I feel I have some type of post-viral autoimmune disease which causes High B12, Tachycardia, anxiety, and high-normal Neutrophils and monocytes. But I really have no idea what it is, or if it is even an autoimmune disease, etc.

Thank you for taking the time to read and help me out. It is very much appreciated.",1.9841265543521869,4.780771661552349,3.0873676293622165,86.63235910549541,86.44584837545126,6.615683914961894,22.766646610509426,7.841875235110058,1.4895797031688724,4603,167,877,98,144,1472,476,1108,0.07200000000000001,0.882,0.046,-0.9741,3,0,1,1,0,0,494.0,0,1,2,3,29,19,0,6,40,0,69,56,30,9,8,119,101,62,0,22,32,1,9,2,0,0,24,34,1,1,29,40,1,1,8,3,0,15,10,13,0,2,25,44,68,6,74,74,21,136,0,2,1,1,12,55,0,18,62,384,97,8,0.0,0.0,0.0342117071706413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18646166246011456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08410799417629017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04768150228516629,0.0,0.08045818982105991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09362758606213976,0.0,0.0,0.03293829556722196,0.0,0.058544198800461175,0.04274225813948358,0.0,0.05966382437702152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07654886194449267,0.03894171270376415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07202877551353183,0.0,0.030199500764638468,0.0,0.03788541655416574,0.0,0.02799108822420817,0.0,0.0,0.1356576783014627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03588351252276766,0.030679632258004987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0292865942958064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07819823169447376,0.06946675254433024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031508013839136866,0.0,0.03304971335551444,0.0,0.07090583674073314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01831644174078416,0.0,0.05977308109952671,0.029405121466237437,0.028039213348812916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06200363059573931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4985290638564672,0.023498745798645304,0.3704087109501997,0.035166193164551836,0.0,0.0,0.0404524098908499,0.03753048560160198,0.07915279118041596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057154159453098013,0.07909426349978846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034255292451163294,0.03513748664582709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023401594175416325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0353174081123456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3078139791126957,0.0,0.05154356320510376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37784508805669936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02375631667484257,0.026663310625654336,0.07460870850832219,0.0,0.0,0.037964571121415824,0.06693396167983356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033141293203158964,0.0,0.06715205303317097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03524313414614806,0.0,0.0,0.035067647452288665,0.0,0.08983662060008722,0.03604562763063432,0.06923140753115106,0.0,0.0,0.08981843181041001,0.03334833860355367,0.02787965613547125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03960574213578565,0.0,0.08700141723571755,0.0,0.0350834788002737,0.0,0.0,0.02698948452120264,0.0,0.0,0.12407173122207815,0.03736733415386821,0.027997492035161668,0.0,0.0401590040785448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06608380221504626,0.03643885199447338,0.10543749376296456,0.0,0.0,0.03227684371474255,0.0,0.0,0.04658216771005999,0.022463853480101503,0.03444446441245485,0.0,0.08177078060938506,0.0,0.033231036641918434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31819319142552005,0.06203463366344776,0.0,0.0,0.042691394420029824,0.0,0.0,0.03163453664716138,0.03914118388235335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,duemmal,2019/02/01,"Today's health anxiety level: shakily taking temperature with a meat thermometer because I couldn't find a human one Today I'd felt pretty okay honestly. Minus my usual stressed out-ness, a mini depressive episode, and being upset I slept in late, it'd be a pretty solid day!

&amp;#x200B;

That is, until the little voice in my head going ""hey you should google some symptoms, you know, its probably just a cold but just to be sure."" So I looked up the fact I've been experiencing flushing in my face, and decided that ""oh god it might be rosacea, oh god what if its cushings"" before calming down and saying its probably normal. I noticed it wasn't just face flushing, my whole body felt warm, so I must have a fever, right? It makes sense, as I've been fighting off a cold for a while now. but then just to completely fuck up my day, my brain thought of that little key word that can send me spiraling: sepsis. I looked up the symptoms for sepsis for the millionth time in my life. I took my pulse by hand and it was 100, I took it using two different apps and it was always above 90. That was one check off the list. I couldn't check my blood pressure because I couldn't go get the machine without alerting my family to my weird behavior, but I didn't think I felt like I had low blood pressure at the moment, but do I even know what that feels like? What if this is what it feels like? I switched immediately to the next test I could try, my temperature. I know I've felt my skin warm to the touch, but I'm naturally someone who gives off a lot of heat, but the heat on my face and neck felt abnormal but I needed to know *how* abnormal, so I tore up the areas where we keep health stuff that I *could* tear up discretely and found no human thermometers. It then hit me that we have meat thermometers! A quick google search didn't really say if they'd be effective for taking usual under-the-tongue temperatures but I'm sure it would work anyway. I cleaned off a thermometer and stood in the mirror with it under my tongue so I could see the display. The numbers slowly kept creeping upwards and the suspense was throwing me into a panic, that I *must* have sepsis, but how did I get it? Oh gosh it must be the canker sore I noticed on that one part of my gums that have been swollen for a bit, that's it its because I don't brush my teeth after every meal bacteria from my teeth got into my blood and now I have *sepsis* and I'm going to ***die****.* And then the thermometer eventually plateau'd somewhere around 95.4 or so. And now I'm somewhat calmer but I just can't help still feeling *weary*. Writing this all out here though has sorta helped me illustrate to myself how ridiculous it has been, which is much better than I've handled the fear of having sepsis in the past! So wooo to me :)

healthanxiety,Slothfuratu,2019/02/01,"Am i a hypochondriac? I am a 24 year old female, and would like to preface this by saying that I do actually have a few chronic illnesses that have been diagnosed, one of which is an autoimmune deficiency. As well as severe anxiety with frequent panic attacks. 

 That being said, for years now I have been hyper focused on various symptoms my body has displayed that usually end with them disappearing and me forgetting they ever happened.  But with every pain or nausea episode I have, I end up spending hours googling symptoms and what they mean.  For years now I have put in anywhere from 2-8 hours a day on various medical websites. 

This week alone I have convinced myself that I have:
-ibs
-Crohn's
-breast cancer
-kidney failure
-pregnacy
-kidney stones
-patellafemoral syndrome
-worms
-diabetic ketoacidosis
-an impending heart attack

I am tired of being scared all the time. I am aware this isn't normal and I haven't even considered that I was a hypochondriac until today. Could that be the cause of these irrational worries?

healthanxiety,Anxiousone11,2019/02/01,"I have to vent! I am so rattled right now. I hate going to the doctor and going makes me freak out. My heart races, my blood pressure rises and my temp always rises to about a 99.0 which freaks my nervous Ass out. I haven’t had blood work done in nearly two years (when I had leukemia anxiety). I am seriously petrified of what could come up in any blood work that is done. I am worried that I’ll find out I’m anemic because I’m losing blood somewhere (I fall asleep on the couch on occasion and it scares me). A new fear I also have is that I will faint when having blood drawn which has never happened before. Earlier this week I built up the courage to go to my allergist so that I could get an update on my meds, I start to tell him about my recent weight gain (from eating out all of the time and being careless with my diet). And he convinces me that there is something wrong with my thyroid from my Zoloft. I am just so frustrated because I want to rule everything out and make sure I know I am fine to get started on getting this dumb anxiety to go away. But I am scared. He didn’t take my blood today but when I go see my Gyno in two weeks he wants me to. I am so nervous. Ugh help!! Has anyone else dealt with this. 

TL;DR

I am freaked out by the doctor. My allergist wants me to get bloodwork done and just the idea is making me crazy ",2.3352768220206457,3.8747956618705084,3.5131216765717888,91.4034297779168,76.19424460431655,6.273631529558963,22.518611197998126,6.8959733430537185,0.5130974038160776,1046,29,228,10,23,339,146,278,0.16699999999999998,0.7829999999999999,0.049,-0.9789,0,0,1,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,4,14,21,3,6,9,0,28,18,9,3,3,35,53,17,0,5,4,0,1,0,0,1,6,0,1,0,12,17,3,0,3,0,0,9,3,17,0,2,6,2,41,4,38,43,1,42,0,1,1,1,6,18,2,0,15,153,53,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871774507042732,0.09070733449741396,0.0,0.0,0.07413240303159943,0.0,0.16678889909510589,0.0,0.0,0.07622424415178089,0.11169643710870926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024210599556921,0.0,0.0,0.13290631188282026,0.0,0.09276181460624676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09390482492133026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17407560870208605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22315832220368814,0.0,0.3346736516429577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11154725052621044,0.09106615805748576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09797362367816012,0.0,0.0,0.12266964253547605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963567161235397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278186342555816,0.0,0.30977226850009953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09639960807559793,0.0,0.0,0.1076275141326172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12918062460835034,0.07306894333420445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12306211708199667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059910552288180235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219573743551189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2183005561299516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12108858163197166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08407734735376532,0.10528518590190897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10763693171514972,0.0,0.0,0.09309628636577852,0.0,0.0,0.21828154511864464,0.0,0.08686904175770223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392333497274711,0.0,0.0,0.15431956029866606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10274321959000812,0.0,0.0819640154742933,0.0,0.09528194178020796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06356620674501352,0.0,0.1033313332605688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2129792182885752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19289561965362045,0.0,0.17488689279642558,0.13274815202755055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1587251495912122,0.11070773150175124,0.0,0.0,0.1191883206967534,0.0,0.07020063197617514
healthanxiety,maytheschwartzbwitu,2019/02/01,"A possible blood clot? I know that I suffer from Health anxiety and it’s been such a relief knowing this group is here and there are others out there just like me. I have a long story which I don’t feel I have the patience to share, but right now I’ve had this pain in my upper leg and in my inner thigh, it’s not crazy bad but it’s enough to feel almost like a bruise or someone kicked me there except that’s never happened. It sort of comes and goes and lasts for a few days and it hurts a significant amount when I walk, my biggest fear is that it’s a DVT or a blood clot, can anyone advise?

I’m freaking out about it, and don’t know if I should see a doctor??? Has anyone experienced this?

I want out of my skin and mainly out of my head. I cannot believe that my mind would cause such symptoms - if it is that and not something massively creepy and neurological. I'm obsessed with my health, keep imagining a great big tumour pulsating away in my head. The symptoms become worse the more I concentrate on them and I can create pretty much any feeling, depending on what I decide to latch on to and worry about. The last fear was unequal pupils and that's triggered a worry something neurologically wrong. I went to the eye hospital and they scanned my eyes, looking for abnormal discs, pressure etc - nothing was wrong. I also had another perfect blood test.

healthanxiety,SilverPoplar,2019/02/01,"Ex-partier, now healthy but with major HA Wondering if anyone else has dealt with this!

I am now 27. When I was 18 I started a 6-year long party bender. Daily marijuana, pack of cigarettes a day, drinking 5-6 nights a week, MDMA every weekend. It was intense. I was on Zoloft at the time for my anxiety and depression due to a crappy upbringing and social anxiety.

Flash forward to now. Quit pills 4 years ago, quit weed 1.5 years ago, quit cigarettes a month ago and now only drink once or twice a week. HOWEVER. Since getting healthier and stopping substances, my body has freaked out and feels like complete garbage every day. I have constant heart palpitations, tingling and headaches. I've had ECGs, a brain CAT scan, MRI on my chest, lung x-ray, blood pressure monitor and numerous blood tests and literally they can't find anything wrong with me. I am sad because I feel worse now than I ever did during my party days, and according to doctors I am in great shape considering. Also go to the gym 3-4 days a week. But every day I wake up exhausted, with random pains, not able to focus, random sweating fits, weakness. Panic attacks at least once a week (in the ER 2+ times a month). Anyone else who used to be a crazy party animal have these issues after getting sober??

healthanxiety,yamarobotron-DX7,2019/02/02,"would my may2018 ECG of picked this up? worried! so; yesterday I was drilling some wood and I out of nowhere felt a dul pain in my left arm and  chest, I think it was brought on by putting arm in or moving it in specific positions, and when I  took a breath, my left side of chest hurt! it went on like for a few seconds and the simptoms subsided  but sometimes if I take a deep breath or lay in some positions it hurts the arm or chest but if I  am just sitting still on my computer it doesn't hurt I read about silent hart attacks and this  caused me to have my anxiety spiral out of controle again! If there was anything wrong in my heart,  would it of showed up on my ECG or is it possible that this could be something new? I keep worrying  but I haven't let this whole thing keep me from enjoying my day. I had my ECG in may of 2018 when  my anxiety had spiraled out of controle over some palpitations that were 99.9% attributed  to eating too many of those chocolate easter eggs. What I notice from the new simptoms though, is  that the pains are very intermittent and come and go, like sometimes I will feel some chest pain if  I take a deep breath, sometimes if I raze my arm, or hold it a certen way, etc I was able to get a  good night's sleep but still worrying about the whole possibility of some undetected heart thing or  a potentially dangerous problem.

healthanxiety,amandajosalene,2019/02/02,"Palms of hand acting strange! Photos: https://imgur.com/a/m9nXmwG

While I was in my mirror pinning clothing to be sewn my palm on my left hand started acting funny and I looked at it and it seems to look like it’s swollen a bit. My right hand was doing that for a while + had a very random hyperextending thumb (which I’ve never had but now it bends back far whenever I hold it up). I also noticed the veins in my hands / body in general are extremely noticeable but I wasn’t worried too much about that part as I am a pale person and none of them are varicose veins. I do have (shown in last photo) this pinched/swollen looking vein or tendon (no idea WHAT that is) a little below my index fingers that had shown up over the summer and that was what started health anxiety in my life to begin with. If anyone knows if it looks like something is actually off, I would appreciate any advice. Ofc going to a doctor is always the best bet but I am about to travel for a weekend out of country~I believed for a while that I may have carpal tunnel by the way my palms and some fingers have been acting.

healthanxiety,ariamae,2019/02/02,"Worried about my gallbladder.... I'm 25, 21 BMI, not super active but I've been good about eating whole foods and fiber though I've had a bad sugar habit.  I'm also on an oral contraceptive (tri-lo sprintec) and I cut my calories to 1,000 for a few weeks to lose weight. That, plus my irregular eating habits and tendencies to skip meals, puts me at risk for gallstones--I think.

Last Sunday I noticed I had some really sharp pains on my right side under my ribcage. This isn't totally abnormal, I have had this before, but this time it was much sharper and deeper than normal. It lasted like a minute or so and happened a few more times but it wasn't anything serious--just left me feeling a little chilly. But for whatever reason, my brain was immediately thinking ""that's gallbladder pains"" and I got worked up. For the rest of the week, I've been panicking every time i've had a pain or sensation in the area--which has been fairly often, making me wonder if it's psychosomatic or if something is actually wrong. I've had some pangs radiate into my shoulder and my arm as well, convincing me even more it's my gallbladder and not me panicking. TMI but I also had some considerable gas and bloating throughout the week, and I woke up more nauseous than normal most morning and I've had indigestion and stomach pains a bit after eating as well. I stopped eating stuff with a lot of fat and sugar in hopes that I wouldn't have an attack worse than what I experienced Sunday--in fact I cut out fat almost completely, I've been too afraid to eat it.

I went for a checkup on Thursday and my doctor ordered bloodtests and an ultrasound on my upper right quadrant. I haven't gotten the results yet, but I got a call from someone at the clinic a day after about information that ""my doctor wanted to share with me,"" but it went to voicemail and when I called back immediately after they never answered--just to add to my worry!

And now to add even more to my worry, my urine is darker than normal, which is another sign of gallbladder dysfunction I've read about...(though I did have beets for lunch)...

I've been panicking about this for an entire week, and I know it's nothing to really be stressed over...I've changed my diet as much as I could and I'm getting everything taken care of, but I'm terrified of having another attack or something awry happening in between now and my blood results/ultrasound. And I'm scared for many reasons of having my gallbladder out...I've never had major surgery and I've heard about chronic digestive issues people have after they get it removed...thought that definitely sounds better than having an infected gallbladder explode inside of you.

Just wanted to vent...I've had to keep myself off of the internet because I kept psyching myself out more and more (and I think it may have ended up giving me more symptoms). I've been so doom and gloom over this and I normally can convince myself to relax even when I'm worried about something being wrong with me, but this time I haven't been.

healthanxiety,MedicalThrowAway1209,2019/02/02,"Really scared this is the start of something I've been having sinus issues for the last few weeks and its been driving me crazy with repeated hospital visits and I don't know what to do.

This January I got a middle ear infection from a flu or cold and after antibiotic treatment it went away and now I'm having pressure on my other ear that feels just the same and I'm worried its another ear infection. I've been googling non stop and I don't know what to do. I've been googling people who lost their hearing and are completely depressed and HIV related to sinus issues because I still have a runny nose all the time and maybe I'm undiagnosed for it. I'm worried that what if my immune system is failing because i have HIV, or cancer. Is this called stress... I don't know what is normal because I've been on edge for years now and I'm scared.

I don't know what to do. I go normal for a few days then in a state of panic for another month. Is this HIV should I be worried? What if its another ear infection I don't want to go deaf and be depressed for it !

healthanxiety,lolakittytron13,2019/02/02,"I think my ex might have given me something... I (22F) have been feeling really off lately. When I wake up I have a headache and I feel dizzy when I bend over. It also hurts to  swallow, which just went away today. I noticed today when I woke up I didn't have a headache nor was I dizzy, but right after I ate breakfast the dizziness and headache came back. Along with all of this, I also have very mild aches in my arms and hands from time to time. This has been happening since the 27th, so seven days overall. It has not been getting worse, but I notice my headaches get worse when I eat the breakfast food at my dining hall. (I'm a college student that lives on campus) I don't think its a cold because I'm not coughing or sneezing and I don't have a fever. I took a STI test yesterday just to rule out any possibility of me having anything and the results are coming back Monday, Tuesday at the latest. I had a boyfriend of 4 months who said he was clean but we still mostly used condoms. The first month we were dating the condom broke during sex and his semen got inside of me. This is what is making me freak out I have something and why I got tested.

I’ve either become more aware of my hypochondria or I’ve just gotten more anxious about my health, which isn’t great either way.
However, I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this sort of thing, so it’d really be nice to have someone to share my worries with and vice versa. Mind you, my last post was a fail because I got ghosted, so if you’re prone to ghosting please don’t message me. 
On that note, message me or comment if you’re actually interested!",3.882954545454545,5.684063292929295,4.731199494949497,83.18346590909094,72.63636363636363,6.970202020202023,28.536616161616163,7.6454224807358475,1.7902616161616165,402,16,75,5,8,130,68,99,0.084,0.773,0.14300000000000002,0.725,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,0,1,5,5,0,0,2,0,9,1,0,0,0,11,11,7,2,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,3,0,9,4,11,6,4,4,0,1,0,0,6,1,0,5,1,48,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.2423911536748955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2806080819223716,0.0,0.17367887705301152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15141520429577282,0.27432536622743153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1986588169323411,0.27384898138626595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2640251513535116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024696192162525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25080137888814424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726557675256221,0.0,0.0,0.23788733378842025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3182478150081283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21045860342032727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996451094912293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16501815176309506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19715907371508207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.252250379157892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I drank water but it didn't go away. It's been a week and I still have a dry mouth and my anxiety has been all over the place about it.

I go to the doctor in two weeks for my annual, so I know that will give me some answers. I'm wondering if its diabetes but my fasting glucose from last year was 82, but I'm not sure.

healthanxiety,softmajo,2019/02/03,"I'm so scared because of chest pain :( I'm a 20 y/o female who's always had a high resting heart rate (80-115). I am currently on my period so it is possible it could be related to it but I'm not sure. I had a baby over a year ago and still have some milk, so I thought this might have something to do with the chest pain. I have a history of acid reflux, but I haven't noticed it in about 9 months. The only heart-related risk factors I know of is just that I'm anemic, vape, and that I'm about 35ish pounds overweight. The last 24-36 hours I've noticed some slight pain on the left side of my chest. It isn't that bad, it just feels like its slightly clenching and it makes me nearly have a panic attack everytime I notice it. I first noticed this happening the other night when I got extremely upset and my heart rate went pretty high. Do you think this is anxiety symptoms, breast pain, or actually heart pain? I'm really scared so any replies are greatly appreciated!",2.74155,4.205046655,4.271000000000001,86.70550000000001,74.95,7.6,25.0,8.278499904357787,1.4453000000000005,761,25,162,13,16,254,118,200,0.234,0.6920000000000001,0.07400000000000001,-0.9874,1,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,1,0,1,10,15,1,5,11,0,18,15,7,1,1,21,32,12,0,1,6,0,1,1,0,1,7,0,0,0,17,5,2,0,4,0,0,1,3,12,0,1,5,2,14,3,14,24,3,21,0,0,0,1,2,9,0,4,12,94,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.09424162458154298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856064168559248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08035673441524514,0.0,0.0,0.06567316584684764,0.0,0.07387832164982562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10986608760024168,0.0,0.0,0.0806346841632466,0.05887019646896365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710593379328362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048830369772476116,0.06899199553937002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214521241296383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07723850215367904,0.10647242073222314,0.0,0.0,0.08539946352502938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4577593730767003,0.0,0.20407001910187128,0.0,0.0,0.09510526207189657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05307416831909231,0.07872014120176309,0.0,0.0,0.1049271893280183,0.0,0.0,0.047180843607299294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06446343767322346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10244902587113568,0.0,0.0,0.07708389867777482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906275140810666,0.0,0.0,0.4397974368898072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07344835782530988,0.5138040804778166,0.11330797728105538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10887190226650237,0.0,0.09824978009857516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06186733849643512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1933734713519594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07434685603994855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712357411578377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09101920649864176,0.10037665155723348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06188028079882661,0.0,0.07666842477393522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08952443054086594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06219004858590236
healthanxiety,candycane573,2019/02/03,Brain zaps/chills I started taking vitamin B12 a few weeks ago and I started getting brain zaps. I know they can be caused when coming off antidepressants but I’ve never been on them in my life. It feels like chills or like fuzziness in my head like static and I hate it.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt them before and I can’t say B12 was the reason why but it all started a few days after taking B12 daily. It’s the worst feeling though and I wish it would go away. Even after stopping B12 they still happen now :( ,0.9824213836478002,3.3151610471698163,2.326698113207545,94.1144496855346,84.75471698113208,4.2880503144654085,17.323899371069178,5.46131890053228,-0.5539157232704395,405,9,85,2,12,130,69,106,0.14300000000000002,0.7120000000000001,0.145,-0.4215,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,4,0,6,5,1,0,4,0,7,5,3,2,3,21,23,9,0,2,3,0,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,0,5,5,0,1,6,0,0,2,3,2,0,0,3,4,13,3,7,18,4,21,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,1,17,54,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15046722119670247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15947944707451167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14443907248599444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3789793897512307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743731588798936,0.0,0.14621884954677505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10947040597357947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11211386923186084,0.15354256087016666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17165465673064034,0.12126466957606148,0.16298021705999804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08868388454500503,0.0,0.09646904673859992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15010346700909707,0.0,0.0,0.16758639728293556,0.17420562854861185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932864955408676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989473458539578,0.2487840523656445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13091652120443573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17452441497027155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13498670980222402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3604356100179951,0.0,0.1355572433955547,0.14191302531143396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552517201736019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876467256352283,0.16677196086437612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13615786136083285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15316695433288258,0.0,0.19519645355045231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205807921616897,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,kittypede,2019/02/03,"How much to say when speaking with your doctor So I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow, which I have probably been putting off for too long (I feel like the more I see her, the less seriously she will take me).  I have symptoms that have lasted months (or in some cases years, only they've gotten worse), ones that have lasted weeks, and one that just started a few days ago.  When I scheduled the appointment, I listed the three most worrisome or annoying symptoms as the reason for going in.  My question is just... when I actually go to my appointment, should I read the dr my laundry list of symptoms, or should I just address what I scheduled the appointment for?  What do you do when you have many different symptoms?  I know that people can have multiple illnesses at once, but the fact that my symptoms are in a few different, probably unrelated areas makes me worry that my dr will just assume that *everything* is in my head (and yes, I'm aware that much of it could be all in my head).  I'm also worried that if I mention that all this feeling ill exacerbates my anxiety and that my anxiety exacerbates my feeling ill that she'll write me off as a nut case.

Tl;dr- I'm experiencing a lot of probably unrelated symptoms.  When I see my doctor, should I tell her ALL the symptoms I'm experiencing (and risk being taken less seriously), or just the most concerning ones?  What do you do?

I apologize if this was hard to read.",6.545096153846152,6.738374010989013,7.316389652014652,72.9978811813187,65.30036630036629,10.927564102564103,34.27861721611721,10.686352973137794,3.691989194139195,1127,47,209,28,16,376,134,273,0.112,0.848,0.04,-0.9576,2,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,0,4,0,0,14,5,1,1,15,1,26,16,2,3,4,40,43,21,0,6,12,0,4,1,0,6,14,2,1,0,19,6,0,0,7,2,0,3,0,4,0,4,4,10,39,1,21,30,14,29,0,0,2,0,15,9,0,12,18,162,58,4,0.0,0.0,0.08852972353234449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041788806698831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0725488250181683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13880124456117687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243261172260762,0.0,0.0,0.05850695443310289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1895663752855437,0.0,0.18571171717125945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08153336927383104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13761241346807493,0.06481045204988307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10311663817346828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08126738343866194,0.0,0.1862099748482446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049857390180416926,0.1478979669114084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044321254637995994,0.0,0.0,0.08028442687090043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712697827325578,0.0,0.0,0.060556366048391375,0.09197593448801078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07241191213585221,0.0,0.13337941242334747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09661393749217913,0.18442284714532836,0.06899671818107503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06289388926042976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934348100846008,0.0,0.0,0.09119874979665717,0.10162726561943816,0.0,0.1814892848460357,0.0,0.0,0.09327536427145433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07214425861706672,0.0,0.0,0.14458433595068582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06421214824787147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6600503838558941,0.06821021913800318,0.0,0.07929335930059228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07277018587351923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842613147320496,0.09245152446523502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05842076505174425

healthanxiety,DarthHaze,2019/02/03,"Had a Panic Attack Last Night. Strange Sensation in Head. Anyone Ever Experienced Something Like it Before? Sorry for making another post so quickly after my last one. But I'm in a bad spot right now and I just need to talk about what I'm going through.


:Last night, I had a weird sensation in the left side of my head, above the ear. It felt like something was throbbing or pulsating inside my head. It was never painful and it would go away for a few minutes before coming back. I felt it until I went to sleep (where I thought something was going to happen to me in the middle of the night or I would die in my sleep.)


It doesn't help that right now, my current paranoia is a brain tumor or a unruptured aneurysm. Earlier this week I had a headache above my left eye around my eyebrow but that went away after a few hours. I've been incredibly anxious about that side of my head.


I woke up this morning and haven't felt it again, though I've been a nervous wreck all day fearing it would return. It hasn't so far, but I think I'm having hypersensitivity in that region cause it feels a bit fuzzy right now.


Has anyone else felt something similar to this?

healthanxiety,pickham,2019/02/03,"Losing sleep over losing sleep I might have a stomach ulcer. Maybe, probably? I went to a doctor who said I might have an ulcer, but didn't do any tests. Two weeks later I went to an urgent care doctor because I had been up 30+ hours with discomfort and nausea. They did a blood test and said I was h. pylori negative, but I'd been on Prilosec for nearly two weeks and apparently that can affect the test outcome. Was told to keep taking the Prilosec. About a week later I went back to urgent care because I was still losing sleep over nausea. On three or four occasions I have woken up in the middle of the night overheated and needing to vomit, almost fainting in the process. I also have pretty consistent abdominal pain across the entirety of my abdomen, which worries me because Google says that I'd feel pain only in the middle. 

I have really bad anxiety and this health crisis has spiraled me into depression as well. I've changed my entire lifestyle in the last month over this--all I eat are carrots, potatoes, apples, peanut butter, and yogurt. All I drink is water. Everything I do I scrutinize and I'm horribly afraid something will happen to my supposed ulcer and I'll bleed out (especially since I'm away at college and hours from my family). Has anyone dealt with and been officially diagnosed with an ulcer? I'm seeing a specialist in two weeks to hopefully be diagnosed, but I'm having a hard time waiting and would like to know if anyone has experienced anything similar.",5.927761753137291,7.119993939501783,6.597111818692639,74.10624648810641,66.90035587188612,9.332159580445776,30.44783667353437,9.549672527348893,2.953956583629893,1191,44,200,24,19,391,163,281,0.173,0.7390000000000001,0.087,-0.9826,1,0,2,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,1,3,5,14,0,2,17,0,28,23,6,1,1,33,50,18,0,4,5,0,2,1,0,4,14,3,0,0,5,16,3,2,2,1,0,3,2,9,1,5,16,8,22,5,35,29,1,37,0,4,1,0,6,20,0,6,15,134,27,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09468048025687914,0.0,0.0,0.07561344802221487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06429881303144104,0.0,0.07233225823035024,0.0,0.0,0.1322263469886207,0.0,0.07780849462349321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08883500757106069,0.0727048899050067,0.07894722926793034,0.17291463143605054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1928047629361309,0.0,0.10002380662710472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08143776592061694,0.19193720836431905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19355659130149527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262526720776447,0.0,0.09675061798143587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08497751932052626,0.0,0.08913550278175894,0.0,0.04780848883665141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361229533210952,0.0,0.08470029765474232,0.0,0.0,0.100504683899864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09391177811801114,0.18622995816976012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08404243740642367,0.0,0.0,0.05196347673427039,0.07707275225233816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046193482568604026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31733954751700144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09499050393349702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20061011753577945,0.0,0.0,0.07547075163660166,0.0,0.0,0.07010933968207841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873093764037726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07191129232736189,0.20122064821713126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619369128131834,0.1019433820588367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06057263083695401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17988179784731015,0.07519179184055284,0.0,0.0,0.07534594921761878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821464778037016,0.0,0.28386178317705124,0.0,0.0,0.07279098752656794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07550959678039185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07109156982326974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05513421224013661,0.0,0.0,0.09034878400709093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2770916031917029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033766386009037,0.0,0.08501388182654694,0.2629528155160352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09602246032590933,0.0,0.06716724807556837,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ayowashka,2019/02/03,"PLEASE reassure me. Do i just have anxiety or heart complications/angina? I truly HATE Google. Anything I look up comes back with ""go to the doctor or you will DIE"". 

SYMPTOMS

Left(just as much chance as the right) side of my chest has pain. It feels kind of internal and dull. It doesn't feel sharp. It comes and goes. 

I've been having these night shivers for two to three months now, where I shake uncontrollably in my legs and my feet start to sweat (sometimes hands not always). I feel better by deep breathing, but not shortness of breath, while going under the blanket to warm up. I also stick my stomach out and hold  an object against my stomach pushing into it. This happens I've noticed, when I smoke medical grade marijuana or have excessive sugar, like a unhealthy big cake slice and ice cream. It's to the point where I know when it will happen because I get a little light headed and don't feel myself and it will happen 3-5 minutes later. 

Recently, these chest pains have been occuring. I feel like I'm going to die. After it's over I just WANT to cry or die even if it's gone. 

I don't really get this from exercise. I can try again but I just ran up four flights of stairs and I feel it, but I don't have to sit down or breathe like I can't breathe. It hurts because I think about it! 

Neck pain sometimes but usually depends how I sleep. Back pain sometimes. Not really arm pain. 

My gf says no worth going to the doctor cause the bills. My dad says it's in my mind. Neither of them can physically feel what I'm feeling. As I'm typing this I'm fine but if I think about it it will come the way I explained (dull just a mild annoyance type of pain)

I'm fucking 23 and healthy. I dance, am vegetarian, sometimes work out and I really don't deserve this. It gets me SO MAD that this has randomly been happening where I'll punch my chest when it hurts just for the fact that I am so pissed off at myself for having this. It's ruining me mentally and I've always had very bad anxiety. I have panic attacks often now as well, around one a day and none if I'm lucky. I used to smoke marijuana a lot and nothing would happen, not even these panic attacks. I have recently started a career job but it's a very stressful one where I deal with public transportation and the crazyb commuters.  

Somebody please I beg to make me feel a little reassured!!!! My dad and his family have diabetes. Last time I went to the clinic three months ago, they said I was fine! No blood tests just the blood pressure arm band was used. Is this angina, anxiety, heart problems??

healthanxiety,aidxn-1872,2019/02/03,"My HIV Health Anxiety Nightmare I participated in a ‘low risk’ activity. It is estimated the chances of acquiring HIV are about 1 in 2,500. Nevertheless, it has happened. 

4.5 weeks later I got the flu. Cue health anxiety meltdown. 

I tested at 5.5 weeks. Negative. 3 other tests later. Negative. I have just ordered my final test at 12 weeks. I know it’s probably unnecessary but I just need to do it to be able to move on. 

Funnily enough, this is happened before. 3 weeks after a risk where my doctor said that HIV transmission “just doesn’t happen this way”, I absolutely freaked. Cue two negative tests and 1.5 years of worry and not fully believing I was HIV negative. 

I know better than anyone the toll this condition can have on you. From the physical symptoms to the stress, the incessant symptom googling, the constant feeling of your lymph nodes or checking your tongue in the mirror or freaking at a bump on your head that’s probably been there since you were born.

healthanxiety,PumpkinFloss,2019/02/03,"[Light] What illnesses have you thought you had throughout your life? I'll start! Leukemia when I was 6 because I heard a family member died from it, bone cancer at 15 cause I had random sharp pains everywhere, appendix burst at 13 when it was actually my ovary hurting extremely due to my first period that was about to come, brain tumor at 18 due to migraines, psoriasis when it was just a skin fungus, ALS at 16 because my muscles were twitching, MS at 19 because of migraines again, mouth tumor at 11 because I had a sore in my mouth and I saw a documentary, lymphoma and sarcoma at 19 because I had a tiny bump in my neck, sarcoma at 20 because of a lump on my crotch that disappeared 4 days later, brain tumor when I was 16 because I almost fainted due to low iron in blood, melanoma at 17 because a tiny dot appeared on my finger (disappeared 1 month later), unknown skin disease at 18 (spoilers! It was stretch marks), at 15 I thought I was going to have a heart attack soon so I went to the cardiologist (it was anxiety because I liked someone omfg. I flashed my boobs at this doctor for nothing), delayed puberty in mid teens because i'm petite, gangrene at 16 because my toe got infected. Wew! I hope i'm not missing any. Thanks to all of that my father rages whenever I tell him I'm going to the doctor. But this time i'm going to one I actually need: a psychologist.

healthanxiety,MonocleComplex,2019/02/04,"Thinking I might have diverticulitis I don't really like trying to diagnose myself, but after living with this unique kind of pain for a few months now I'm trying to stay ""positive"" by considering other causes other than defaulting to my mindset that it's cancer.

I've been experiencing pain on and off in my lower-left abdomen. It ranges anywhere from an ache --  to a burning sensation depending on the day. When it first started happening it got so bad I couldn't sleep on that side. It seems to get worse when the waist-band on any of my pants puts pressure in that area.

I have already been to the doctor for this before and they took an ultrasound to make sure that it wasn't an ovarian cyst, but they found nothing. I also had a CT-Scan done in that region in July of last year when a kidney stone got lodged in my ureter tube, so they didn't find any anomalies in that area either (note, the pain in my left side only started happening around late November).

Eating out too much (greasy foods) or over-eating tends to exacerbate it more. 

I'm planning on making an appointment just as soon as my husband and I are approved for our on-site assistance program, but it might be another couple of weeks until we hear back from them.

I'm currently trying to see if limiting my intake to a healthy amount, drinking lots of water, and exercise helps any.

healthanxiety,championofthelight,2019/02/04,"Weird sensations in head / headaches 28/M/White/320lbs Blood pressure good (118/81) (currently dieting and losing weight steadily, uncontrolled anxiety/depression caused lots of weight gain) Currently taking Zoloft 75mg and Metaprolol 12mg (half a tablet twice a day) as well as magnesium supplements and vitamin b12 supplements.

Been suffering with weird sensations in my head since December 11th. Started off getting very mild headaches with pressure in my right temple. Went to Urgent care, they ordered a CT scan without contrast which all came back normal. I do suffer from high Anxiety and depression which is why I take Zoloft. The headaches have always been mild and the pressure has never really been ""severe"" it just kinda scares me. Doctor put me on metaprolol because he thinks it may be migraines as I also get some auras (black dots and what not). The pain also seems to get worse when I lay on my right side, that's when the pressure is at its highest. My doctor honestly doesn't seem too worried about it and thinks it's migraines but I don't see why migraines would give me the head pressure. I think it's getting better but it is definitely still there. A couple things, I have very outdated glasses and really need a new prescription, I also notice lately that I think I'm a pretty bad jaw clincher without realizing it. I might be forgetting some details, but one other strange thing is I feel like it was less painful and obvious if I wore a hat, but then I wasn't sure if it was caused from hearing a hat (beanie) so I stopped wearing that. Sorry if this is confusing, hopefully someone else has experienced this and may be able to help.",6.2075436484045765,7.977478688741722,5.783503913305236,78.04751354605659,66.74834437086093,9.19951836243227,33.59482239614689,9.573946990214177,3.354802649006623,1332,60,225,28,22,410,182,302,0.155,0.737,0.108,-0.7717,2,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,0,0,1,3,13,25,0,8,13,0,25,19,6,2,4,52,49,27,0,7,11,0,3,1,0,4,10,1,0,0,21,13,3,1,8,0,0,3,7,17,1,3,9,8,22,8,21,33,5,28,0,4,3,0,5,11,0,14,14,142,43,2,0.09568920908718052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295678778063777,0.07962108746325096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07320198303881023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07357909524566346,0.07989649264686198,0.058331253704417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08462932933651597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10944296329956764,0.0975615260158603,0.196598353076583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058782898171204,0.0,0.061711623690474574,0.0,0.16483395114403393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19588392039938904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07993605562121361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048383339253512465,0.06836039009148978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1999746492863725,0.09179380865163186,0.0,0.08025956863855196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2946142045828116,0.0,0.10784869312113736,0.0,0.06413845980917766,0.10110090310274474,0.0,0.09504097559136684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10794159577891484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04674891411134855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10705174861680232,0.0,0.08135154368742185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10151112920117623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07095233606457857,0.07380141710065499,0.09241723441360218,0.0,0.0,0.09375510816263112,0.0,0.10894279876956252,0.0,0.0,0.06484148453366936,0.0,0.2036401301192656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09735032653330054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0961940846695098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12260191520696423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16343612344699282,0.0,0.0,0.0958015914137608,0.0,0.07625191071881843,0.17422372423522747,0.0,0.10810156941802344,0.0,0.07915510258191823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08107715633634767,0.0,0.0,0.10711623538216353,0.06772931470156264,0.0,0.07641752598381275,0.08000046347603443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090185947129394,0.0,0.14389275312910926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1271433172262452,0.2452551256885901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15790723776319573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2330473556903355,0.08603609078140312,0.08870485549297911,0.1726892553936125,0.0,0.0,0.18448196576530546,0.0,0.0,0.09717703669277528,0.0975154790176746,0.067974868678001,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,dishwasher_help,2019/02/04,"Suspected lead contamination of sink and dishwasher. Should I be concerned? I needed to clean my car battery terminals, so I used some of my measuring cups to make a baking soda solution and scrubbed the battery with an old toothbrush. During the process, some of the copper sulfate and probably lead from the terminals made its way into the cups, so I rinsed them out and put them in the dishwasher for a couple cycles. I used a dish that was also in the dishwasher at the time later. 

In hindsight it was an incredibly stupid thing to do, but now I'm wondering if I've contaminated my dishes, sink, and dishwasher with lead particles. I've ordered a lead self test kit, but I've been thinking about replacing my dishwasher and sink because of this. Am I just being paranoid, or should I be concerned?",8.144983221476513,7.905815134228193,8.38381711409396,68.12794043624163,62.087248322147644,12.013758389261744,38.75922818791946,11.45678717892309,4.666079865771811,641,30,109,17,8,211,89,149,0.048,0.927,0.025,-0.4865,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,2,4,6,1,1,0,14,0,10,4,0,8,0,31,18,13,0,4,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,5,10,4,0,3,0,0,6,0,1,0,0,4,0,13,0,18,9,2,18,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,5,4,77,18,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21022628417935935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16025015566174833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29087343999788673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24874488310424045,0.17547547895600435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19492334172225095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27584997003961964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28343077808870226,0.0,0.0,0.26426857067296444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742427937091637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17464682381165764,0.16844388544944885,0.0,0.0,0.15328834848259784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4540905178958561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20866314185496945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850838321090154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It came back because of the stress I’m going through now, at least I think. Is this a normal repose to stress and does this happen to anyone else?

healthanxiety,PingdotBottar06,2019/02/05,"Sudden Death at any Moment This is my first post on Reddit, so I am unfamiliar with things work, however I am here out of desperation.

Over a week ago, I smoked a THC vape pen, (a concentrated form of THC). I hadn't smoked weed in around a year and I generally do not like it. I felt nothing for around 10 minutes, then it all hit at once, and I became very nauseous, dizzy, began to sweat profuseley and breathe heavily, had a panic attack, and had to sit down to avoid passing out. 

I worried I was going to die. I now know that it was a normal reaction to way too much THC, called a greenout, and I recovered from most of the symptoms after a few days. However, while ""greening out"", I felt a strange pressure under the skin of my forehead, and apparently a red spot formed there temporarily.

Most of the symptoms went away. However, multiple times a day, I feel a light pressure in my forehead still, and a few days after that, it spread to feel like it was behind my right eye too. No pain, just a light pressure that gets worse with exercise. I also feel foggy and dizzy, and have ear ringing commonly.

I am here because I have an anxiety disorder, and have had major issues with health anxiety in the past, especially a fear of aneurysms. I forced myself to believe that my symptoms were a result of anxiety, but when they didn't go away, I went to the family doctor yesterday.

I explained things to the doctor, and he wasn't sure what to make of it. He said it was likely a tension headache, but, in his words, ""wanted me to get a CT scan to make sure it's nothing like an aneurysm"", though he highly doubted it.

That made my fears worse. An aneurysm is one of my greatest fears. Worse, I have to live with this fear for another week because they can't get me a CT scan until the 12th. The only thing preventing me from freaking out  totally is the unlikelihood that I would develop one. I'm a generally healthy non smoking 21 year old male with no known family history of this on either side. The symptoms, while they are strange, can seem like those of an aneurysm, but they're too unclear for me to be sure, and could be a number of things.

 I am keeping in mind my past experiences worrying about health anxiety that came to nothing, but it's hard to overcome my fears and symptoms. This past week I have spent in constant anxiety, and now I'm too afraid to even walk up the stairs or drink tea or anything that might raise my blood pressure, because it might rupture an aneurysm. I think constantly about my own death and have trouble sleeping and eating. I know this makes it worse, but I don't know what to do. Ive googled all this heavily (I know, another bad habit) and I can't find any explanations as to what's wrong with me.

healthanxiety,scotste,2019/02/05,"Trying to knock this current bout of anxiety before it gets hold So I picked a spot on my back earlier, gross I know. But then I went and told my wife she could finish it off (she gets a weird kick from it haha) and she said ""that's not a spot babe"". Wow, such simple and meaningless words have sent me into a spiral in the last 30 minutes where I've already diagnosed myself with aggressive skin cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess all I can do is keep an eye on it, chances are it'll heal up and it was just an ingrown hair or something (don't have a hairy back but there are a few patches).

healthanxiety,bearsbeetsme,2019/02/05,"Constant heart anxiety. I’ve been lurking on this sub for about two weeks. It all started one morning after shoveling heaps of snow and ice off of my car for about 40 minutes. I got to work and felt a distinct fluttery feeling in my chest several times over the course of an hour or two. That has subsided, but for the past two weeks I’ve had what I can only describe as a discomfort in my upper left chest that comes and goes. 

I’ve always been the person who googles every single symptom and constantly catastrophizes every situation. So after this incident I’ve monitored every ache and pain, every strange feeling, every random heartbeat that seems too strong or out of place. I am 31f, and I have many symptoms of acid reflux and also a great deal of general anxiety. It also doesn’t help that I work on my feet moving and lifting things all day long so while I get in a healthy step count daily, my arms, shoulders, back, and legs are usually hurting one way or the other.

I am scheduling an appointment with my GP, but I’m hoping to find some reprieve from the constant googling, as well as the fueling of my anxiety caused by any minor, unfamiliar twinge in my body. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

healthanxiety,LPLady15,2019/02/05,"My IUD &amp; HA Hi all, I just wanted to put this story out there if any women are experiencing something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

5 1/2 years ago, I got a non-hormonal IUD put in (Paragard). Shortly after, my anxiety skyrocketed, and my spiral of hospital and doctor visits revolving around my HA started. I wondered if my IUD was triggering it, and I even went to my OB to get it taken out to which she scoffed at me and told me there was NO way my IUD was exacerbating my anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

FF to May of last year, and I get my IUD out. I go on a trip immediately afterwards, and my anxiety is high still because of travel. I get back and BOOM. My anxiety is down to a 2-4/10 verses the 6-9/10 that it had been for almost 6 years.

I'm not saying go get your IUD ripped out, but just a reminder to be your own advocate and trust the way you feel. Just because ""no one"" has had those side effects to a medication/implant doesn't mean it's not happening.",4.24737744121164,4.9945012227979335,6.096373056994818,77.7972419290554,70.45077720207254,9.461777600637703,30.90833001195696,9.661875296680813,2.8365515344758867,748,31,151,17,13,260,117,193,0.056,0.885,0.059,0.5695,0,0,1,0,0,0,43.0,0,3,0,1,9,3,0,0,7,2,13,1,0,2,1,30,30,11,0,3,8,0,1,0,0,1,1,2,0,1,8,13,0,0,4,1,0,8,5,0,0,1,10,4,24,3,22,18,2,32,0,0,0,0,9,12,0,5,10,100,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09446957614673576,0.0,0.1067163827490565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46188251950433,0.3884896399431261,0.07247255953029172,0.0,0.32610890580491364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09487160260436232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194722753602618,0.0,0.1299305055007252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10908087509110573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038974749629102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0538859644512143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22271771665299495,0.0,0.12113455521002073,0.0,0.0852352992760705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09424119614708283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259908378863423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08687033807357701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11608806258536605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07221589052044633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2142684282189969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08475026759341782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08204426999621844,0.0,0.0,0.07543215289855294,0.0,0.08510847229947112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10183403578914586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06285887909915543,0.16918365781692196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09879323675241714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11557270026680524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3884896399431261,0.20588646550910356
healthanxiety,MrAllen16,2019/02/05,"ALS Fear Sending My Life In A Downward Spiral. I don't know where to to turn other then to people who may be able to relate to me. Every second of the day lately I have it in my head that I am going to pass away from ALS shortly. 

It all started about 1 - 2 weeks ago. I started having muscle twitches in my right arm and right thigh, and when I bend over to pick something up or when I squat, my right thigh muscles twitch and tremor uncontrollably. A few google searches later, ""ALS"" is popping up all over the place. It's been a constant worry now with every 5 - 10 minutes me getting up out of my chair to ""test my strength"" in my right leg. But every time I squat or try to balance on my right leg and bend at the knee, the tremors and twitches trigger in my right thigh like crazy. I have really horrible HMO insurance and it takes anywhere from 3-5 weeks for me to see a Primary Care Physician. I have an appointment for 4 weeks from now with my PCP. But until then all I can do is sit back and hope for the best but expect the worst. 

I am in in a massive downward spiral now. I can't do anything but sit on my computer and research ALS. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything because in my head I want life to move as slowly as possible just incase I have not a lot of time left on this earth. I don't know where else to turn. I am so so so scared. (28 year old Male). 

Thank you anyone and everyone who took the time to read this. Idk what writing my thoughts down will do, but I hope I can soak in some positive vibes.",3.240289772727273,3.883770131250003,4.353352272727275,89.75823863636367,72.6875,7.0681818181818175,26.42045454545455,6.980632752743323,1.0041250000000002,1182,38,264,10,22,387,166,320,0.083,0.846,0.071,-0.3799,0,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,0,1,0,2,13,11,0,3,14,0,24,15,9,2,3,39,43,27,0,5,10,0,0,1,0,2,6,0,0,1,11,12,0,0,3,1,0,6,5,4,0,1,3,1,36,7,50,37,8,68,0,0,1,0,6,36,0,8,25,176,47,4,0.1035309622678196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917739513496115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07239125603243304,0.0,0.17039432107346136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09727074708149078,0.07960891939903841,0.0,0.06311151365881304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086493575472965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10555671600897487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11188019016334268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06676890575993223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0864868341718472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616879028932789,0.09892827116881897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11650111587213695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05409065470205029,0.0,0.1176780634575272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125052719402406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20565921176925656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11379581858764272,0.0,0.11678743492940233,0.0,0.1124866934314932,0.0,0.14625396084812967,0.050579998613155805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08801832181785374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11003702835040208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10863832911766848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07177533347265258,0.0,0.1081678201278161,0.0,0.0,0.1167156041440383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10355897921654804,0.0,0.06632458549056565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5304892565589044,0.0,0.0,0.10365255435248352,0.0,0.08250077272858093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07970319281894557,0.0,0.0,0.1465594959282022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0778423990381706,0.0,0.0,0.09531740023275054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08219201951994219,0.1811092100169288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11502670847767772,0.0702907274290014,0.2252239145663502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12213048788059655,0.0,0.2491388791196085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10514071769547198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0666705453045436

healthanxiety,EcstaticSafety,2019/02/05,"I keep losing my ability to sneeze OK, this is a very bizarre one, but I've been suffering from this issue on and off for over two years, and it's having a big impact on my life.  It'd be great if someone is able to shed some light on this.  I keep losing the ability to sneeze.  Basically, I'll get to the ""ahh"", but the ""choo"" won't happen.  I'm not 100% sure, but I think it all started when I had some kind of allergic reaction to something in 2016, and I found myself unable to sneeze for at least three weeks.  During that time, I had quite bad headaches and head pressure.  When I finally sneezed, the pain instantly disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, the problem keeps coming back, along with the head pain/pressure I mentioned earlier.  I think the longest I've gone without sneezing naturally is three months.  Strangely, I can force myself to sneeze by tickling the inside of my nostrils with a pointy tissue, but that doesn't seem to relieve the head pain.  However, I can occasionally sneeze if I think about something erotic and fortunately that does relieve the head pain!

&amp;#x200B;

I've researched this problem countless times and I read somewhere that inability to sneeze could be the sign of a brain tumour, which seems very unlikely because I would also have more serious symptoms, such as an inability to yawn or swallow, which I can do perfectly fine.  Also, the fact that I'm able to FORCE myself to sneeze surely means there's nothing seriously wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

I also read that it could instead be a psychological problem, and I honestly think that could be right - sometimes, when I feel a sneeze coming on, it'll come out fine when I'm having a conversation with somebody, so it could be that it helps to be distracted from the sneeze instead of worrying about it.  I would also like to mention that looking at the light in my bedroom SOMETIMES makes the sneeze come out at the last second, despite the fact that I don't think I have the photic sneeze reflex (i.e. ability to sneeze without fail by looking at a bright light).

Plucking my nose hairs can also make me sneeze, but I tried that a few days ago and it didn't work.  Now I'm ""sneeze-stuck"" again.  Hoping someone can help!

healthanxiety,poubellecharmante,2019/02/05,"Heart ""jumping"" in chest and suspected PVC. Any advice? Hey guys,

For the last few days I've been having a hard time with a weird sensation in my chest. 

Four or five times a day, I'll have a feeling like my heart ""jumped"", or skipped and beat and compensated with one bigger beat to pump out more blood through my arteries. It feels horrible. For a few seconds, I feel like I have no pulse and even though I know it's normal and it's usually harmless it's just a horrible, scary, devastating feeling.  
Does anybody have any advice on how to deal with those things?",3.606747474747476,5.404728927272728,4.08757575757576,87.52580808080809,73.36363636363637,7.7979797979797985,26.767676767676768,8.515128840125781,1.7571919191919183,442,16,91,8,9,139,73,110,0.192,0.721,0.087,-0.9195,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,2,4,4,0,0,7,0,5,5,5,1,0,20,10,9,0,1,3,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,6,9,0,0,6,0,0,2,1,1,0,4,1,5,6,3,12,9,3,13,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,2,8,55,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541727592981763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2464720364145833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23374420284458905,0.18683017178932032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585871056213232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11969429892197797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36652171466093575,0.2589276368456145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17943658826706438,0.0,0.0,0.16233779337168758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.429493855729406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09959393747762317,0.14771873152947307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17707016943218096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17755741714072787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12279956519699975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12039471478309455,0.0,0.1780480244975105,0.0,0.2113420283558812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995885576743347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,uselessthrowaway088,2019/02/05,"Intestinal anxiety I'm a 27 year old male, I don't smoke in any capacity nor do I do any drugs or drink alcoholic drinks in any capacity. I'm not on any medications and have no pre existing illnesses.

Last year I had a pretty large bowel movement, large enough that I couldn't pass it without manipulating my anus with my hand to ease the log out, since then I've been having blood in my stools (on toilet paper and in/on feces), the blood is red, not sure if it's dark red but it's definitely not black. I have no pain associated with passing a stool at all which is slightly comforting I guess...

Shortly after the blood started showing up last year I took myself to the ER and explained what was happening, after getting a finger up my ass I was told it was most likely hemorrhoids. Not to long after visiting the ER the blood in my stool disappeared and I was relieved, now after roughly a year ish later it's shown up again and been off and on for about a month, still no pain associated with having bowel movements, just anxiety.

For the record I have no loss of appetite, no weight loss, and no fatigue out of the ordinary. I have no direct family with a history of colorectal cancer.",4.433250377073907,5.74498973076923,5.914987430869782,77.17151583710408,70.4957264957265,9.266566113624938,28.721970839617896,9.627879704456738,2.6702622423328304,943,35,180,22,17,320,129,234,0.22,0.711,0.069,-0.9893,2,0,5,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,2,5,9,0,0,15,0,19,22,11,1,2,29,28,12,0,2,9,0,4,1,0,0,8,0,0,1,8,13,4,0,1,3,0,7,15,5,2,0,9,7,17,4,32,18,3,41,0,3,3,1,4,15,1,4,20,121,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15724090983998731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40022316041371614,0.0,0.2251133700917325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2882695296251383,0.17062808797432807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15202818309841354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13870432029179572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07687115390354332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16208408101246707,0.0,0.13010962220600694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2398667956213345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718819707258143,0.0,0.0,0.13020847151572834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482214696991764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11744051450852425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15439180323161333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3131207248358437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14968761210897166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171030867241125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041418118303486,0.0,0.1175009616827467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13867153354608544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14059231488912813,0.1634706745390977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.179168901758453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14183139346292534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3789964663707032
healthanxiety,livinglikeLee,2019/02/05,"Bone tumor I had been doing so well for a couple years up until recently. I've got a bony lump growing on my sternum over the last two months, with pain being present for the past 1.5 months. I had an x-ray, blood test, and CT scan. The lump is undoubtably growing and the pain is still there. All the scans and the blood test came back fine, the radiologist just noted a ""sternal notch"" and everything else was fine, there were no suggestions as to what it is or anything. 

My university doctor doesn't seem to know what it is and just said ""you may be producing extra cartilage right now. It might be one of these things where you'll have to wait up to 6-8 months for the pain to go away."" How is the pain supposed to go away if this bony lump is still growing and likely won't disappear without surgery?

I feel better with the radiologist not being suspicious of the lump, but I still feel uncomfortable because no one knows what it is yet and I feel like bone cancer is still kind of in the picture. My sternum/sternal joint pain is still here and it has been 1.5 months. I'm making an appointment with my real doctor back home to try and nail this shit down. I'm 22, about to graduate, and I really don't need bone cancer to kill me right now.",6.667424615384617,5.733192764000004,6.683600000000002,81.39656923076923,65.36,9.932307692307694,30.43076923076923,9.057496981413335,2.169064615384615,981,28,207,14,13,313,139,250,0.18,0.765,0.055,-0.9913,0,0,0,0,0,1,29.0,0,2,0,2,20,14,2,0,17,0,28,19,6,3,2,37,44,17,1,2,7,0,3,2,0,4,13,1,1,0,12,14,0,1,6,0,0,7,7,7,1,3,9,6,13,7,30,27,2,38,0,0,2,0,4,11,1,5,22,139,25,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289578923900387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18928648087306624,0.15491699869979667,0.0,0.06140672649013895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08909134896954585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11521326367614085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114606453855672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20621175716082016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841506258224089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09053354091650556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15280294652719248,0.07196464177469666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11449930825128456,0.0,0.08056646419991934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10104476924489976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114476363475326,0.10489932703111622,0.11072193174623772,0.08211194237461462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09842743298792496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724096271533027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686322941297884,0.0,0.0,0.3216207974026508,0.0,0.0,0.07469324620780571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365204089783554,0.0,0.5359422684456695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09616233808616086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11465774705351035,0.06453300586021155,0.0,0.09946302071638986,0.0,0.0,0.17205317379211607,0.09582143745640223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917047714799578,0.0,0.0,0.10340236556728166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4022329213871965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06692342792359535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06839201318098723,0.0,0.0984028254208194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090572280885064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971043213944797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06486962050375142
healthanxiety,J1mcdonald,2019/02/06,"Does anyone else experience this? Chest pain/aches General info: male, 21 yr old, 150 pounds in weight

So about the last 3 months I've been dealing with extreme anxiety and hypochondria involving fear of something being wrong with the heart and something bad happening in general. Last month I went to the er, did an echocardiogram, ekgs, holter monitor, and had some blood tests done. The doctors said all the results came back within normal ranges. However I've been having chest pains/aches over the duration on the left, middle, and right side and specifically the last few days it's been like an ache on the left side of the chest. I told my cardiologist and he advised treatment for my anxiety first then if symptoms persist I can make another appointment with cardiology. The last few days I haven't had much anxiety but still have had chest aches. Does anyone else experience similar feelings? Any thoughts/opinions would be appreciated.",7.849550930996717,9.370917602409644,7.0713581599123785,71.24302847754656,62.73493975903614,10.855640744797373,35.572836801752466,10.832165505486646,4.173681927710844,766,34,125,20,11,236,113,166,0.091,0.871,0.038,-0.6007,1,0,2,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,2,4,4,0,1,13,0,15,9,6,2,1,22,22,10,0,3,2,0,2,1,0,1,2,2,0,1,2,10,1,0,2,0,0,2,1,3,1,1,12,4,6,1,14,7,5,27,0,0,0,0,7,12,0,2,14,68,8,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827629778494717,0.12761738577281995,0.27930996561912325,0.0,0.0,0.1701967067663382,0.24940051508522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935829591413142,0.10161786009928224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391970957045904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15697818352041265,0.12547160801157414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245693281357443,0.21300819842575552,0.12454557379774132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2033363580278256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380999732621353,0.0,0.13695097545453422,0.061537261981332386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352146584845368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10762255507160144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14421997312679247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3968204193342712,0.0,0.0,0.2644637740295246,0.0,0.0,0.059458487557863565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08123844793308205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19428614157865598,0.0,0.08946653472271086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11924420145666455,0.0,0.0,0.12770800548163475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12950176889818654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10393465706318362,0.11576849205194747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873875614268862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719307077569628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126497184691976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1162935061623794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14820283596002332,0.0,0.11282094240924903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08645511795015558,0.13306435434902025,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,tomasmaru,2019/02/06,"Thes past weeks i have been really worried These past weeks i have thought that i have Multiple sclerosis or Fibromyalgia because i have been feeling similar symptoms to those diseases. I searched up about health anxiety and read that a very common symptom is pins and needles which i am feeling a lot. Every time i hear those two diseases or even read them, i always get butterflies in my stomach. By the way in the past i have also had worries about my health. I have had worries about my shoulder since it was starting to become numb and the joint clicking exactly in the spot that i had fell on a few years back playing soccer. I also had big worries that i had cubital tunnel syndrome since i was feeling numb in my pinky for two weeks. Another thing to note is that my grandma has always had the same problem about how shes always anxious about her health, so i don’t know if it could be inherited behavior or something like that. If anyone was wondering i am thirteen and male.

healthanxiety,sleepswithstars,2019/02/06,"Is my tailbone supposed to feel like this? I'm kind of freaking out.

Recently in the shower, while checking my body for signs of anything off as usual, I felt my tailbone/lower spine and realized it felt totally different than it used to.

I have no pain in my lower back or tailbone, but the actual bone itself feels strikingly different when I press down and feel it. I've felt my tailbone before, and it didn't feel like this.

The best way I can describe it is like, there are several bony lumps on it when I swear it used to just feel like one single bone bump.

Is there a way to accurately tell how tailbones are, well, supposed to feel?",6.4473809523809535,6.12152770634921,6.695079365079366,79.12214285714286,65.58730158730158,10.057142857142855,33.079365079365076,9.606745405546679,2.9032507936507934,505,19,99,9,7,163,76,126,0.065,0.784,0.152,0.9394,5,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,8,9,0,0,4,0,8,6,4,3,1,22,20,10,0,0,3,0,10,4,0,0,2,0,1,0,10,4,0,0,10,0,1,0,2,2,1,1,4,10,10,7,16,16,3,14,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,1,10,67,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.1397281060581506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11782922412865095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11010058489525526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12184006396999485,0.0,0.15026403956684722,0.0,0.0,0.15904648474914415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2991961290975938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4343924534444105,0.3068746187056885,0.4124407557593384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14910535781325746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2798122357820583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09702600105094934,0.0,0.1523591541824405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14137811664612102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1617585264032027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251501809334385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2473320896645379,0.1576982750354282,0.0,0.0,0.2273075031388074,0.0,0.0,0.1287406957846774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Mediocrewatch,2019/02/06,"Health Anxiety? Random abdominal pain, scared of going to the doctor and potentially hearing worst case scenario I’ve had a LOT going on since Christmas. I lost my grandmother to cancer, I’ve been sick, had a panic attack, felt grief out of nowhere for the first time which included pains, random anxiety, and somewhat a fear of my own health. 

I had diverticulitis at the end of October last year and it was the first time I realized “oh wow. I’m not invincible and there are more things than stomach aches”

With all of this going on, I’ve also now started to feel a small pain around my gallbladder. It mainly happens when I’m readjusting my position, sitting uncomfortably, etc. it feels almost swollen and like I’m squishing it (I’m a bigger guy). I’ve read things online for relief hoping it was just gas or it’d go away on its own. It’s definitely gotten better! When it’s not hurting I’d feel a pain in my lower right, or on my left side. All of these pains are a 0-3 max on the pain scale. 

I can’t decide if I’m just looking for something wrong, or if I’m having health anxiety. I’m just so scared to go to the doctor because I don’t think I’ve ever gone and heard good news. It feels like it’s getting better over time, but I wonder if I’m over analyzing every pain or feeling I feel now.

I know I should go to the doctor, but I’m scared of going and hearing I have to have surgery, or if I’d hear (hopefully) “it’s just irritated from a bad diet and lack of exercise. Lay off fatty foods and take 2 of these a day and you’ll be all good”",2.6439570774053536,4.182737332288403,4.546097178683387,84.32216964070413,75.36363636363637,7.415529298287917,24.494936098384372,8.139509932561175,1.3818072341451644,1215,39,253,20,26,415,164,319,0.206,0.7190000000000001,0.076,-0.9884,1,0,1,0,0,0,34.0,0,1,0,5,13,29,1,5,16,0,17,20,1,0,4,56,57,25,1,8,17,0,7,2,0,2,17,4,0,1,18,13,2,0,12,2,0,8,4,19,0,2,11,12,17,10,35,42,12,42,0,3,1,0,6,18,0,17,17,150,35,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0757387106451093,0.0,0.0,0.060486227415576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17358441660474525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06733223777820678,0.0,0.08604707621417566,0.07106268277607104,0.0,0.063153052641201,0.04610711451508233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13378811293260054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04877908016218279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23225051175697606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06699120724021829,0.0,0.08435433644726953,0.0,0.06841725686849383,0.06372674549338364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08511173285575921,0.22946355738088856,0.054034503530743565,0.07262259605338743,0.0,0.0,0.1286721955340184,0.0914595714989441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03951678332460572,0.0,0.30090049685364845,0.12688008184773886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07489171167960232,0.0668848259467078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24119317366317145,0.2557424225391737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502475899942632,0.0,0.0,0.08097009717140873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041567667567939115,0.061653583353448525,0.0,0.0,0.08217893304710132,0.0,0.0,0.07390403598421127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06351534341740614,0.0,0.0825658274372201,0.06430317715750818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5633756127373432,0.08874276284646372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07565665022099571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06459288615547976,0.0,0.0,0.2271750390497909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06256703134980336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058228428150013826,0.0,0.0,0.05353567891403867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056868995821976735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10049863692084547,0.04846461136784405,0.0,0.0,0.1323121979157373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820242129511169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08269629144582284,0.0,0.04870722137576743

healthanxiety,corathaexplora,2019/02/06,"Health Anxiety, what has worked for me - Hopefully it helps you I have health anxiety and it's taken me about 3 years to. It feels good to know that I am not crazy or feel like I am dying from cancer or having a stroke or whatever else it can be. The symptoms are all over the place one month it will be numb limbs, the next month my face feels tingly, the next month I have shortness of breath, then the next month is muscle cramps, the next is heart palpitations. Each time I   I've been to the doctor so many times its kind of silly. Here are some ways I cope with it. I have days where it's gone, mild days, and days where it's an episode. I am glad I found this group because it makes me feel like I am not alone. It's hard to talk with people about your health anxiety because most people don't understand. I think it's fine for people to not understand we all 

1. I see a CBT therapist 
2. I channel my thoughts into something creative (painting, woodworking, reading, writing, drawing etc.) 
3. I keep a journal about the symptoms/day to day occurrences 
4. I listen to classical/calming music before bed 
5. I allow myself to worry for an hour a day
6. In the morning for about 10 minutes, I tell myself I am healthy, people love me, and today will be great, you will be ok. 
7. I laugh/talk about it with my friends (not for everyone but it helps me to know that some people have health anxiety at a mild level)
8. I note all of the things that happened that have made me feel better and then I repeat them, in addition I also write down all of the things that made me feel bad and try to articulate why that make me feel bad.
9. Little to no Caffeine, I love coffee but limit myself to drinking coffee on good days. As coffee can sometimes really amplify my symptoms.  
10. Little to no alcohol, I limit my alcohol intake to social events and never drink on weekdays. I noticed that alcohol while it suppresses my symptoms it makes me into a monster emotionally, so I only drink when I am having a good day and not worried about anything. 
11. Find a hobby. I like to sail, a hobby that requires concentration around the boat and everyone on the boat it helps me be mindful of my surroundings. It's something that has me forget about the symptoms because there is no time. This one took me about a year but I am glad I invested my time into it. 

This list is a work in progress, my recovery has been slow and each month I set a small goal for myself. In the midst of the anxiety it's important to realize that recovery and healing take time it will never happen overnight and I think understanding this and setting very small goals has really helped me. My list above is months of testing out different methods to see what worked for me. Just remind yourself it takes time, you are not alone.

Fast forward I feel like my driver is taking too long, I gave her a call and she sounded nervous and said she’d be picking it up in a minute or so (even though the app said the food had been picked up). 

Eventually, brought my food about 20 min or so after the call. And, now that I’ve eaten it for some reason my mind only thought of anthrax... and how my nervous driver could have poisoned my food... 

So here I am, full and satisfied... awaiting the appearance of any anthrax related symptoms and I guess the ol lights out after that...

healthanxiety,justforthispost12456,2019/02/07,"Mitral valve prolapse, anxiety or something else causing these symptoms? Ok so I've been having some issues with my heart for about 6 years (I'm turning 19 this year) and I've been to the cardiologist 3 times. The first time i went i was told i had mitral valve prolapse and that it was nothing to worry about. The second time i actually went to the er because i was experiencing shortness of breath along with a weird pulse and chest/arm pain. The doctor there said it's just anxiety and nothing else and only told me to get some food supplements. After that my symptoms would come and go and about a year and a half i went to the cardiologist i went the first time again.

 This time she told me i have mitral valve prolapse with leakage to the pulmonary valve and a distention of the aorta in the Valsalva sinus (keep in mind I'm trying to translate my doctor's note in English so I might have made some mistakes). 

Anyway after she finished the echo and the heart ultrasound she told that most of the things i experience are due to MVP and anxiety and that I'm okay but that I should also avoid things like coffee and energy drinks. I'm sure she explained things with more detail but my mind was pretty blank due to the constant anxiety I had these days lol. I still have shortness of breath and some pains in the chest and left arm that come and go along with back pains. I also get heart palpitations and a weird heart rate that is sometimes too fast and other times too slow (I went to have a blood test and an ultrasound for my thyroid a month before since my TSH was higher than normal and they came out ok and was told that I should do the tests again after 6 months).

 I just want to know if i should worry about the other notes my doctor wrote despite my mitral valve prolapse and if these symptoms i experience have anything to do with my aorta or the pulmonic valve leakage or even my high thyroid hormone. Maybe my anxiety makes my symptoms seem so serious and I'm reading into this too much..",5.646505102040816,6.3266435790816375,5.726730612244897,81.93255510204081,67.2908163265306,8.210775510204082,28.690204081632647,8.109356740369918,1.8027164081632647,1601,51,308,19,25,505,170,392,0.067,0.858,0.075,0.7140000000000001,0,1,2,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,1,2,21,13,0,1,26,4,25,24,9,3,1,70,57,35,0,9,9,0,0,1,0,5,13,1,0,0,21,36,2,2,3,2,0,10,0,8,1,4,24,2,38,5,40,28,7,47,0,0,0,0,13,10,0,12,28,208,59,6,0.0,0.0,0.06890785561537442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11293797743738675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2700927930708336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05810827465270045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054296844215244215,0.0,0.043044875513813585,0.0,0.06008624730602401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08076217176755163,0.0,0.07253874292917416,0.0,0.12165325910025837,0.0,0.07630729448318943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04553938053470365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21682541776341915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06917361006317987,0.0,0.0,0.11797577952691488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04663905380418469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13814563329148455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.120126334018129,0.08538521464905321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0737844923415269,0.0,0.08026170342895217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33470578342227825,0.0,0.07460624471478214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07370136269354408,0.0,0.06276385449848207,0.0,0.0,0.03880691938065712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07672095684307825,0.0,0.0,0.034497821674225125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06681548909394258,0.047134557318817,0.0,0.07093999593072013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490896633000715,0.14259749122478788,0.0,0.11272484284823207,0.0,0.05190849426957488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06918550011104926,0.13550967145625092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05370417645796853,0.2254108259446726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07183855001795915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07063185638063743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06716889309394898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0642831933568614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0584115944805042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05436114290480033,0.06983781290833731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056391431422255785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665516789155893,0.29357472744650553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14073591552180065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470491657585269,0.0,0.0,0.337367531721683,0.0,0.047941420456396516,0.07680639239341501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04164922802899281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3272936221733374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14342134555990388,0.0,0.05016126989382395,0.0,0.0,0.13641688291236534
healthanxiety,krittykat,2019/02/07,"Spinning out with health anxiety Hi all,

New post, struggling big time with health anxiety, to the point that it is becoming hard to cope.

I'm 36 years, old, I have two kids, currently nursing a 1 year old. About 4-6 months ago, I started losing weight. Initially I thought nothing of it, I figured it was just being a busy mom!

But fast forward and within that time, I caught just the most random viruses, and badly. I caught a flu that immediately turned to pneumonia. I caught a viral rash from my 4 year old niece. My weight kept dropping.

At this point, I started to become understandably anxious and curious as to what was happening. I had bloodwork during my pneumonia that came back ""normal"" in her eyes. But I noticed today there was elevated platelet count and low lymphocytes. Which are commonly linked to cancer of some sort. Why did I google it?

I'm just spinning out, because I lost my dad recently to a very rare aggressive cancer. Something just doesn't add up. I'm just scared that it is something seriously wrong. I'm getting more bloodwork done to hopefully alleviate my worries now that I am healthy... it could just have been related to the pneumonia, and the weight loss to nursing, anxiety and being a busy mom. But I can't see her until next week, and it is just torturous waiting.  

Any tips on how to cope? Similar experiences?",3.534047619047616,6.136653007936507,4.4959619047619075,80.78237142857145,76.46031746031746,8.00025396825397,29.92126984126984,8.841846274778883,2.824979174603175,1066,50,191,25,25,345,150,252,0.211,0.77,0.019,-0.9921,1,0,2,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,3,12,12,2,2,10,0,19,10,2,1,1,38,39,13,0,3,10,3,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,16,13,3,2,4,0,0,5,2,11,0,1,14,6,21,1,26,22,4,41,0,4,2,0,7,12,0,5,24,118,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09370695291315227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188751130683814,0.0,0.24260724823213284,0.11942401556788855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08128569329192567,0.08826476833820786,0.0644408086579482,0.2335003082061951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12090590565195145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08440210877476764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10817966652777856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10340622682264247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05522994660976927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09348041655354652,0.0,0.09469682748840913,0.0,0.0,0.22473296969599568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049954687033279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11826423762587078,0.11539669622627585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2476162907206665,0.08437798857902466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10209691959857056,0.11242548321583233,0.0,0.10357492085509314,0.10143312886119718,0.12035335440834405,0.3327796169224003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.199863257295608,0.0,0.10124248902286104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043774493915693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10583575063728856,0.0,0.08423845668282362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16276390471759825,0.0,0.0,0.14964642561374816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105127141581698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392320031695706,0.12328256522770857,0.0,0.10020223389970867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149838622333338,0.10326487026405493,0.11004950111982004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08722313895366092,0.0,0.0,0.08479546709123845,0.38618474066359343,0.0,0.0,0.09538827435883372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735525862684064,0.0,0.0,0.1155790369843896,0.0,0.20422440870222489
healthanxiety,warriors7796,2019/02/07,"Strep Throat, I don't know. Good evening,

So, I just got back from the doctor, as I went because I have a bad sore throat. They looked at my throat for what seemed like 5 seconds with just a tongue depressor and told me that nope, everything is fine. I didn't even get a swab.

I feel really uneasy after this experience, and while I think it is just a sore throat myself, I almost want to go back, and just ask if I can get a swab or something done. I feel like I was brushed off.

I'm scared because Strep if left untreated becomes Sepsis, and where I am located I have 2 options, this one clinic (one I visited) or waiting in the hospital. 

I just don't know what to do and I'm getting really worried.",4.330625000000001,4.521929145833333,5.318055555555556,85.4325,70.04166666666666,8.9,28.5,8.841846274778883,1.9285333333333328,543,18,119,9,9,179,89,144,0.175,0.78,0.045,-0.9483,0,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,1,0,11,6,0,1,7,0,12,8,4,0,0,25,31,12,0,3,9,0,2,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,6,6,0,1,6,0,0,3,4,2,0,3,6,4,19,4,10,25,0,12,0,0,1,0,4,5,0,7,6,79,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17587091841482672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641929960241022,0.0,0.0,0.2701016244562904,0.14664608459934378,0.2141282973041669,0.19397267219901584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17976765319039426,0.0,0.1797333729894829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2320076678061861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15784747106232366,0.17180261810269715,0.0,0.0,0.17761048141949978,0.12547213546544198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2752827286166731,0.0,0.09981619001580257,0.1473124927335368,0.14046962592702447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19304643053116785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19082559375834232,0.0,0.0,0.17161066741693914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474873507233867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380267146018452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22502978834063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17583911150279913,0.0,0.0,0.1598895405605479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13521074031190888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11253843165906573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16782470449958875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10359279908962958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16281340159062532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17836367369653205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,SakkiOW,2019/02/07,"How do I know if its health anxiety or OCD? I obsess over my health A LOT right now. I got over my health anxiety once but now its back since a slight worry of my right hearing actually became true, I had a hearing problem in my right ear.

While I still worry about these things I also worry about things that are wrong with me in general, psychological or not. I'm kind of worried now that my health anxiety might be OCD? I've heard that OCD is harder to treat. 

OCD is obsessive thoughts as well and I have those with my health. How do I know if it's just health anxiety or if its OCD?

healthanxiety,swalam22,2019/02/07,"Why do I feel weak and sick all the time? Freaking out for a month now. Bloodwork/uralysis results: https://imgur.com/a/divyBwV

**Please click on the images and expand them before claiming they are too blurry to read.  Thank you.**

Bilirubin was elevated, but he said it was just Gilbert's syndrome?  He is my new family doctor (Canada).  Old family doctor would have done all sorts of clinical examination (feeling abdomen for things, listening to abdomen with stethoscope, neurological testing etc.), but new doctor barely looks at me.

Daily fatigue began last March, improved somewhat in September, then worsened again in January.  I've been experiencing the following symptoms for the past month+:

* Muscle weakness - hands and legs feel shaky and uncoordinated, worried I'm going to drop glasses when I pick them up to drink, legs shake while I'm walking up and down stairs, etc.  Worsens with exertion.
* Left hand feels weaker than right, and sometimes has pins and needles sensation.
* Extreme drowsiness
* Brain fog
* Flushing in legs, chest, head, and what feels like rapid temperature fluctuations from cold to warm.
* Lower left abdominal pain and discomfort.
* Nausea and dizziness
* Feel very hungry much of the time, often shortly after eating.  Gnawing feeling of hunger.
* Seem to never gain weight despite eating 4 meals a day.
* Mild urine retention due to tight bladder neck (began 2+ years ago, diagnosed via cystoscopy in November)
* Infrequent sharp pain near anus/rectum
* Very twitchy eyelids - Initially it was only my right eyelid, but now my left eyelid twitches as well as eyebrow and upper cheek on right side.

Stool is mostly normal, but:

* Undigested bits of food in stool
* Feel like bowels aren't completely voided, but can't push the rest out.  Feeling goes away after wiping.
* Stool sometimes broken up into large chunks instead of one long stool
* Stool sometimes thin and stringy

Symptoms can be up and down, but mostly down, and seem to correlate with food on some level, although I can't figure out any meaningful pattern.  I am unsure which symptoms are connected and which are not.  The fatigue and weakness worsens with exertion, even just going for walks, making exercise difficult.  

I am a 30 year old male.  I weigh 120-125lbs, and height is 5""6.  I haven't had alcohol in over 4 years, and I've never been a heavy drinker.  I eat reasonably healthy meals, and still maintain a reasonably high appetite in spite of these symptoms.

Most distressing symptom by far is the fatigue and weakness.  Can barely keep eyes open sometimes, and it can feel like I'm tied to a ball and chain.

I had an ultrasound and liver workup, in addition to the bloodwork above, which were apparently normal.

Doctor believes I have somatic issues related to anxiety and refuses to do additional testing or refer me to any specialist.  I cannot find a new doctor, because there is an extremely long waiting list for family doctors.  While I begged him for more investigation he practically sat there laughing at me and told me to go find another doctor if I wasn't happy.

I am worried, and my quality of life is suffering.  Should I just keep going to the hospital until they agree to investigate?  What should I do?",5.105347623485553,8.260449825225226,5.235950605778194,74.56682432432434,74.17117117117117,7.791550170860515,31.010406958682818,8.692141294856246,3.1668589624106867,2563,119,383,55,58,804,320,555,0.172,0.757,0.07200000000000001,-0.9961,3,0,3,0,0,0,110.0,0,1,4,1,16,25,1,4,19,0,40,57,17,5,4,94,72,42,0,6,12,0,17,3,0,3,29,2,0,1,10,37,12,5,20,4,0,9,9,17,1,1,15,24,30,8,68,53,13,88,0,4,3,0,14,43,0,12,38,236,40,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054248233857508384,0.06540192913578496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08323332268464527,0.0641713198715444,0.04681621561856771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057497428819093775,0.0,0.0,0.03730566355394392,0.0,0.05207489392083988,0.0689490613478943,0.0,0.0,0.06681224187592838,0.0,0.0,0.06831708062025117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06416481959101504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039467573977243535,0.0,0.0,0.062114566528489325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43847040961556205,0.0,0.06262668527772093,0.0,0.05995063042987694,0.0,0.1878621476834256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13650364061661804,0.04042062682083605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17307576258206628,0.0,0.30943490173453725,0.13115934689620956,0.0,0.0,0.111867519021034,0.0,0.1480014543964309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13912067667269884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06514628808260027,0.0,0.0,0.0628066870753538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06465892701814639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387469373050482,0.0,0.10879098667703964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04988444541951145,0.0,0.0,0.19947504803023813,0.0,0.043225877027195256,0.08969458826588514,0.0,0.0,0.10831640742369833,0.051390811525797546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04085006440628655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09769513818474923,0.0,0.04498748805049158,0.0,0.09439916550097524,0.17731590020799134,0.0,0.0,0.11992187033394384,0.0,0.0,0.12843377444680967,0.0,0.041469271663676886,0.04654375031796,0.1302377318822383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05842030728960955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06717690192778861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06121444745451653,0.0,0.0,0.12584323950231385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1567879819136993,0.05821320417687245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11142451476132664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24210509804965086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04887271116137548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31804018130292594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05634279163613527,0.0,0.0,0.04065715645003787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07136995944393351,0.0,0.0,0.0584772030686659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10098933094387336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07452253887405838,0.05502424947784995,0.0,0.05522157378735865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242988485863942,0.0,0.043473222671931086,0.0,0.0,0.11822829724233505

healthanxiety,vocalvee,2019/02/07,"Anyone have constant vivid dreams with health anxiety? Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know where to begin. These last few months have been absolutely unforgiving to me. I had three family members pass way in three months. I wish I was making this up. One died in October, November and early January. Also in November, I was diagnosed with early stage melanoma. 

Now I already suffer with severe health anxiety, however these events have really set me off. I focus on every aspect of my body, from my breathing, coughs, to my abdominal paints, to my moles. I have some symptoms that I hope are associated with health anxiety.

I have been focusing more on my breathing. Not that I have been having trouble breathing (I sleep well) but I focus on it more now, which makes me think I'm putting in more effort. 

Also, since October, I've been having very vivid dreams almost every night-  never ending ones. And I never wake up feeling like they're good dreams. I feel like all of my fears manifest in these dreams. I have had a vivid dream almost every night for months and I don't know how to get rid of them. I try praying right before I sleep, but that doesn't help all the time.

I need help :(",3.9141999999999975,6.186191742222222,4.635722222222224,81.86425000000003,73.8,7.7,24.13888888888889,8.548686976883017,1.7404888888888888,942,29,171,18,20,302,127,225,0.115,0.748,0.13699999999999998,0.8508,1,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,2,0,21,13,7,3,5,29,34,8,1,3,3,0,2,2,0,0,6,0,0,0,9,7,0,0,5,5,0,2,6,3,1,4,8,5,30,5,25,26,8,35,1,1,3,0,4,13,0,4,19,115,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2209708359545168,0.0,0.12175835655519747,0.176471082249905,0.0,0.11954884973899728,0.13407013725931533,0.0,0.0,0.25321987474515123,0.0,0.0,0.07714939328047142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09388768358551586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12255825833441453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11923385867677914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11198856741106968,0.11451119477814133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772481561533684,0.0,0.0,0.07287578976256248,0.0,0.27888814262333284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10401482179575428,0.124158508895141,0.11157824416706508,0.15764790968681086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05764592881959426,0.0,0.0,0.09254447795937888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35184555399026635,0.0,0.0,0.1479115918723692,0.0,0.0,0.10958839699804053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12127539765241675,0.08993844585656889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10780904819178076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14730007620391972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2642070736334891,0.0,0.0,0.0818126363308262,0.17019562238119995,0.0,0.0,0.207085445830295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14953285790268198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11091800640757456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068397221735458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09422621489670792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12464810711149407,0.0,0.09127095710237884,0.0,0.22083107082541234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11468119725808792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07069875891038033,0.0,0.0,0.06433772270346909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07491080099454091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910386333535752,0.0,0.08757946374915591,0.0,0.0,0.09920518191280343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12688078476644016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13407013725931533,0.0
healthanxiety,moondrop20,2019/02/07,"Boyfriend got water up nose when kayaking in river. I’m worried about brain eating amoeba, of course. So this is what happened:
(It’s summer here at the moment, we’re from Aus)
BF was kayaking, came across a fast-flowing current and flipped his kayak. He was pulled quickly to the surface by his life jacket. 
Got some water up his nose. 
He told me about it. 
I’m silently panicking and dreaming out thinking that he’s going to die. 
Here is a bit more extra information about the situation:
- water was fast flowing
- water was unpleasantly cold
- we have looked at the water from said river under the microscope before for unrelated reasons and could barely find any bacteria let alone amoeba 
- he has had water go up his nose as a child in a still, warmer dam (so badly that it went all the way into his throat) and it didn’t affect him.

healthanxiety,JacquesMouse,2019/02/07,"Rabies Scare So I came upon a branch that had some porcupine quills embedded in it, and was stupid enough to pull a few out to get a better look. A managed to poke myself in the finger with one - it didn't go very deep (no blood) and I pulled it out right away.

Anxiety reared its head and I was suddenly worried about exposure to rabies. I did call urgent care to see what they said. They didn't know the answer right away and had to do a bit of research. The verdict that came back was ""porcupines don't carry rabies, so you should be fine."" 

I wasn't particularly confident in this assessment since porcupines can like most mammals carry and transmit rabies. I'm wondering if she was just referring to the quills.

Any way I'm still kind of freaking out - Rabies does not seem like a fun way to go.

Any reassurances? I'm sure people have been stuck with quills before without getting rabies, right?",3.6160344827586215,5.6748561206896575,4.396068965517242,84.20582758620691,74.0,7.628505747126438,24.243678160919533,8.447377352677275,1.5942326436781613,711,22,136,13,15,228,107,174,0.119,0.775,0.106,-0.5106,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,2,1,6,12,1,1,10,0,17,3,3,0,1,25,34,8,0,2,4,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,8,12,0,0,5,0,0,6,7,3,0,1,15,4,10,9,23,17,5,24,0,0,2,0,7,13,0,5,5,86,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20432111254741214,0.0,0.11492441911381147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2822893102428101,0.11551647139865685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12783341957892688,0.0,0.0,0.1328649322086538,0.1640106528439098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534001321701784,0.3436428484902813,0.15316800501545524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13146600453172344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15522623666816152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15697641957691205,0.0,0.17075667845084405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15417781922841362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1564399028180268,0.08256167476206787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14678814904781354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261541345099081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10179874417552748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10414955156799773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3848830476231888,0.14290174005707998,0.0,0.15040497246594975,0.0,0.11971269331641395,0.1367624173033867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427059768719848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1199727031868537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14158861762774155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12395427569346315,0.0,0.238488839182958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14481494812313475,0.16291643935076008,0.0,0.15256437092964667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,CH112233,2019/02/07,"Feeling of something stuck in throat Hi all. i’m very new to reddit and i’ve been having the worst day. I’ve been having BPD flair ups all day and around night time i was eating dinner, stir fry with vegetables (soft ones). i had a feeling that a soft veggie peel got stuck in my throat. no matter what i did it wouldn’t come out. 

Long story short (trigger warning for some..



i made myself throw up to get it out. I saw some come out but then my throat still felt like there was a lump in it. I called a nurse and she said as long as i am breathing and can swallow (which i always could) i’m fine but its just feeling like there something stuck and that i’ll choke in my and die. Anyone else had this feeling? could this be all in my head? I hate healthy anxiety. i’ve been having panic attacks all night. just feels like there’s a lump in my throat now.

healthanxiety,kaayjay96,2019/02/07,Gotta love anxiety. My hypochondria has actually been in check for the last few months because I’ve been so busy and had no time to even think about anything besides school/work. As of lately life has been incredibly stressful and I ended up getting the flu. Due to the stress it caused my period to be late which stressed me even more. Then all the sudden I got a minor ache in my groin area where *i think* the lymph nodes are located. I thought I felt it swollen but couldn’t really tell as I was pushing pretty hard to feel something that I’m sure my anxiety was/is causing. Anyone have experience with swollen lymph nodes in the groin area? When they’re swollen is it clear and unquestionable that they are? It’s only the left side I’m experiencing it. I noticed if I’m occupied I don’t have any kind of ache. Stupid anxiety. If I could go to the doctor I would. It would ease my fear. But unfortunately money is tight and insurance doesn’t come cheap.,2.5581286549707585,4.9619896137566135,3.5233361180729617,87.51937343358402,78.78835978835978,6.941910331384015,24.23308270676692,8.032893268588372,1.3753428571428574,763,27,156,14,19,244,119,189,0.171,0.746,0.083,-0.9082,0,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,1,0,7,8,1,4,9,0,20,9,0,2,4,26,34,13,0,6,4,0,4,0,0,3,8,0,0,0,9,6,0,1,5,0,3,3,4,5,0,0,8,5,17,3,16,20,3,23,0,0,0,1,3,9,0,2,11,89,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.12998065087609625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09057824374070557,0.0,0.305685063568777,0.0,0.0,0.09313414759788743,0.0,0.1096094384768489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08119540052727596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27365916223822256,0.0,0.11473706196367205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063466329805082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13633234641480949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11797263743095375,0.0,0.0,0.17595017333148974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13029181629990638,0.0,0.14988318639053622,0.06734819432208672,0.0,0.12788960740443844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06958971697396865,0.0,0.07569868746424725,0.0,0.10652947492371838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11931797562312825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13870374403854524,0.0,0.1085729924106943,0.3005030938383088,0.0,0.14471847683031422,0.0,0.09408068545117323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12021511622756287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10631624154075234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15164519222372275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10130200321041503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13550880964065232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08532914157035157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13480205271747187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025412367578874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4577287063719957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12553620287692166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11641968415588252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17069398390236015,0.0,0.10574320846027548,0.07766799851028237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096968698568455,0.0,0.0,0.18923806150531425,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Sweetpotatojones,2019/02/07,"Does chlorine definitely kill brain eating amoebas? Sorry to spam this sub with two posts about this. but as I said earlier, I purposely snorted water up my nose after I vomited earlier, because my nose was burning really bad from puking. I'm in Florida right now where according to the CDC the brain eating amoeba naegleria fowleri is common. In a panic I researched the water quality and according to the internet this town's tap water is chlorinated.

healthanxiety,popcyclez,2019/02/07,Muscle twitches Please help I’m going crazy. Ever since the beginning of December I’ve been having muscle spasms and they’ve gotten worse... I try to tell myself that it’s just anxiety but I’m really afraid that it’s not :( I only notice them when I’m at rest (sitting or laying down) and I don’t think I have muscle weakness ... just really tired and haven’t really been working out. But the muscle twitches ARE ALL OVER MY BODY literally in places I didn’t think I could have them... I’m just really scared it’s als. I have a lot going on so I haven’t gone to the doctor I’m going tomorrow though.. hopefully I will get some answers ,1.4329568106312287,3.7782935193798473,3.6454318936877113,85.33831395348841,82.7984496124031,6.786489479512737,18.516611295681066,7.957251820313856,0.8879541528239199,500,12,98,10,14,171,78,129,0.124,0.794,0.08199999999999999,-0.7327,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,2,1,7,4,0,2,4,0,13,6,1,0,2,20,28,9,0,2,7,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,5,4,0,0,3,0,0,4,5,3,0,0,5,0,13,1,9,21,4,16,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,4,4,62,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14253138590919678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20695530039972854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14875832801766725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19070252944547486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16853367310805067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09734252654870264,0.0,0.31766337677218176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1248838240056508,0.0,0.0,0.1850540300529519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1583993737092244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21212223288022095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417018686918252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946607775503246,0.20451924202639848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4774357241198165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865350230917989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541226890916864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16284857430839586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23876780050614035,0.18305472421859628,0.0,0.0,0.21414306800534447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12649647223859234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356404153551002,0.0,0.18987212907359874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,maskedforthehype,2019/02/08,anxiety over leg numbness so i've had crippling anxiety/health anxiety for 2 years now. it's been such a torture in my life and i still havent gone to see a therapist (mostly financial reasons). but anyway two nights ago my left leg started feeling restless while i was lying in bed and i didn't think much of it and went to bed with no problem. i woke up forgetting about it until i remembered and the feeling came back even worse. it feels like how your limbs feel after they fall asleep and you wake them up - slightly numb and tingly and sometimes it feels kinda like how your legs burn after you exercise. this has been going on for two days and it's caused me so much panic because i automatically think its DVT. it was so bad that last night i had the worst panic attack i've ever had and i legitimately could not breathe. i took a xanax and i could breathe again and went to sleep but i've been dealing with it all day and my breathing has been hay wire today which is especially great since DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism which is shortness of breath so lol.... i'm going to the doctor tomorrow but i'm scared as hell. i'm trying to convince myself it's just a pinched nerve but it's so hard. i really hate living like this because i'm not even living at all.,3.007400568181815,4.900325109375004,3.97474431818182,87.29127840909092,75.25,6.685795454545455,24.91761363636364,7.520522993642371,1.1572406249999996,1012,34,205,13,22,326,151,256,0.243,0.682,0.07400000000000001,-0.9947,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,4,2,1,18,18,4,4,7,1,18,16,10,5,3,44,40,26,0,3,7,0,6,3,0,0,6,0,2,0,16,15,0,0,9,1,0,9,5,13,0,2,16,7,22,5,24,22,6,37,1,0,1,0,7,9,1,2,22,132,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10377656229738999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1791183074984437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13318540014828215,0.0,0.0900205326451511,0.09774956868573084,0.14273104366937814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13389827392681156,0.0,0.12026437945468313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18694366697450032,0.0,0.0,0.15100248831453414,0.1206952749590826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11982734220976067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15464885763433805,0.1058976101686182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29597360202719664,0.08363569444989757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133068530926755,0.0,0.0,0.1290714202145321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10487280731798042,0.11558358065968495,0.0,0.1244412197008947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542865987760016,0.0,0.0,0.12719821013318705,0.0,0.08269085647939806,0.17158523632977313,0.0,0.206752043171074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17212161666084366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21972679633864334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2747156765803796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11202133532807138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499881368069038,0.12036870009648888,0.0,0.0,0.13261885709544352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11720870253332125,0.0,0.0932905955856137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968425131107577,0.0,0.11715575551423285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11578641830192887,0.0,0.08286360364678544,0.0,0.09349321800600607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13592869585257555,0.0,0.15002900602900238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096981649022604,0.0,0.1300704197939928,0.07948366553572725,0.0,0.2287231183799484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21705236556737265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11930556271464204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753900196782496
healthanxiety,GalacticWolf87,2019/02/08,"Excited to find this community, I have a phobia of having a heart attack and dying. I am a 31 year old woman, and I have a fear of dying from a heart attack/stroke. Every time I have a back pain, arm pain, jaw pain, nausea or uncomfortable chest feelings I get worried it’s signs of a heart attack. I’ve talked to my GP about and she just told me I’m too young to worry about that, my bloodwork came back normal in October 2018. I haven’t had any deaths in my immediate family who have heart attacks but one of my grandfathers had a stroke and an uncle had some heart issue when he ended up getting a pace maker. I’ve eaten horrible since I was a kid and am trying to change my habits now (cutting out red meat, working out) but I feel like what if I’m too late? I mean I was that kid whose parents got them McDonald’s all the time. I’m not overweight, but I am at the high end of my normal BMI for my height. I just wish I could take a straight forward test to tell me if my arteries are getting close to getting clogged. I smoke marijuana too, and yes there are some times where it makes me more paranoid so I’m going to try to switch to an herbal vape. It feels good just to get this all out.

healthanxiety,alohaxfab,2019/02/08,"Diabetics Ketoacidosis and Brain Cancer Hi I'm new here. I started having very mild health anxiety when I was younger but it recently increased the last few months. In December, I went to the ER due to chest pains because I was sure I was having a heart attack even though I was terrified. I went to the doctor and they said it was just acid reflux and they sent me home with a prescription. After that, I had to follow-up with my PCP and she told me there was an abnormality in my EKG (my second one) and referred me to a cardiologist to do an echocardiogram. That same week, I was worrying about every little ache and symptom that I've read about heart attacks and kept manifesting each one. It sucked because I didn't feel like it was all in my head and I kept freaking out. Mind you, I'm a college student away from home which made everything worse. Winter break came and I went home. I didn't feel any symptoms and I wasn't worried about my health anymore. Then I came back to school last month and my friend had a stroke. She's 19 so I was surprised at how young she was to be having a stroke. This event stirred up my past anxieties about my heart and I found myself checking my heart rate often throughout my day again. I would also google every possible heart condition that I could have that I wouldn't know of. The next week, I finally got my echocardiogram done and the doctor said it was completely normal which eased my mind at little bit. That same week, I had on and off nausea which I was sure was because of how anxious I was about my health. The next few days go by and I start having tension headaches (or so I think). They were on and off as well but it just hurt to the point where I was convinced I had brain cancer. With the nausea and the headaches, I just assumed. I tried to refrain from googling the symptoms because I knew it would elevate my worries but I couldn't resist. The last few days, I've been so worried about having brain cancer because I wouldn't be able to focus and some things were hard to remember, but there is no family history of any type of cancer so I kept trying to focus on that. Now, I am currently worrying that I have Diabetic Ketoacidosis. I have no family history of diabetes and I've never been told that I should watch out for it because I am 18, normal weight, and have been healthy. But lately, I've been stress eating because of how anxious I've been and food makes me feel a little better. However, I always feel guilty right after eating and it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I just don't know how to cope with this anymore and I have a doctor's appointment next week so hopefully she can ease my mind a bit more.

healthanxiety,kaiyamazaki,2019/02/08,"what are the early symptoms of Colon cancer? (23 yrs old) (worried so much) My stomach has been having some problem for a month now, it started from a sharp sting pain in my upper middle abdomen I was checked for a possible of ulcer but turned out negative and took some ultrasound but everything is normal, I was given a Omeprazole and some antacid syrup (Aluminium hydroxide dried gel, Magnesium hydroxide) and it worked. I changed my diet, but after some time my upper left side of my abdomen begins to hurt every time I finished my food and it will go away if I release a gas or burp but moving to this week I feel suddenly feel a discomfort in my stomach ( I feel that it is filled with air) and every time I release a gas its turns ok then after a half an hour it will the discomfort will begin again. I started to search for some symptoms relating to what I'm experiencing and it kind of leads me to colon cancer though I'm not sure how to examine myself on bloody stool, and I haven't experience vomit nor nausea.  


All the test was done on a clinic, I really want to do an endoscopy to make sure so I suggested to my parents to have it checked in a hospital since we have insurance even if we live in a different country but they told me to wait and have it checked in a hospital during my vacation to our home country which is 1st week of March but I can't wait that much because of the symptoms and its giving me some worries ",5.2988888888888885,5.84334985915493,6.185868544600941,78.81492175273866,68.01408450704226,9.409702660406886,32.327073552425674,9.444778638647367,2.9098754303599383,1136,47,217,22,18,376,154,284,0.146,0.8270000000000001,0.027000000000000003,-0.9887,2,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,3,0,1,2,7,9,0,2,18,1,20,19,6,3,3,44,40,24,0,5,10,1,4,0,0,3,11,0,1,0,16,13,2,2,4,0,3,5,5,5,0,1,8,5,30,4,34,29,9,41,0,1,0,0,8,15,0,9,21,157,46,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11515303513147955,0.0,0.0,0.07471395632918959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12965659860277287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12805342988513074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12542565881761064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08095245223888113,0.0,0.20653113212003585,0.0,0.1101527374765518,0.11989123780246455,0.0,0.0,0.18591632100169808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482050330567363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11757468210165832,0.06965601983182293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12294181611958772,0.0,0.12070097983895685,0.0,0.13120743658890116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12763168119738116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13316628636242386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10822637267500368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08181250880801487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09782951960303403,0.13026627399892346,0.18019747659516028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008682502174378,0.0,0.0,0.1286104374116871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041687622298773,0.0,0.13609296238871638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13817264149447214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11727732020269188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07851772040650057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138631525915816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17350304474718695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310304849429943,0.3821731815454962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204186358847146,0.0,0.21440439031728545,0.0,0.0,0.11711527902480005,0.1361732586600945,0.0,0.26662915752852656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07229149967233668,0.0,0.1966271050010049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892281467065134,0.2489396477728811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,funkylittlelesbian,2019/02/08,"The cycle starts again I'm diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder but only this year have i experienced the terror of health anxiety. I went through a throat infection, which I of course thought was cancer at first, I spent hours rechecking and researching my symptoms, which started to completely take over my life. I couldn't go a second without a distraction. After the infection cleared up I was basically rid of my fears. 

Except a few days ago, I had an incredibly terrifying panic attack. I was just lying in bed and I had this faint pain in my left arm and for some reason my brain just short circuited, I jumped up, my heart started racing which led me to think I was having a heart attack. I genuinely thought I was going to die, I felt dizzy and for the first time I couldn't calm myself down. I was terrified so I went to see my mother and I just crawled into her arms like a 20 year old baby and after a few minutes everything went back to normal. And now I'm back in the cycle again. Asking myself ""what if that WASN'T a panic attack?"" and other completely illogical questions. I keep checking my heart beat, sometimes I get a spike of anxiety when I think it's too slow and same for when i believe it's too fast. 

I can't break out of this and it's taking over everything I'm so scared and so sick of living like this, does anyone have any advice on how to just make my brain chill for like just a second?",4.56139285714286,5.794218067857145,5.5892857142857135,79.92571428571429,70.10714285714286,8.742857142857144,27.214285714285715,9.120678840339163,2.189157142857142,1129,37,215,22,20,373,151,280,0.263,0.691,0.046,-0.9972,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,3,18,14,3,6,16,0,15,18,8,4,1,41,39,19,1,4,9,1,1,3,0,0,10,0,1,0,13,14,0,1,7,0,2,7,5,10,0,4,16,3,36,4,34,21,4,45,0,0,1,0,4,14,0,3,26,153,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09516442223217736,0.08632676783116952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06622578480699877,0.0,0.2234999532180361,0.0,0.0,0.06809451985685973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09104271615143064,0.3323717281409117,0.0,0.14976756696616114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10972061554650804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21742985303811665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2042146293024717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06280588054796997,0.0,0.0,0.0988446882477902,0.101071239773789,0.0,0.11161273464410007,0.0,0.08522310021714997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1750484229064042,0.0,0.0,0.10958626749820903,0.0,0.0,0.09350578316867597,0.0,0.0,0.16567287689077587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05088013888071107,0.0,0.11069335812097614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10351670978425613,0.0,0.34620845527830674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09590554283121976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656110605979472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10581011850480344,0.0,0.06878657580312901,0.14273356653932268,0.0,0.08599357713498923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500587715265743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954175529971205,0.0,0.0,0.10219017136551413,0.0,0.0,0.07406640257163574,0.10362551592543666,0.2285228562859567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090945506693458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10012897514943607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09750032403647188,0.0,0.07760399272884133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096317193684924,0.0,0.206790827773932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122128939510427,0.1464442275911193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12480196765712825,0.0,0.15462713073436912,0.05678653000224526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2708332510935173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09387657958267988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254267164275731
healthanxiety,Ihatebeingmorid,2019/02/08,"I’m probably crazy I used to have horrible HA, and for whatever reason it stopped, I think I was so busy that I didn’t have time to think about it.

However I just went to get a routine std checkup and I kinda mentioned in passing that I’ve been itchy (everywhere not just crotch reason.) Keep in mind I’ve had dry skin my whole life and my parents said I used to always itch when I was a kid. So in passing the nurse decided to mention the potential for SCABIES, and like a switch my mind started racing. I knew very little about scabies and now I swear I have them. The areas of my body that tend to itch are my sides and crotch region, also my arms and shoulders. 

However through my frantic googling and recent discovery of this subreddit I now think it’s diabetes. I’m going to a derm on Tuesday to check for scabies even tho I now changed my mind on what it is.

Keep In mind I didn’t think anything of it until this nurse said something! (She didn’t even check me out either to see.)

healthanxiety,cariame,2019/02/08,"Intense bought of health anxiety for the first time in quite a while. I recently started on an SSRI and have been doing fairly well for the past few weeks; thoughts related to my health anxiety are present but I have been able to drive the worries away quickly. This morning was different.

I had just woken up and was laying in bed when I had a random thought; my chest feels fairly still. Normally I'm very aware of my heartbeat--due to anxiety, I think. I place my hand over my chest and realize I can't feel my heartbeat. I check my wrist and I can't feel it, either. I immediately get sent into a panic attack and jump up and start pacing furiously, hand over my chest. Now, logically, I know that if my pulse has stopped, I wouldn't be able to jump up, pace around, etc.--however, I just can't shake that sense of impending doom. When pacing, I can feel my fluttering heartbeat, but now when I'm sitting down again I can't feel it. I made the mistake of looking up why I might not be able to feel my pulse and read that a weak pulse is considered a medical emergency, so now I'm absolutely paralyzed with fear. 

Has anyone had any experience with this? Am I in real danger, or is this my over-active brain sending me into a panic over nothing at all?

healthanxiety,wiriercane,2019/02/08,"Wearing a monitor for two weeks... any tips to take your mind off of it? My cardiologist has me wearing a small monitor for two weeks as my palpitations tend to be sporadic. Even though it’s small and just sticks to my chest, it’s been one day and it’s driving me nuts. I’m always aware that it’s there and that’s making my anxiety and, ironically, my palpitations worse just knowing it’s recording everything. Trying to sleep last night was awful so now I know my anxiety will be worse today.

Has anyone worn one for awhile and do you have any tips for trying to take your mind off of it?",2.5740600924499226,4.711317500000002,3.9936363636363663,85.53664869029278,77.38983050847456,7.3417565485362095,23.43913713405239,8.296473431620573,1.382837288135594,467,15,96,9,11,154,67,118,0.147,0.853,0.0,-0.9378,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,2,1,9,4,4,1,0,12,17,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,9,5,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,3,0,12,0,14,11,0,12,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,7,62,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434182725597944,0.0,0.0,0.23442296573716584,0.0,0.2637115942487749,0.0,0.0,0.12051891375703573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111586735189082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11384290462843245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15490707495925465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894503452202977,0.14049733042260185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11505239656187034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3480712250706228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16174924989770514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335927327373829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17248561296475232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2591882470479283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16934394081177953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16337820309286796,0.0,0.0,0.2340437942709476,0.0,0.3367435692750254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2765154129727887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3513014452361194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Mango-sex-fest,2019/02/08,"I think I am a textbook case of health anxiety. So, this all starts about 5 weeks ago. I had  strange discomfort in my side's and went to the gp when they didn't seem to get better. She ordered a full blood work and also gave me a physical examination. Bloods came back completely fine with only a slightly elevated pancreas enzyme  ( base is 100 mine was 107 ) and for some unknown reason to myself and to the doctor I convinced myself I had pancreatic cancer. Ever since the discomfort has shifted from my side's to the top of my abdomen and I obsess over every little niggle I feel. I'm constantly poking at my glands in my neck ( 5 years ago i also convinced myself I had lymphoma ) and now I'm checking every little thing my body does. They gave me  CA19.9 blood test ( used to detect tumour growth in pancreatic cancer cases ) and mine was 6.1 ( normal health person is between 1-35 ) so that should have made me feel better, it didn't. They then sent for an ultrasound which showed everything looks exactly like it should. I've literally heard from 6 doctors now mostly at the accident and emergency department, they are 99.9% I don't have pancreatic cancer  and that I probably have gastritis. So I'm getting a camera down my throat next month to test for that. 

No matter how many times they said I was ok I just keep thinking they're wrong. Something is wrong. I know my body and this doesn't feel right. I did loose some weight and my appetite went away but has since come back. So how they're throwing all these anti anxiety drugs my way: 

Diazapam - 10mg 
Propanalol - 10mg
Olanzapine - 20mg, 10mg and 5mg ( depending how bad I feel at the time ) 

I'm not having restful sleeps constantly struggling to distract myself. 

I just want some advice. The kind of advice from someone who's been through this rabbit hole.... I just don't know what to do... 

I'm sorry if the post makes little sense I'm writing it on my phone and I'm not the most educated person in the world.

I should also note I've been suffering from social anxiety since I was 10.

healthanxiety,TheRomadian,2019/02/08,"Scared of Pulmonary Embolism Hey guys, so the past few days or so I've been very worried about a PE. Today was especially bad, with a pain on the right side of my back below my shoulder that was like a pulsating pain with my heart beat. It went on throughout the day and aspirin didn't help, every time I made a small adjustment I'd get the pains. Then suddenly when I came home they went away, but about half an hour ago I felt a sharp pain on the left side of my back that felt like it also hurt in my chest. I've kind of been on edge since then and have been experiencing various sharp pains in my chest. I went to the doctor today and they took my blood pressure and pulse which were normal, and the doc listened to my heart yesterday and it was fine. Would these seem off if I did have a PE? Can anxiety cause these sharp pains, they don't feel like surface level pains",7.8607402234636865,5.476510234636873,7.3094343575419005,82.50984986033521,63.97206703910614,10.737709497206703,31.87220670391061,8.841846274778883,2.1493960893854758,688,17,154,8,8,215,105,179,0.203,0.743,0.054000000000000006,-0.9801,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,3,1,8,16,0,2,14,0,14,15,6,2,0,21,26,15,0,3,3,0,6,3,0,1,9,1,1,1,8,9,0,0,5,0,0,5,2,11,0,1,17,8,16,5,19,8,2,36,0,1,0,0,7,16,0,3,18,91,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08543270453908923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707293092890316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372840795306017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054969164455244,0.14821646425106244,0.0804710604733674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11023001168512424,0.0,0.09900608546933204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12431083361456965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09864630024431137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08120207299406715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048731283314046366,0.06885199716274805,0.1850747374619368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050353186863253886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542872763036503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22841524447798345,0.06459970528100142,0.0,0.09667433886687604,0.0,0.09491227472323124,0.0,0.10317394509864117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10036217771683666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471427135029368,0.0,0.0,0.1412553130891288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911945776392766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442933886958947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7178660588170898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920030846509341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230572918617507,0.0,0.0,0.09649053920521967,0.0,0.0,0.08773831856922525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07972433877415418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0561984070684767,0.0,0.182708914905054,0.0,0.1070787805794851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.079521406123474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2680283034027727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09787587586467228,0.0,0.06846370330965294,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Nage020203,2019/02/08,"Heart Failure? Male 17

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 months ago i had my first panic attack. This was accompanied with palpitations and i was shaking very bad. I thought i was having a heart attack. I conitnued having these panic attacks but I understood that I wasn't having one heart attack every day so I tried convincing myself it was anxiety. I went to see a doctor after a while just to make sure nothing was wrong with me and I got a referal to the hospital to have a 24h EKG taken. I did and they noticed some ""extra-beats"". My heart rate was also pretty high for short periods during these 24 hours for unexplained reasons. I assume anxiety. I recently got another referal to a cardiologist and I am going to do a lot of different tests to make sure that nothing is wrong. I got the referal to the cardiologist 2 weeks ago but I haven't recieved a letter, phone call or anything. So who knows how long it will take? I recently started having a cough. It feels like theres some wet thing stuck in my throat and I clear my throat all the time. I can sometimes feel it in my lungs as well. This accompanied with shortness of breath. Now I have managed, thanks to the help of Dr. Google, to diagnose myself with Congestive Heart Failure. Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

healthanxiety,sheeparefriends,2019/02/09,"Underside of my jaw is more swollen on one side than the other? I'm so scared Hey guys, not sure what I'm looking for here. I'm home alone, don't have anyone to talk to and am freaking out.

I don't know how to explain it but I'll do my best, so. Behind my chin underneath my jawline, one side is more swollen than the other when I tense my neck muscles. I first discovered it when I was prodding my neck, it's very pronounced when I tilt my head to the side. I tilted my head to the left, tensed my muscles and it felt like a huge mass under my jaw. I can feel a similar shape on the left side of my neck but it's nowhere near as big. It looks big in the mirror too. 

When I'm relaxed I can't feel anything. There is no pain and I haven't found any lumps, but I'm really starting to panic now. My mam comes back from holiday on Monday so I'll have her feel it. I don't want to go to the doctor because I just had a totally harmless cyst needlessly removed because I was convinced it was dangerous and I don't want him to think I'm hysterical (which I am, to be fair)

I'm pretty sure it's always been like this, but I seem to be having a bad anxiety flare up. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I'm really going insane here!",1.502451481103165,2.814242426966296,3.5064776983316333,91.5390628192033,77.91385767790263,6.652298263534219,23.372318692543413,7.348242739294969,0.7622898876404496,956,30,222,12,22,325,136,267,0.165,0.715,0.12,-0.7837,0,1,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,2,16,14,1,2,11,0,23,13,7,1,3,28,50,17,0,2,6,0,4,2,0,0,6,0,1,2,15,6,0,0,10,2,0,4,8,6,0,3,7,6,29,8,29,41,4,34,0,0,2,0,8,21,0,1,11,139,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14335374253807734,0.0,0.0,0.11517039690631108,0.0,0.0,0.09412533537749736,0.0,0.10588528377987813,0.0,0.0,0.19356265954644372,0.0,0.11390180170314045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643076945365204,0.11556876529485105,0.16875011018359018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452555167397913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11923022562101185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14167119276268642,0.12112582603930995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20995675503873146,0.0,0.13289783165479455,0.0,0.0,0.11773371312808607,0.0,0.15176230556387074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15732617571180846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13705026578529966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841025826790781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1388391542601646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15213592426977854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30077145690676205,0.0,0.0,0.135242839922981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2324634996737817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18758396167808927,0.0,0.14728079808451186,0.16239739968371156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14081540585556612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17734135121398698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13857518980096295,0.0,0.0,0.12600566074865538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979691725508232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2609045331378547,0.0,0.0,0.2225016594664425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886892250181182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11420491622875867,0.1632787116946951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,koroshiai210,2019/02/09,"Worried about diagnosis I've been having some issues with my heart for the last 4 years (I'm turning 19 this year). By that I mean I'm having symptoms like heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain in my chest / left arm / back and dizziness. 

Every time I went to my cardiologist I was told I had mitral valve prolapse and that my symptoms were caused by anxiety. I wasn't given anything about my prolapse. However, the last time I went to my cardiologist she said that along with my MVP I also have a leakage on my pulmonary valve and  a distention of the aorta in the Valsalva sinus (I'm actually trying to translate my doctor's note in English so there might be some mistakes). 

She said that I should avoid things like coffee and energy drinks and that I'm okay. She also said I must go for an exam every 2 years. She didn't really explain if my symptoms are solely from anxiety however.

That's actually why I'm writing this post to see if those other conditions beside MVP mentioned in my doctor's note are serious because I can't get it out of my mind these days. I've lately been experiencing dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain and heart palpitations and I can't figure out if these are caused by anxiety or something more serious.. I'm also worried about my aorta and the possibility of me having an aneurysm after reading the note.",5.130520195838437,6.701987910852715,6.262378620971031,74.35004283965729,69.11627906976744,8.687392900856793,30.63321093431253,9.134995656068208,2.799547286821705,1083,44,188,21,19,362,131,258,0.08,0.883,0.037000000000000005,-0.8225,2,1,2,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,1,10,1,20,17,8,2,1,31,39,16,0,6,4,0,0,2,0,3,8,3,0,0,14,13,1,1,3,2,0,3,4,6,0,0,14,5,29,3,29,21,3,25,0,0,1,0,11,10,0,7,13,123,43,4,0.0,0.0,0.19866969995530176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24421040849410214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2336130779877281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08376659951958029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0782721915551494,0.0,0.062051796755046885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20913798817530493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06564777692023614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20837798683014191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09971795112000824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1715292358155491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05318240868162647,0.0,0.0578510548461097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3618740035441544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10624498093767673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16594903687660095,0.11482643586968648,0.0,0.11059790890443304,0.0,0.0,0.09946140131518837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11088193396113727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10798581476553656,0.10278146280642116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2166289109670742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475581120810315,0.09748912967818224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10182010156253034,0.0,0.06521091731331982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29048409034355216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08111548724950197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07836488201291765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174043211151149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06762645047253636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11871211488912682,0.0,0.0,0.0972671485758051,0.0,0.06911046304115576,0.11072106942799992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18872543669738895,0.0918519481148526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20675056156597632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19665320415942747
healthanxiety,pissedatevantide2,2019/02/09,"Relatively new anxiety causing constant fear of testicular torsion Hey, so I know this sounds just ridiculous but ever since I learned about this happening I keep on thinking that it will happen to me. It's lost me sleep, I have lost appetite and I end up thinking about it way more often than I'd like to and I don't know how to stop. My anxiety has started relatively recently but it's been very strong and it's honestly been the most frustrating thing I've ever had to deal with. Any advice on either assuring myself that nothing is wrong or anything else?",4.282222222222224,6.3418546296296325,5.260370370370372,78.72166666666669,72.14814814814815,8.503703703703705,31.44444444444445,9.150863307647796,2.9925111111111105,452,21,81,10,9,148,77,108,0.166,0.68,0.155,0.3881,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,3,8,10,2,1,1,0,8,1,1,2,3,23,18,8,0,0,5,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,10,4,0,2,5,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,5,1,10,4,12,12,3,12,0,2,0,0,2,3,0,3,9,56,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671492052870886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11632064841413707,0.0,0.26170732497033705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14076052294008864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17571665049691335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18484552741918173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763462260627673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14289128802847187,0.0,0.1515005492972207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094511182584889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1924801001577504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.302519936213116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15203812251774373,0.0,0.0,0.18801047865775172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08356695235197772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.373445075114536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16520226772215538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16412819285742675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16889237605150215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414952798716089,0.0,0.1711746823019478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12107088521920575,0.0,0.0,0.14300642157193952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11363878428503167,0.21920534190035226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14113511367086534,0.0,0.1357724420517692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870175817844299,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,papapatahto,2019/02/09,"My leg gave out when I was a 1st grader.  I'm not sure if I post in the right subreddit

&amp;#x200B;

I suddenly recall being paralyzed when I was a 1st grader.

Well, i remember that one morning I woke up, climbed down the bed, and flop, I was on the floor. I was thinking that ""well maybe i'm just sleepy"". And I couldn't stand up no matter how hard I tried. So I cried out really loud. I forget the detail but i was just a kid and not very heavy to begin with so my parents have to carry me to school. And yep I sat at my own seat all day and couldn't attend the school weekly meeting in the school yard.

healthanxiety,Goldie2618,2019/02/10,"Throat ear stuff going on I’m having the worst day.. I’ve been having random symptoms that have triggered me in a huge way.

I had a bad bout of colds for almost two months and when I finally recovered I felt like I had a grain of rice in the back of my throat. Now I’m prone to tonsil stones and noticed a bit come out but the feeling was still there. It almost feels as though one is lodged deep and I can’t get to it or see it. Additionally I’ve had some dull ear pain off and on. I went to urgent care and the doctor got out a tiny bit of something in the back of my throat but it didn’t resolve it completely. She said my throat looked healthy but I still worry she missed something. Today I made the stupid mistake of checking my throat for the billionth time and noticed a white patch In the back of my throat and went down a google spiral. I feel so anxious it’s hard to function. I have a little baby and he deserves better than what I’m giving him right now. I feel like a failure and yet I can’t break out of this vicious cycle. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? I did make an ent appt and I’m scared shitless.

healthanxiety,bonzman15,2019/02/10,"A story about my anxiety in the recent past, and issues i'm facing today (a little long) As my title says, I've been having an intense battle with anxiety lately. I have anxiety and depression that I was treating with Zoloft until the end of last February. I am a 21 year old male that lives in the Midwest.

**1. Last Year**

Around mid-june of last year, I had started to get some insomnia (the kind that wakes you up early), which I then blamed on the fact that my basement room is incomplete and family upstairs made a lot of noise. I also had brain fog, with all the complications that accompany it, which I had blamed on my lack of sleep. It sucked, but I decided I should wait for my mind to improve on their own. During this time, I had a slight, but long lasting, bit of anxiety about something unrelated.

During this time, I decided to drink 30ml of Zzzquil before bed in order to help me go to sleep quicker, and I would sometimes take a sip of it if I had woken up too early.

**2. A few months ago**

I lived with everything until mid-December, in which I started to have pain in my testicles and prostate, as well as my upper back and in random parts of my body. Long story short, I started to get intense anxiety about possible cancer. In order to slightly control it, I stopped drinking coffee every day and quit smoking weed once a week. Eventually, I had an ultrasound and a CT scan done, which found nothing. The symptoms associated with my lower region faded a couple of days after.

At some point along the way, I started having more symptoms, such as forgetfulness, possible confusion, numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, a feeling of dizziness or vertigo, a slight shaky feeling in my upper left arm, and what I can only describe as brain zaps. I also felt like my memory was getting a lot worse. These symptoms seemed to persist even on days when the anxiety seemed less bad. I made the mistake of googling my symptoms and good old brain cancer showed up. I pushed my doctor to give me an MRI, which later turned up nothing.

**3. A few days ago**

Over the time after I got the MRI results back, the anxiety seemed to come down from a constant 5-8 to a 2-3 (on a scale from 0-10), and while a couple of symptoms seemed to disappear over the next week and a half, I started to get new ones, such as random twitches and fasciculations in random, varying parts of my body (which I blamed on drinking coffee again) and trouble going to sleep/getting woken up in the middle of the night (which I blamed on weaning myself off of the Zzzquil I had mentioned before). When I started to go to sleep or wake up, I would also have thoughts that would make no sense. I still have these symptoms today, which is my motivation for writing this post.

I confess I still worried about things like spinal cancer and whether or not anything was actually wrong with me (aside from the anxiety), so I made the same mistake of googling again last wednesday. This time, I came across brain prion diseases, specifically vCJD, which threw me in to another state of panic and anxiety, possibly even greater than the last couple. 

**4. Today and the future**

This time, I'm worried that it might be the real deal, despite the hilariously low odds I have of actually having it. The worst part is, rationally I know I probably don't have what I'm so scared of. Luckily I had a doctor's appointment the next day after my latest googling mistake, and they set me up with a sort of behavioral counselor, as well as having me start on a different antidepressant.

I guess what I'm seeking by writing this post is reassurance that I won't be a clinically insane mess of a human due to some brain issue in 6 months. I'm constantly auditing my environment, past experiences, and my own thoughts in order to make sure I'm not hallucinating or something (like when I woke up around a week ago in the middle of the night to the smell of something burning, which could have just been my heater) 

I just feel skeptical sometimes that ALL of the symptoms I'm feeling or have felt can be due to solely anxiety, when it's never been this bad before.

The past few months have made me mentally tired, due to having to put up with the stress of daily life in addition to everything above. The insomnia and the anxiety have definitely taken a toll on me. I just hope it actually is just anxiety and nothing serious.

healthanxiety,MumbleWithTheBumble,2019/02/10,"Fell on ice and hit my head Basically like the title says, I was walking to the bus stop and I fell and hit my head pretty hard. Felt like I was gonna stay on the ground for a good bit. Didn't lose consciousness, I think, as I made it to the bus on time. I'll be home in around three hours but I'm terrified. Back then my vision was blurry and walking was a bit difficult. My balance is a bit better now but the blurry vision part still scares me. My head hurts. I took a few pain killers and wrote my mom, who told me to sleep and rest a bit but I'm terrified that maybe I need help asap and sleeping will just end with me passing out. Google, as always, never helps and I also think I might have like a small amount of internal bleeding or something. I'm struggling to stay calm. How should I go about this?

healthanxiety,Majestic_United,2019/02/11,"Very small red lump underneath armpit Just a bit of a background I have always been very self conscious of my health from worrying about the smallest symptoms, to convincing myself I had ALS disease. Anyways, today after a good hour and a half workout I noticed right after a slight discomfort underneath my left armpit. I looked to check it out and there was a very small red bump that is somewhat tender to the touch. I don't know if this is just something minor like a pimple, cyst, etc. Keep in mind I stared to mysteriously break out on my face with two pimples just this morning which is quite rare. 

Or could it be a lymph node that has gone rouge. Everywhere else on my body seems normal just this one spot on my armpit. Ive been down this road before in the past, so im not freaking out about anything yet. Just wondering if anyone else in here has had something similar to this?",7.515964912280701,6.917846795321638,6.794269005847955,80.19210526315794,63.50292397660819,9.705263157894738,33.03508771929825,8.841846274778883,2.5398701754385966,706,24,136,9,9,217,112,171,0.032,0.903,0.065,0.67,0,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,12,6,0,1,11,0,15,11,5,0,0,24,21,6,0,4,9,0,1,1,0,0,6,0,0,1,10,6,0,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,0,3,6,5,13,4,25,13,3,25,0,0,4,0,1,17,0,6,7,94,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13159750781274066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058555100161406,0.16204833750778694,0.1301479689412522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345781318567749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17266413850969214,0.17567438901868926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12627378151451168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2642361725839915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763844682406676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13265278769062155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16811121384554326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15575067304084864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17083438152224567,0.0,0.0,0.14057530075920266,0.0,0.0,0.0869177714954702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17183571131709835,0.0,0.0,0.07726647281531795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13281024480354628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15969131737214382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1549581771865495,0.0,0.1800603491987771,0.0,0.0,0.10716982195762706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15097670346646724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16821715459252176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13506338092987355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14397823894199038,0.16499000471754835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24351066627500126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16438344942267505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14991230876094472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15449431128130675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914829528952653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17151219242043306,0.0,0.16061393096770865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,wnttak,2019/02/11,"How can I function? Bit of background. I suffered with anxiety about 4 years ago. General stress induced anxiety and then it spiraled out of control. I convinced myself I had skin cancer and made my doctor check me all over. I am fine but was told to keep an eye on my moles. Ok. No changes in 4 years. Anxiety continued and I took medication for it. Since then I have returned to normality and no longer take meds. 

I have a smear test coming up soon and I don't know how I am going to cope between the test and the results. I know it is going to trigger my health anxiety and I do not know how I will function such as getting up and going to work. 4 years ago I was in such a bad place with my health anxiety I stayed in bed for weeks and was physically sick with worry. 

How can I cope while I wait for the results?",1.0673809523809543,3.2885662142857166,3.010714285714286,90.10095238095242,83.28571428571429,6.114285714285715,24.214285714285715,7.3871296695380915,1.1202357142857151,636,25,136,10,18,213,94,168,0.22,0.745,0.035,-0.983,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,2,8,6,0,1,6,1,14,8,2,10,1,34,28,18,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,1,6,0,1,0,3,14,0,3,4,0,1,5,4,3,0,0,7,2,23,3,24,20,2,27,0,1,1,0,1,9,0,0,12,94,26,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458188038761148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.530353953807556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115771237367037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15137548464123138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.146678736755681,0.11943911243214192,0.0,0.0,0.15551351226227986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14191939529296813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244157979578066,0.0,0.2364027077633505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2947678271717822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12324304551414812,0.0,0.0,0.228603690916236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13119883138557048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1540145858096849,0.13968045072061594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13585258278411433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14486509391108968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11469695184652565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14778791411410647,0.0,0.0,0.15882897670005838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042513978150257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13249091343800987,0.1540509451536707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11122077736218372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094258204365747,0.14081100945582525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678680626613437

Bad I know, but medication didn't work for me. So I've been drinking a fair amount most nights but decided it's definitely time to cut down. 

I have been worried about cutting down in case of fatal withdrawal symptoms, however I haven't had a drink since Friday night and I think I feel fine? Is it possible that I could just have been enjoying alcohol rather than be addicted? I would still like to drink once a week if I could.

healthanxiety,A_nicksNY,2019/02/11,"Just feel so overwhelmed over ultrasound. Pleas talk to me. Long story short is that i went to the DRs to get routine bloodwork done after stressing for a month, i also had her check my thyroid and hormones because after having irregular periods and feeling anxious i figured that hormones had to be it. My blood work came back fine except my testosterone was high. I started having a work up done on my ovaries and kidneys to check for tumors. My friend is a nurse at the office i was at and had the ultrasound tech check my kidneys extra well even tho it wasn’t a dedicated test for them because she knew i was afraid of a adrenal tumor. The tech couldn’t find anything and said if there was something there she would of seen it...but that wasn’t good enough of a answer for me. 

I have to go back for a kidney bladder ultrasound and I’m spiraling out of control because i feel like THATS when they’re going to find something. I can’t take it.

healthanxiety,abhinav_997,2019/02/11,"Scared of heart pumping problem My mom developed cardiomyopathy - inadequate pumping due to weakening of the heart muscle, when I was 8 or 9, I'm 21 now. 
Since then she's been on medicines and her condition has improved significantly in last 12 years. 
A few years ago I started having heart palpitations which were more noticeable after I did some exercise. I was af and my parents took me to the ER but they said it's just anxiety, but as my mom has this condition, I should get it checked out. 
We went to the cardiologist the next day who ran some tests like ECG, Echo and bloodwork and everything came out normal. 
After a few months I stopped noticing the symptoms, even while exercising. 
I still get palpitations when I'm going through a phase of anxiety but rarely otherwise. 

Out of curiosity, I surfed the internet about cardiomyopathy and came to know that a person has 50% chance of inheriting the faulty gene from their affected parent and I'm really scared now. 
The articles even mentioned that in some cases the first diagnosis comes to light when a family member dies suddenly, due to cardiac arrest. 
I'm really scared now, of developing this disease now or in the near future and I don't really know what I can do about it. 

I want to mention one more thing that my mom's heart pumping has come back to normal but she still takes the medicine because a condition is a condition, so the prognosis is good in her case.

healthanxiety,WiggleFriend,2019/02/11,"Hearing loss At what point do I talk to my doctor about not being able to hear well. I've noticed more and more struggling to hear. Last time I asked she said I just had fluid in my ear and said it would be fine. It's been 6 months since then and I've switched doctors because of her being dismissive on other things. (Rolling eyes, laughing at me etc.) 
I had the flu between then and now. And after the flu it seems like it had gotten a lot worse. And being in public with hearing issues is making my anxiety skyrocket. 

What really scares me even more is my mom had a tumor removed from her ear area that was causing hearing loss. 

What do I do? Can anyone comfort me? Is this a reason to go to the walk in or do i need to make a regular appointment? 

I would of talked to the doctor the 8th but I've had such horrible times with doctors I ended up cancelling because I was having such bad anxiety attacks. (I ordered pizza instead to calm myself, it didn't help) 

I'm not on any anxiety medication. Or anything but birth control.

healthanxiety,GeefyGoofer,2019/02/12,"High blood pressure spike Does anyone else have high blood pressure? I can never tell if my high blood pressure causes my anxiety attacks or the other way around. I guess it’s not possible to know. 

I just ate fast food for the first time in a while, which seemingly cause my blood pressure to spike. My heart rate was up as if I was on a brisk walk for an hour, despite just sitting and doing deep breathing exercises. It was probably just all of the excess sodium but I just couldn’t calm myself back down for anything. 

I know that digestion in general will cause a higher heart rate but when my head starts to feel hot and tight like a balloon I just have a hard time shaking the idea that something bad is about to happen.

Doing fine now, just thought I’d share in case anyone has a similar thing. “This too shall pass”

I have always had problems with my stomach, docs gastroscopied me in 2016 because I had nausea and heartburn almost 24/7. Biopsies and everything came back normal, never gotten colonoscopied though. In my mind these canker sores are a symptom of crohns disease and it must mean I have it. I just can't figure out any other explanation than that thanks to hypochondria. My stomach problems were pretty bad years ago and I thought I had colon cancer or something like that.

healthanxiety,butchaphrodite,2019/02/12,"Sore gland in neck for six days, feeling so down with this anxiety. Just need to vent. I've had this problem on and off for a while where it'll flare up for a few days and then go away for a while. I have no idea what triggers it. It's always the left side of my neck under my jaw. I'm assuming it's a lymph node, but I can't feel anything when I feel around in that area. But the pain is very localized to that one spot, when I press on it or turn my head it'll hurt right there. It also hurts when I swallow but not in a sore throat way, more like something is bumping against that inflammation and irritates it. 

I might go to the walk-in clinic today because I'm sick of worrying about it. I have no other symptoms besides a small headache between my eyebrows which started up about two days ago and has stayed pretty constant. It feels like a sinus headache but I don't have the other symptoms besides my typically slightly stuffy nose. 

Trying to stop obsessing over lymphoma since I know that causes painless nodes and swelling. I just hate that I'm having this for seemingly no reason. I'd feel BETTER if I had a cold because at least then I'd understand the pain came from that. 

God. I feel like I've had one thing after another for the past six months.

healthanxiety,jammytwat,2019/02/12,"Mid back pain anxiety About 3 months ago I woke up with a slight pain half way up my back in my spine and just off to the right of my spine. Felt like low grade stabbing pain.
Of course I immediately thought of the c word. Since then I have noticed the pain move around and change slightly. Now it is like an ache in my thoracic spine. I also get painful tight neck pain. And I still have ongoing low back pain with sciatica since about 18 months.
My physiotherapist says he doesn't think it is anything serious and to just train harder in the gym.
I have basically resigned myself to the fact that I am dying.
But on good days I think it is a vicious circle of stress and anxiety manifestation in my back.
Anyone else get these symptoms?

healthanxiety,Gee9828,2019/02/12,"Had a heart attack scare and now my anxiety is through the roof Hi! I posted this in r/anxiety as well but i thought id post here too, hope thats ok!


So on Friday night I was rushed to the emergency department because I was having severe chest pain to the point where I couldn't even talk, I was just crying. I didn't know what it could be and it didnt even cross my mind that it could be anything to do with my heart. The pain eased up after and hour and after around 6 hours when I finally got seen by a doctor the pain was non existent. 

I explained the issue to the doctor and he told me he wasn't really worried about me seeing as I'm an otherwise healthy 20 year old but he decided to run an ECG anyway. The ECG came back showing changes in my heart rhythm that mimicked that of a heart attack and so he decided to take some blood to check. After about  2 hours he came back to me telling me that the blood test came back negative and that I hadn't had a heart attack it was probably just a panic attack and that I could go home.

Now it's a few days later and my brain wont stop going over the experience. I keep thinking something is wrong or that the doctor missed something. I keep getting chest pain and shortness of breath but my family are insisting it's anxiety after the whole experience. I dont know what to do I don't feel like myself at all and I dont want to go anywhere or do anything which is the complete opposite of how i usually am, and I've completely lost my appitite. I don't know how to shake the fact that this wasn't an actual heart attack and that I'm actually okay. I just feel completely broken and terrified. 

I'm sorry if this is a lot, or this is the wrong place I just felt like I had to write it down and maybe get some advice about what to do to make everything seem better.

TL:DR - I had a heart attack scare and although results eventually came back saying I hadn't had a heart attack I can't stop thinking somethings terribly wrong.

healthanxiety,Zerra102,2019/02/12,"Weird vision Hey guys. I’ve had health anxiety for a while, but yesterday I’ve had a new experience which freaked me out. As I was getting ready for sleep, my vision suddenly changed. I was seeing colors  and felt as though i opened my eyes underwater. There were areas in my vision that were blurry, and had lines on them. I tried to close my eyes but nothing changed. I fell asleep eventually and woke up an hour later with a headache. Went back to sleep and in the morning everything was fine. However, I’m on the edge because i’m scared it will happen again. Did it ever happen to you? Is it cause of concern? Thank you. I’m really freaked out right now",2.0536544850498366,4.553157604651165,3.1880675526024373,88.61738372093029,81.48062015503876,6.4764119601328884,23.16777408637873,7.7094869923839395,1.189116943521595,517,18,104,9,14,166,85,129,0.103,0.78,0.117,0.4234,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,2,1,0,6,6,0,1,6,0,11,6,5,1,1,14,22,10,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,5,9,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,4,0,0,12,5,13,2,16,9,0,23,0,0,4,0,5,11,0,0,10,64,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424623927989032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14319631154142562,0.0,0.11352165109086368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19130541712759627,0.3940048652586672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16845209344598008,0.0,0.0,0.1673679355891801,0.18216477797931616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17880617985297195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972954073571815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18439303461742976,0.32935810250765385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19794954707862575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18339511374865053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17985824705648445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1786888852490399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11930115467536008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15903600045705787,0.0,0.0,0.18644472977612184,0.0,0.14839802428209972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3727210131407909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17145189561777374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18296611556095074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126435240917468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1726333828922476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,nbtnbt,2019/02/12,"can someone tell me its really difficult to get diabetes? Hey,

I have been very anxious about possibly having diabetes for a while now. I am a bit overweight and dont exercise often. My eyesight has been declining over the past years and my family has no history of diabetes. so there is nothing to be alarmed about. However i keep thinking i have it, every little sign makes me freak out. A few days ago I found some mold in my toilet and immediately assumed it was because of the glucose in my urine or something. 

Can someone please give me some positive assuration or facts about the odds of getting diabetes due to being overweight? I think if I get told that you dont just develop diabetes for no reason, my anxiety would decline a lot.

In the last 2+ years I have some white mucus with every stool. Sometimes barely noticeable, sometimes more. Of course I'm freaking out and think about IBD, cancer and the worst possible outcome. However I don't have any other symptoms. No abdominal pain, no blood. I even don't fit into IBS, those guys have much more troubles than me. If this is IBD or cancer I'm pretty sure I wouldn't feel well and would have more symptoms. I'm also one of those guys who afraid to be diagnosed thus I didn't visited a doctor yet.  
I had periods when I managed to convict myself that I'm fine and during that periods I have very small amounts of mucus. But a few days ago it become more noticeable, then I started to examine my poops and freaked out. Of course now I have more and more of it.

healthanxiety,annabroski,2019/02/12,"SO HAPPY I FOUND YOU ALL So i have been agorohobic and having panic attacks for 6 months now. I have SEVERE health anxiety and would LOVE TIPS.

So basically I have chest pains (not in the heart area. It's like far left under breast. Sharp pain sometimes) I've had ekgs and blood tests and physicals. I cannot get over the fact something is wrong. Everyday. I'm afraid if I throw up I'm going to die. So being nauseous is my biggest fear

I go to doctors every other week to get evaluated and I always get sent away. Sometimes I break down and just start to cry and say ""I can't die now. I'm so young. Please. I can't die. Help me. I don't want to die."" over and over again becuase my toe hurts.

I'm in therapy and working on it. It's ptsd from a year ago when a client (I am a CNA) I worked with closely felt a little sick and got out of the car and threw up and died as I did cpr and he bled all over me. Then 2 weeks later my grandma died. Then 2 weeks later two friends died of random heart attacks. Healthy 20 year Old college students with no history of drugs or alcohol. One was found on her bathroom floor and they found out she had an unknown genetic heart condition. The other was eating with his girlfriend and on the way home said he felt a little sick to pull over. He threw up and died of a heart attack there.

Basically I'm terrified I have a brain tumor and my physical symptoms of my panic attacks are severe. I can't speak. My throat closes and I gag. I get cold sweats and I can't even get up to pee or drink water. Every single tiny little ache or pain in my body I fixate on for the whole day and Google 50 symptoms a day. 

I take my spo2 10 times a day. Blood pressure 8 times a day and heart rate 15-30 times a day. I've never been diagnosed with any condition ever. I've never had high BP. My hr is 62.

I'm 22 and terrified daily I will die any second and I'm working SOOOO hard to not live like this. But it feels like a million things to work on at once and my health anxiety doesn't get addressed as much.

healthanxiety,IIIlIIIIIIIII,2019/02/12,"I was doing so well... But now, I’m writing this from the ER. I woke up this evening around 3am with some sharp stabbing pains in the back of my left knee. It lasted about 5-10 min, which was just long enough for me to convince myself it was something fatal.

I used to be in the hospital every other week, but I’d been doing well over the last 3-4 months and hadn’t been once, until tonight.

Every little thing doesn’t get me anymore, but I guess the “medium” sized ones still do :(",4.377433333333337,4.2382064100000045,4.834,90.09033333333336,69.9,7.066666666666667,24.66666666666667,5.46131890053228,0.4286666666666665,371,8,83,1,6,118,76,100,0.08199999999999999,0.875,0.043,-0.5927,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,0,10,5,0,0,5,0,11,2,1,1,0,11,16,6,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,7,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,1,7,1,8,3,13,8,2,18,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,2,11,59,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20466271404384573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837122696306384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15868511490591686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21323446694534914,0.0,0.1363048574735109,0.0,0.34774976852329903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10781934765006744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2273388519854044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3364367531057997,0.0,0.0,0.22422065275236924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20683607339412427,0.0,0.1826301771787388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16472186274042255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21977637768412173,0.13984105661454135,0.0,0.21959129382836529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588730308905009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16480664584254867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371024734417026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1782366601670483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1655368601034084,0.0,0.3711012457035477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,michalknejp,2019/02/12,"Anxiety or something serious? (MS worries) Hi, I’m here, again..

About one year ago I posted here about my MS worries.

So here is my short story (longer in previous post):

October 2017
- nausea, dizziness, 14 days headache around right temple and behind eye, fatique, weak legs, twitching all around my body (eyelids, around mouth the most, tinnitus, burning sensations (especially in right foot) etc..
Then I started googling which was the dumbest idea in my whole life..
November 2017
- sensation lost around left knee
- MRI of brain/spine (1,5T machine) (few very small and absolutely non specified white spots)
- SSEP, EEM, EEG, EYE exam, bloodworks for EVERYTHING (lyme, hiv, syphilis, ...) and EVERYTHING is okay..

Then the problems slowly went away, but sometimes I still have dizziness, nausea, eyepain, headaches, tinnitus for few seconds, burning and tingling sensations, weak legs..everything is on/off

January 2019
- follow up MRI of brain/spine (3T machine) and everything is same as previous MRI

More than 10 doctors told me its nothing serious (no MS!!)  and it can be psychosomatic..
BUT
Im still conviced it could be something serious.

What do u think?
Somebody with same problems?

Thanks!

healthanxiety,ziggybot12,2019/02/13,Worried about glaucoma I have been worried about this on and off for about 8 months now. I have always had bad vision and it keeps getting worse. I’ve had eye exams every year and nothing about glaucoma was ever mentioned except for once when I was maybe 14 and they said they wanted to keep an eye on it but by the next appointment my eye was  normal. The vision I my right eye has been getting worse and has just recently turned a bit red. I am 19 years old and studying to be a nurse but I cannot do that if I’m blind. Any thoughts about this? ,2.143008849557525,3.955506884955757,3.123194690265489,92.79735840707966,77.49557522123894,5.935929203539826,21.919469026548683,6.742157984588678,0.3854219469026554,430,12,93,4,10,137,73,113,0.135,0.8290000000000001,0.036000000000000004,-0.8807,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,2,0,9,1,0,0,5,0,15,7,4,0,1,17,24,10,0,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,5,6,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,9,7,10,0,14,14,1,13,0,0,6,0,4,4,0,1,9,62,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508491218506438,0.0,0.0,0.12328449468784247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15137090108557338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19792345692707194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16398861795052092,0.15274597957108407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18943474146320136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3222805815379253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18213176457640484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1447052136822559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1928056575660308,0.0,0.1776272616456371,0.17395416545836082,0.0,0.1902350221379336,0.1930696215183623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17900356920300595,0.0,0.0,0.15482202319851135,0.17244981287836728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14392526818046142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19719318550598672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693047405265783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682208097426156,0.3695032269799264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2334916739785393

healthanxiety,imaddictedtocoffee,2019/02/13,"Insomnia driving me crazy I always had sleep issues but it has been getting worse since December. I was on trazodone 100mg for a year, all of the sudden it stopped working. Tried increasing my dose, didn't help. I was put on ambien, made me do weird stuff. Next, I tried Lunesta but it didn't work. Melatonin doesn't work, zzzquil/benadryl doesn't work. 

It takes me forever to fall asleep and I wake up 2 hours later,  around the same time. Takes me a bit to fall back to sleep, just to wake up again. Last night I woke up around the same time but couldn't fall back to sleep. I'm worried something serious is causing my worsening insomnia, I read cancer causes insomnia and so can other diseases.

Now I'm scared I have some type of cancer or other serious disease. Makes me think this is why nothing seems to help me and why my trazodone stopped working. This is only going to make my insomnia worse..",2.8005614973262034,5.1280036818181856,3.4658288770053503,88.65403743315511,77.52272727272728,6.641176470588236,26.26203208556149,7.724431198458867,1.5462390374331545,712,28,139,11,17,224,103,176,0.237,0.763,0.0,-0.9918,0,0,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,5,8,4,0,1,5,0,16,13,6,5,1,24,28,8,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,9,5,0,2,2,1,0,7,5,4,0,0,8,0,18,0,17,19,6,29,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,3,15,82,27,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004973085484077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21407908047294885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849150497792196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312714873807448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24704023693340765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06282070013213256,0.0,0.06833544886188232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16118934934954324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11841267496016028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12549984578520615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09801205832223628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11377447133806436,0.1605229390197871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12787713915810012,0.11283756685530245,0.0,0.11537400564001468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09144832086105964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12087491627710135,0.0,0.0,0.12027304189952648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12038171974021462,0.0,0.0,0.10946243811545396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09946418670510428,0.0,0.3609820180952355,0.0,0.0,0.0925670137148984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20105288922947745,0.0,0.0,0.1376466087746122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1808117884495623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07704525929528076,0.0,0.0,0.14022640862593272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1632708176379084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2169967036889343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4376825916141287,0.1221100675228856,0.24507069020885386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743094176421082

It turns out that I had an incidental finding which was “benign brain calcification”. She said it is unremarkable and the rest was deemed “normal”. 

I had another CT a year later, and the size was unchanged. So that could indicate I’ve just had it my whole life and means nothing, and they pushed the next CT to 5 years away (which would be next year or the year after). They did say that if I’m having symptoms such as a headache (they gave no other symptoms), that we can schedule it sooner. 

I’m just terrified that it’s multiplying in my brain right now or something. I have terrible health anxiety and get horrible symptoms, especially with vision. I’m just nervous that it’s the calcification causing this and not my anxiety. 

Has anyone else had experience with this? Or any doctors that can give me some reassurance? I know I should just make an appointment with the neurologist, but she already thinks I’m crazy and told me to see a psychologist about my anxiety (which I do) lol. 

Thanks on advance!

healthanxiety,Earth_Mender,2019/02/13,"Stomach worries I've always suspected I had IBS but my symptoms wouldn't flare up enough for me to really consider it. Last week I was getting pregnancy scares because my stomach felt like it was moving. I quickly took a test and it was negative. 
Then a couple days after I got a sore throat and stomach ache and sinus congestion. This has set me off big time, worst I have had it since 2015. My stomach aches after eating anything and I'm not popping that much. My tummy feels like I've done a hundred sit ups and I don't know whether it's my anxiety manifesting into physical feelings or my stomach is telling me something serious is up. 
This is really starting to get to me and I'm so petrified of the the doctors, the thought that I should just go and get some reassurance is scaring me too. I comfort ate last night and that set my stomach off obviously.

healthanxiety,swedishbanana1,2019/02/13,"Worried I could have contracted HIV at work I am a nurse who works in a doctor's office where we perform minor outpatient procedures for skin conditions. I was injecting a patient with local anesthetic (lidocaine) on the back. While injecting the lidocaine, all of the sudden a stream of liquid started squirting out of the cyst I was injecting, but only while I was injecting the anesthetic. It was clear liquid. It happened to squirt right on my mouth and lips. I was not wearing a mask at this point. I immediately wiped the area, and then went and told the physician who I work with, as I didn't know if it was just anesthetic that has come out, or was whatever the cyst was consisting of. He stated that he would be able to tell as soon as he got in there to remove it. He injected more anesthetic and he same stream of liquid came out of the same location. He assumed it was likely lidocaine (the medicine) coming out of a pore. 

I was surprisingly fine right after it happened, but now I am so concerned about any exposure to blood borne pathogens (hep c and hiv, as I am vaccinated against hep b). I am not sure if I was exposed to blood, as it was only whatever liquid it was that splashed onto my mouth. I am concerned because my lips were dry and slightly cracked, and I had a small (very small) cut as well. Being a medical professional myself, I understand how those diseases are spread, and I don't want to be unreasonable in my worry. There is just a part of me that wonders if there was blood mixed in with the fluid, as I was injecting anesthetic with a needle and there was some small amount of blood on his skin from previous pokes with the needle, and that the cracks/cut on my lips could have been exposed to any virus. The physician stated he would be glad to have the patient and myself tested if I am concerned, but he does not seem too concerned himself. I know there is also no difference in testing the patient at this point or waiting to get tested myself in a few weeks, as the outcome would be the same. I am simply wanting to hear if anyone has any thoughts and wanted to vent. 

As far as I know, the patient was healthy and not HIV or hep c +, though there is no way to be sure without a test. This is my first real exposure to any ""body fluids"" in my career, so I am very curious what others think or to get any advice on how to calm my mind. 

I am already planning to get myself tested in a few weeks once the typical ""window period"" of infection has passed. I know having the patient tested would be the easiest way for me to get quick results (and relief from anxiety) but I do not want to offend the patient, either. I am getting sick with worry! 

Thank you in advance to anyone who responds. I appreciate you listening.

healthanxiety,slambarz,2019/02/14,"3 weeks of crazy medical symptoms and scared out of my mind Not sure where to even start. 

Around Christmas time I was drinking pretty heavily and abusing phenibut pretty bad. Once I returned back to work I slowly tapered everything down, but still had lingering vertigo and dizziness. I went to the occupational nurse and explained this to her so she sent me to the ER after seeing my blood pressure through the roof. 

EKG, chest x-ray and blood work all came back okay. Blood pressure a little on the high side but no big deal. 

A few days goes by and I'm noticing my eye is driving me nuts, like it's super dry and irritated. I keep checking it and it looks fine. Check it again and I notice my eyebrow is hanging lower than normal so I panic because I'm thinking stroke and go to the ER. Get halfway there and get this rush of a weird taste in my mouth and I suddenly feel super weak and out of it. My head feels like it's expanding and I can't string a sentence together and my neck and shoulder muscles feel like they're all as tense as they possibly can be. Ambulance takes me to the ER, get EKG, chest x-ray and blood work and they give me a xanax and send me home saying it was a panic attack. 

Next time I'm in the ER it's the same thing. I start noticing my neck muscles are super tense and my heart is pounding and I try to keep calm for as long as possible, but it doesn't go away so I go to the ER again. CT scan, blood work and a small dose of ativan and I'm fine. 

Third time I convince myself sudden proptosis. PANIC. Go to the ER again, same symptoms. My head feels like it's rushing with fluid, neck muscles are insanely tense and I'm freaking out. Checks my eye pressure and gives a quick exam and I'm fine. 

Go see my regular doc and I keep explaining to him it's not anxiety. Never had attacks like these in my life. Did the usual neurological tests when I explained fear of a stroke and it was all fine. He asked me to smile. Asked me to really smile. Explained to him my left arm had been feeling a little weaker than normal and my armpit felt almost numb or inflamed. So he ordered an MRI because he said it felt colder than the other. 

Came home and checked my smile in the mirror and noticed the right side of my face is pretty much paralyzed. I can barely smile, but I can close my eye. My eyebrow hangs lower than the left and my cheek sags a little. I called the ER doc and she said it's probably Bell's Palsy. Probably a ~3 week timeframe. 

So I'm terrified I have a tumor or MS or something. I did have a CT scan that came back clean. The only symptom I still have is the drooping on my face. I keep thinking my left arm feels weak, but I'm not even really sure. It's like the more I focus on it the worst it gets, but otherwise I don't really notice it. Maybe it feels mildly colder. 

Right now my balance is fine. I find my self falling asleep for a few seconds at a time randomly when I'm at my desk, but I sleep like shit because of anxiety. When I'm sitting down I get these weird feelings like someone's walking up the stairs, like you can feel it in your butt from the vibrations, but nothing's actually happening. My vision has been blurry for the past two years, but my eye doctor said it's nothing to be concerned about. 

I don't even know. My doctor is out until the beginning of March and all I want are my MRI results so I know what's going on. Are these panic attacks, is this just bell's palsy brought on my all of the stress of the past three weeks?

I'm fucking terrified. Sorry for the rant.

healthanxiety,neosharks,2019/02/14,"Should I see a neurologist? Worried about Brain Tumor? Hey everyone,

I've been a bit worried about having a brain tumor in the past few days. Had some small headaches two weeks ago, usually when I had shitty sleep. Had some more bad headaches this past weekend, though I had shitty sleep. They came in the morning and then in the evening. Took some Ibuprofen and it went away, but kinda came in a dull ache when I was starting at the computer screen about two hours later.

Ever since Monday, I have not had the headaches except sometimes in the morning when it is a dull kind of feeling, not really a pain. I dont wake up with them but then I start thinking about the headache and felt stressed and then it came on. Goes away after two hours and it hasnt come up again the past few days. I had one today and I took a tynelol and the pain went away after an hour. Also haven't had nausea, unless I had pizza pops or greasy food. No Seizures, though yesterday as I was sleeping, my right leg moved a bit but that was it. I dont know if thats a seizure.

Not any cognitive problems. My speech and personality are fine but I have been on edge as I have been thinking and reading about Brain Tumors. Recently, with my memory, I am able to recall stuff fine but when I remind myself to do something after, I kept repeating to myself what I have to do because I read about someone who was worried he had a brain tumor and he kept forgetting stuff after 20 seconds. After this, I am worried I might be forgetting things. I did a memory recall test where I got over 84% in recalling images. Im not forgetting questions or anything of the sort, but I have been on edge recently. I am 21. 

I do have a cold, and had some pressure in my ears and nose that have gone away, but I am going to see the doctor. Do you think I should see a neurologist?  What I am worried about is the headaches in the morning? They were bad this weekend, but got better and have not been painful.

Generally, I found the headaches occured when I had bad sleep. I've been sleeping quite late, like at 2:30-2:50 and waking up at 9 or 10. I do move a lot when I sleep so I probably sleep past that.

healthanxiety,TheCurseofCuriosity,2019/02/14,"I choked on a grape and now I'm worried that it got into my lungs, does this sound possible? As stupid as this sounds, my anxiety is telling me that since I was eating a grape and laughed and coughed a bit, I inhaled the juice and my lungs are going to react. Should I worry?  

The long version is: I laughed while eating a grape and it caused me to cough, it was more coughing than I'm used to and it burned a bit, so I was worried that I didn't cough it out well enough. I'm feeling a little tired now (6hrs later) and short of breath and my mucus is that sickly yellow. I felt immediate pain an hour after it happened but I don't feel it anymore, but most of these might be health anxiety. I haven't coughed since it happened, which should tell me that nothing is wrong but I'm worried nonetheless. I spend most of my time worrying about this sort of thing and I realise it's bordering impossible to have it happen but I can't stop worrying.

healthanxiety,garfbooks,2019/02/14,"Sternum Popping and Pain I'm a 31/M. For the past 2-3 weeks my sternum has been audibly popping. Like my wife heard it the other night when we were eating dinner. At first there was no discomfort, but over the past few days pressure builds in the center of my chest causing discomfort. Then my sternum pops and the pain goes away, only to return minutes later.

I went to the Dr yesterday and got an x-ray and and ECG which she said looked slightly abnormal compared to an ECG I had in 2014. She is sending me to a cardiologist. I don't know my x-ray results yet. My appointment with the cardiologist is Feb 25th. Seems so far away, and I keep thinking, what if I have a heart attack between now and then? I know it's not going to happen, but the fear keeps trying to creep in. The pain isn't terrible or dibilitating, but its enough to cause me anxiety.  Im trying not to let it get the best of me but it's hard.

There was a skinny feral cat in my yard this evening. I have not seen him before. It was clear he was neutered a while ago. I happened to have just bought canned cat food and was bringing it inside when I saw him licking/biting a paper plate I had left out earlier that day to feed another feral cat. I opened a can of cat food and dumped it out. The offending cat was ravenous and ate a whole can in less than one minute. I fed him another can and he scarfed about half of it. Then he was happy and let me pet him. Afterward, he started cleaning himself. I began walking through my yard and he started to follow me. Then out of no where, he scratched and bit my leg through my work pants. It wasn’t super hard but when I came inside, I see it slightly broke my skin. I washed it with soap and water but now I’m worried about rabies exposure. I’ve attached a picture of the scratch/bite. Any input would be greatly appreciated as I don’t know I’m being anxious over nothing or if there is a real health  threat here.

healthanxiety,The_Music,2019/02/15,"I got innocently bit by a feral kitten trapped in my house, now I'm dying of course. Two feral kittens were eating food my family put out for them and our cat scared them, so they ran inside the house. In the process of trying to literally herd cats, one of them bit my knuckle while I tried fishing him out of the corner. I washed it with alcohol and soap for 10 minutes.

After doing some Googling (!!!) I went to the ER two days later. I must have rabies!

After explaining the situation, the nurses and doctor were very reassuring that I probably didn't need a rabies vaccine. They said it was ultimately up to me, but she said ""in my professional opinion, I wouldn't get it."" As it was expensive and insurance might not cover it.

So I got a tetanus shot and antibiotics instead.

Tetanus shot made me feel like trash and now I've had a the subtlest, mildest of headaches for three days. It's so light I'm not even certain I have one half the time. I'm hyper aware of every muscle twitch I have. When my hands get cold I panic thinking they're going numb. I check to make sure I can still swallow.

Any day now the headache will get intense and I'll wake up to my hand being completely numb. Then I'll go back to the ER and they'll tell me there's nothing they can do because I'm dead meat. 

It happened on the 9th and all of the feral cats appear fine still. Mom and dad cat and three kittens. None rabid or dying.

But I'm still dying. And constantly on alert about my body. Does my head hurt or am I making it hurt by thinking about it so damn much?

To make it worse, I got taken off my Ativan ages ago because I switched doctors and the new one refuses to prescribe anything remotely addictive.

healthanxiety,lottehamilton,2019/02/15,"Heart attack scare - here’s what it actually was... I have GAD and I’m especially plagued by health anxiety. 

2 weeks ago I was spinning out, chest pains, shortness of breath, pains in arms you get the gist. I’m sure you all understand the downward spiral of HA.

The weekend prior to that I went to an event and had purchased a new bra, turns out it was a wee bit ill fitting and I was uncomfortable in it but didn’t think much of it.

Turns out ill fitting bras can mimic heart attack pains and my shoulders and arms hurt because the straps were too tight.

healthanxiety,Megsi99,2019/02/15,"Left arm &amp; leg pain Hi all, last night my left arm &amp; leg started aching and felt tingly. I fell asleep okay, but it started back up this morning. I’m trying not to be anxious about it, but I definitely am. 😔

I’ve had a tight neck the last few days, so I’m wondering if that has anything to do with this. Or maybe a vitamin deficiency? IDK but it’s stressing me out and if it keeps up I’ll probably head to doctor next week. Just hoping I’m able to keep a straight head and avoid the ER this weekend. Ughhhhh.

healthanxiety,papaverliev,2019/02/15,"One time I thought I had lupus But instead I was diagnosed with tender breasts due to being a woman.

At the urgent clinic no less, accompanied by my aunt who drove me there, at late af o'clock.

At the time I had a sobbing meltdown in the parking lot. Not only did I still not know how I was dying, but I felt humiliated by having a sweet old nurse tell me, at 22 years old, that the achy lumps were tits not lymph nodes.

Now though, it's kind of hilarious. And laughing at the ridiculous shit my brain comes up with is so cathartic.

healthanxiety,Shionoro,2019/02/15,"actual problems mixed with anxiety I have one legitimate issue that i will get an appointment for on monday (sadly, the weekend is inbetween).  
My BPM, which usually is around 55-65, got higher and flip flops around a lot (it is between 80 and 100 now when i am sitting or lying down) and my bloodpressure similarly got a tad higher (not to worrying heights, it is below 140) and, what is worrying me, flip flops around a lot when i take several measurements (like going from 100 to 130 and back several times when i do not move and measure 10 times over the course of some minutes, even when i am sitting still and relaxed).

This is an issue i legitimately think might have to do with my thyroids (no cancer fears about the thyroids, i think it might just be hyperactive and that makes sense because i am celiac and celiacs often have other autoimmune diseases, most commonly thyroid stuff).

Now to what actually makes me scared and is probably nothing:

Today, after a long time of it not happening (happened a lot before my celiac diagnosis), my whole body vibrated with my pulse (i could feel it everywhere, most importantly neck), my pulse was actually off (too high, above 100 even when sitting, sometimes going as far as near 120) and i felt pressure in my gutts and chest. The pressure was so bad that, depending on how i moved, it felt like organs press on organs and i felt sick.

My neck was not only vibrating with my pulse, it also got very tensed (not some kind of stiffness that made it unable to move, but i felt like someone grabbed me just at the start of the back of my head and pressed his finger into it, shutting down the blood flow except for the very strong pulsations).

I had these symptoms before (more or less) as i said, and I assume that it is Roemheld syndrome (a benign, but very scary kind of thing) because i know that my heart is fine. It got very thoroughly checked back then and it was fine in the months before, i could do sports, i am not feeling weak, i am not having syncopes).

Roemheld syndrome means that you got so much pressure in your gutts due to air and food that it presses against your heart, chest and lungs so you experience very scary sensations, similar to angina pectoris, but it is not actually dangerous. Your heart rate is increased, your chest feels tight, you might have shortness of breath, but you are going to be fine once the pressure is gone. But that can take a long time and in that time you think you will die and you need to go to the ER.

I had that today, the first time in almost a year and i was kinda broken that it came back. I thought i beat it, and then suddenly here i am, thinking i got a lung emboli, or my veins are shut down, or there is a tumor pressing on my heart or veins. Or i got a brain aneurysm because i also felt pulsations in my head and heard noises in my air (i dont think these are noises it usually makes when you got very high bp, since my bp is not actually that high and it was only one air AND i got a head MRT the year before and it was fine).  


Now, i am very sure that roemheld is what caused this, because yesterday i drank a lot of booze and cola while eating and i had a bit of pressure before that to begin with, but the reason that i am still like 'ya, gonna die' is that i lost so much weight compared to last time.  
I lost more than 10 kilo so there should be far more space for my innards. I am not overweight anymore.

So, what my anxiety brain thinks is this: Back then, a tumor right behind my sternum, pressing on my heart. Ofc the pressure got better when i lost weight and stuff, but now it grew enough to make up for it and it presses again against my heart and no doctor will check for that (obviously the tumor is not visible via sono but NEEDS MRT or CT) and at some point it will just destroy my heart and I will die. Or my neck or bones presses on important veins and i will also die because the vein will burst (even tho i had an mrt of the neck (for legit reasons) just 2 months ago and while my neck had issues, noone said anything about veins).

&amp;#x200B;

I am fine now because i drank a lot of herbal tea that helps with roemheld, but i am still here thinking about tumors and also thyroid cancer.

As a bonus point, i think about it even being my own fault because i might have ingested gluten accidently (i probably didnt, but i live, for some time, with a non celiac so there is some chance there was contamination of my food, but he is careful and i am too, so it aint probable) and the gluten made the belly angry.

I really hope this was a one time thing and i am not falling back into anxiety due to roemheld, i will be extra careful about food in the next days.  


I will not eat today until the belly died down (and sadly my eating choice are limited due to celiac in any case, not a lot of good 'get healthy' food, at least not in my flat) and drink very much of the herbal tea.

&amp;#x200B;

When i feel better, i will do some sit ups and push ops to try to straighten out my belly and i will massage my neck as much as i can.

So far i am at least not predialing the medics anymore.

healthanxiety,EliJan3,2019/02/15,"Scared I have lymphoma I have extreme anxiety and this has been almost crippling. 
I have 5 abnormal lymph nodes in my neck that are all over 1 cm in size. I’m getting a biopsy today for them and I’ve never been more scared in my life. 
I don’t have really any other symptoms other than it’s sore in the area, headaches, stuffy nose, and sometimes it’s harder to swallow since my neck is so sore. 
I’ve had the swollen lymph nodes for a month now with them gradually getting bigger. They can move around to the touch. 
I had blood work done 3 weeks ago and it came back normal. But I’m still afraid I have cancer. 
I don’t know how to stop assuming the worse. I can’t stop looking things up with the only results being lymphoma.

healthanxiety,RealGustyy,2019/02/15,"Brain tumor anxiety Hey everyone, I'm new to this subreddit. I feel like recently I've been suffering from health anxiety. It suddenly came up out of nowhere. First I was convinced something was wrong with my heart, I started having lots of different symptoms and was truly convinced something was wrong. Got it all checked, and it turned out fine. Afterwards I still felt kinda sick, so I got a blood test done which came back clear. This was about 3 weeks ago. 

A bit later I started having these headaches, and my vision suddenly got worse (at least I got the impression). Now I don't know if this is purely because I started focusing on it, or that it actually is something bad. Anyway, I decided to go back to the doctor since I work in IT, and dealing with the vision thing and headaches was getting pretty hard.

&amp;#x200B;

He checked me, asked lots of different things but he didn't seem quite sure about what it was. He sent me to an eye doctor, got my eyes checked there, and it turned out I need resting glasses for screen work ETC. (My eyes have been bad my entire life, had glasses since I was 3). I've also been having this visual snow, again I think I've had this for a long time, but it's like my mind suddenly seems to notice and freak out about it, same with things like my tinnitus which I've also had for years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still just scared I may have a brain tumor, because of the bad vision and headaches. But, if I had a brain tumor, they would have seen it in the blood test from a few weeks back, right? Or no? The doctor or eye doctor would have rang the alarm bell if something was seriously wrong, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think I'm fine? It's just so horrible to deal with this, it truly affected my life lately.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully my ultrasound looked normal, so I wasn't as worried anymore. Then, I was dealing with an upper respiratory infection and my symptoms lingered for so long that I thought I had strep--which, thankfully, I didn't. But I've been experiencing so many more stomach pains these past few weeks and last night I was awake for what felt like the worst acid reflux I've ever had!!! I'm still feeling it today :( I don't know if it's GERD, an ulcer, or could even be side effects from the birth control I'm using... but of course I think it's a million different horrible issues...",5.245519061583579,6.605155135483872,6.1209384164222875,76.27595307917889,68.61290322580646,8.733137829912026,30.865102639296193,9.095868883498916,2.686354838709677,646,26,117,12,11,213,101,155,0.128,0.8009999999999999,0.07200000000000001,-0.8541,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,3,8,7,0,0,8,3,15,6,1,3,1,22,28,12,0,3,4,0,2,1,0,0,5,0,0,0,8,5,0,1,7,0,0,0,3,3,0,2,12,7,14,4,12,13,4,17,0,0,1,0,1,3,0,4,15,78,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16394592037617906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10077317533295004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18541241139880546,0.13198885431710528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17043028331642046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17271673694996628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918757436907263,0.1495349317501288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08358714102897141,0.0,0.15872625476981558,0.0,0.0,0.14061502066870465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17254365952598497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085161576605397,0.13475203188326487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08076350531123963,0.0,0.0,0.14629666486108694,0.13882115386858696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.167601276953936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2639022698318338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15513490550852066,0.16197148789409774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35180904290729426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15780981515012493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15049460447467328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13201905077335754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17182334208862873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30439571257516873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10592579540446898,0.0,0.1312399325237189,0.0,0.0,0.1566972466023384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14277721974117286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326039919514698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33576643514644783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ImaginaryRecording2,2019/02/16,"Upper Neck/ Spine Pain Anxiety So I've been diagnosed with GAD and I'm a senior in college so I've had unbelievably high stress and anxiety levels lately because of my impending graduation and uncertain future. Within the past few weeks I've developed this disturbing new symptom where whenever I start to feel anxious or stressed I get this weird pressure feeling in my neck, almost as if it is in my spine and someone is squeezing it. From there, my panic takes over and my heart begins to race, my stomach hurts and I feel nauseous, I get a tension headache, and I feel all wound up and ready to flee. My upper neck and shoulder muscles have been incredibly tight lately, so rationally I'm sure this spinal feeling is just a result of muscle tension and anxiety, as well as the crappy dorm mattress and my poor posture. However, I've convinced myself I have a brain tumor or am going to develop epilepsy or something. Dr. Google certainly didn't help because I Googled symptoms of a brain tumor and guess what, I have most of them! I just don't know what to do to calm myself down, I feel like I'm spiraling out of control.

healthanxiety,mjokeefe91,2019/02/16,"Fears of ALS or other Motor Neuron Disease. Please help! M. 27 years. Type Two Diabetic - diet and medication controlled. History of chronic back pain, around T6-T7 vertebrae, unilateral up until a few months ago, now bilateral.

For a few weeks I've had a light flickering that alternates in each eye. This is accompanied with occasional twitching, particularly in my right tricep, forearm and occasionally my hand. These occur any where between once and three to four times a day, and while strong are often brief.

I am pretty sure that the symptoms started after a pulled muscle in the right side of my neck. I had some stiffness for a few hours one morning, before I turned my head suddenly, causing a shooting pain up that side of my neck and within a short time, a massive headache, (lasting about a day) followed by an inability to move my head properly for a few days.

Smaller twitches occur up and down my legs, though I feel that may have to do with acute sensitivity due to how much anxiety this is causing me. And I have had a lot of lower back, hip and left leg pain that has come and gone for the last five or so years.

Other symptoms that occur include pain and weakness in my pinky, shoulder and inner forearm that come and go. These symptoms are exacerbated when I am seated, at work and are particularly intense when I am at work, using a mouse, keyboard, or when my arm is crooked at an awkward angle for too long, such as using my phone.

Logic tells me that all of this is caused by a combination environmental factors and anxiety, given that about 8 months ago, I made the transition from a standing job (various retail positions for about 8 years), to a desk job, and I've NEVER had great posture. 

My physio is confident that all of this is caused by compression of the Cervical spine, where he says there is obvious stiffness between the joints in some parts, particularly at the base of the skull. He also says the spindle especially likes to compensate, so pain in one area untreated can eventually lead to difficulties along the whole spine, and that after ten years of untreated pain, he isnt surprised by my symptoms. He and my GP suggest seeing a neurologist, but only if my symptoms persist. 

Sorry for the long post. This has really allowed me to catalogue and rationalise my thoughts. In all honesty, I am feeling as though this may be anxiety. An abnormal ultrasound showed possible cancer of the testicle this time last year, and I've been spiraling ever since... I also knew it was a bad idea to read Stephen Hawkings posthumous novel at a time I wa already so anxious, but alas, I did, and have suddenly started experiencing the twitching. 

Thanks for being there redditors.

healthanxiety,swiz101,2019/02/16,"Heart palpitations gone crazy :-( I am freaking out right now, I’m due to take a flight tomorrow and I’m so scared I’ll drop down mid flight. I’ve had the worst week stress wise (had to have scans for blood clots as I got rushes to hospital with chest pain). The stupid thing is I literally had scans, ECGs and blood works days ago.... yet I’m freaking out. Since last night I’ve been having bad palpitations and ectopic beats (I do suffer with this) and I just want them to go away. They’re happening loads! Like multiple times in the hour and although they’re not that severe I just have had enough. Can someone just tell me this is just stress and anxiety from the week? Does anyone else get a big increase in these after or during stress?

healthanxiety,blushingboobies,2019/02/16,"Racing heart rate after trip to ER for allergic reaction scare I went to the ER last night around 11pm for trouble breathing after eating something new. I do have food allergies but this item did not say it contained any of them. They treated me with an anti-nausea medicine, a bendryl and a steroid and sent me home. I ate some dinner and went to bed. I woke up about an hour ago to get ready to go somewhere and my heart was racing in the 140s, just from standing up. Sitting is 120s. I took some deep breaths and got it in the high 90s but if I stand up it shoots up again. It feels racing in my chest as well. Is this anxiety? Is this something from the steroids they gave me? I am freaking out right now.  Should I go back to the ER?

healthanxiety,uaenerie,2019/02/17,"Stomach pains So last month, I was really stressed because of college. I ate avocados the same day and got a stomach ache later. Today, I got stressed again and ate avocados and got a stomach ache later in the day again. It was just very sharp abdominal pain that lasted for an hour and then subdued when I laid on my right side. The thing is, I don’t know if it’s stress, avocados, or something more serious causing this. It’s absolutely not bowel related because I didn’t need to use the bathroom. If it’s avocados, that would be strange because I ate them for the past week but I was fine other than these two occasions. I’m scared to see a doctor because I don’t want to freak out my mom. Is there anyone with insight on what this might be? I’m still very young but last month my grandma had abdominal pain and found out it was colon cancer so I’m panicking and I’m dreading to see the doctor.",3.1050460405156537,4.844305729281772,4.566828729281768,83.81274769797423,74.58011049723756,7.478600368324125,28.08876611418048,8.238735603445708,1.9019389318600384,711,29,144,12,15,237,103,181,0.23,0.75,0.019,-0.9898,1,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,0,8,11,0,5,10,0,14,14,5,2,0,26,31,15,0,5,7,1,1,0,0,2,6,0,0,0,13,9,3,0,3,0,0,0,4,10,0,1,13,3,13,1,14,14,2,26,0,0,2,0,2,7,0,4,19,88,26,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403480276198813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29304995619651897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12346112739438216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1550162860458134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24602494652149315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13177454210071338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2883641600137186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118356123114525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06604947678948386,0.29389574837484705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12749525373055404,0.0,0.14075696879908278,0.19185797301430751,0.0,0.0,0.08911422974520677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3836498066309261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11472834726188205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699235743987103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263569222206552,0.0,0.0,0.12032422751284667,0.0,0.19154070654201066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09252280531007784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095978361598745,0.0,0.4130079305019928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07984429696264589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139195056154884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174014042411772,0.0,0.0,0.10379959213543474,0.0,0.19832725241988827,0.07088709343344687,0.0,0.096403616102379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537461062252087,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,BrandonJamesSon,2019/02/17,"Self diagnosis past 4 months I thought I would just list all the diseases/problems I've convinced myself I've had the past few months. Multiple trips to the Dr, multiple blood tests - everything coming back clear. 

Diabetes, HIV, throat/tongue/mouth cancer, MS, lupus, overactive thyroid and sjogrens syndrome. 

Yup, it's been a tough few months, I've lost so much sleep thinking about how I'm going to tell my friends and family, will I have to move back home to die? But I'm so young, this is so unfair? 

I'm still struggling, but for the past week I've stopped googling and honestly, it has helped. I still get the thoughts and worries, but by not googling they do not manifest in my mind as much. 

My doctor has diagnosed me with something though, and that something is anxiety. I think it's important to remember that anxiety does have LOADS of physical symptoms (over 100!) and can affect people in different ways. A website I find useful (I know, no googling but this is different, right) is; https://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms.shtml 

I've been lurking on this sub for the past month or so, and can really relate to posts here on a daily basis. It's somewhat comforting to know you're not alone with these crazy thoughts. 

If anyone is struggling and wants someone to talk to, my DMs are open 😁 have a great week everybody.

healthanxiety,pil-cou,2019/02/17,"Can't stop coughing! Hey everyone, I'm new to this subreddit but was wondering if anyone else has gone through this and had any advice. For about a year now (maybe longer?) I've had a dry cough. Like, I cough like crazy every day. When I go to the doctor, they say everything sounds fine, no liquid or anything. I even had them test me for asthma, and my breathing tests came back normal. At this point I'm pretty sure my coughing is just a nervous tick that stems from my health anxiety... which is pretty severe. I do get acid reflux and I have bad seasonal allergies, but neither of those things caused my cough before a year or so ago. I guess I'm kind of obsessed with making sure my lungs are clear, especially if water or something accidentally goes down the wrong pipe. When that happens, I cough nonstop, to the point where it hurts. Aside from being annoying and embarrassing, I find that I've been getting a lot more chest pain from time to time, and my throat hurts. So, does anyone else do this? Do you have an advice on stopping? I just really want to stop.

healthanxiety,EagonLoch,2019/02/17,"If I had headaches that came on, but have now dissapeared, should I not be worried? Hi everyone,

I had headaches last weekend that lasted for a few days. They were pretty bad, around the forehead area and came on in the mornings and evenings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. They pretty much went away from like Monday to Thursday, except for a dull feeling, but now that is gone as well. So should I be worried of something such as a brain tumor? I was diagnosed with an ear infection but I am taking antibiotics. 

I haven't really had any other issues. I have been stressed about my short term memory, but I am able to recall stuff well but I sometimes forgot about tasks I need to do. I do have ADHD so I believe this is the cause, but I tend to remember the tasks. I also have some moments where I am zoning out because I am thinking so much, but this only happens when I am in front of a computer and I am usually able to recognize that I am not paying attention and snap out of it, so I dont believe I am having seizures.",3.1098529411764697,4.878296946078431,4.418431372549018,84.7579411764706,74.63725490196079,7.349019607843138,27.196078431372552,8.124751697461798,1.818801960784313,803,31,157,13,17,265,117,204,0.073,0.809,0.118,0.7978,0,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,2,0,16,6,0,1,9,0,29,5,3,1,0,32,40,21,0,4,11,0,1,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,9,11,0,1,4,1,1,5,4,3,2,0,11,2,25,3,26,25,5,31,0,1,0,0,3,12,0,2,15,130,34,2,0.2701262289609762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16231961686460974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080099238530871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09184754935827616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12023480693076405,0.0,0.0,0.12689624206027075,0.0,0.1127720590011468,0.0823332209768002,0.0,0.0,0.3043397577362748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507751038140258,0.0,0.30895244348286016,0.0,0.1387470234186275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710453534723599,0.0,0.0,0.13708621814147068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15829296427354372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08920791330379223,0.0,0.0,0.12905859388872046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682919688738541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194358660823102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14097080101884718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22018892987070648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598501543373576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19857385940857772,0.10014758800877246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10272158473944336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2748154869855972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08652488962490397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15300017972575666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039781841138332,0.13358087377609754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15471434130676925,0.0,0.15461495251313134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015506532773357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08654299014956092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1487529390271711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2428759206918576,0.12520486026285335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743262977490586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,TwistyTurret,2019/02/17,"Found a new app that helps me I found a new app that is helping me keep track of my health fears and then go back later and see if they were real or imagined. I can see my track record of “predicting” so I can tell myself “this fear has been wrong the last 6 times so it’s probably wrong now.” I can also list evidence for or against my fear so I can see proof that my fear is probably unfounded.

healthanxiety,qwertyified,2019/02/17,"I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit, now if that helps you with your anxiety that's cool, however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place. So I honestly do believe we should move more away from ""I have x,y,z symptoms am I going to die?"" to ""How can I find peace of mind and stop googling"" 


One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of [Hey Arnold](https://www.wco.tv/hey-arnold-season-2-episode-5-monkey-business-2) which is my all time favourite show (it's only the first episode in the video provided called 'monkey business' btw), I won't ruin it for you all, but it's really funny and will hit home for all of us, it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms. Hopefully it can help you all in your journey in controlling your hypochondria like it has done for me.

healthanxiety,cratanoia,2019/02/17,"Please help; Orthorexia, health anxiety, veganism and internet quacks Hi there, 

&amp;#x200B;

I experience health anxiety and orthorexia, I have a really unhealthy relationship with food and my health anxiety revolves extremely around food. However, I have spent so much money on tests and seeing doctos and am at my wits end. Every health test I have had through a legitimate NHS doctor, gastroenterologist and specialist I have been told I have nothing to stress about. I had a blood test for pernicious anemia, a full blood count test for everything, a stool test through the gastroenterologist. My worry now is that I have SIBO or some weird gut disease. I am also vegan. However, I am worried that I am being misled by internet quacks who want to sell fake or bullshit health tests, out of desperation a few weeks ago i bought and took an organic acids test and it cost £256, and the online nutrition coach who sells the test recommends I take a SIBO test so i can know if I have it, but im concerned ill just be given a false positive which will further amp up my health anxiety and orthorexia. I even spent £300 on a mercury tri-test because I was worried I had mercury poisoning from fillings - Which I now recognise as untrue and a very common case of health quackery. I spent £200 on 'viome' where you send a stool sample and its completely bogus. I dont know what to do, i'm obsessed with the idea that my anxiety is linked to my gut health even though I dont have any of the genuine symptoms of SIBO. I'm just sick of being obsesseed with my health and the food I eat. it had got to the point where I lost a stone and weighed 49-51kg as a 21 year old male at 5""6. 

&amp;#x200B;

healthanxiety,jrnim,2019/02/17,"Been Feeling Feverish ++ Hello! For a while now, I've been feeling feverish, but whenever I go get my temperature checked, it always comes out as normal. Also, I've been having these cramps in my legs, arms and feet. They're not exactly in extreme pain, I guess, but I feel that there is something terribly wrong. Is there something wrong? Is it just my anxiety acting up again?

++ I'm also worried about having a brain tumor, but then again, the only proof I have is having some sort of brain fog + I've been stumbling with my words and have trouble retrieving them. It might be my anxiety... Can't stop thinking about this.

healthanxiety,flowers67poppy,2019/02/17,"Swollen lymph node in neck and groin for months Hello!

So I’ve always had lymph nodes that I can feel easily. The two underneath my jaw swelled up when I was about 12 and remain enlarged now I’m 21. About a year ago I had felt a squishy node in my neck (it’s smaller than a grape) and also one of the same size in my groin region. They are moveable. O do not recall any reasons for them swelling up.

I went to the DR in September who didn’t seem concerned about them, but told me to go back if they didn’t disappear in a few weeks. Of course they’re still here,and I chose not to go back to the DR as I had no other symptoms and thought the stress of having scans etc would do more harm than good.

I’ve felt absolutely fine since the , the nodes haven’t increased in size. But I read a story about how lymph nodes should always go down, and now I’m scared I have lymphoma.This is giving me massive anxiety and symptoms :( 

I plan to ask the Dr tomorrow, but I think I just want some reassurance until then as I’m driving myself crazy!

healthanxiety,consistentbenny,2019/02/17,"How to Live in the Moment and Stop Worrying by Changing Your Relationship With Anxiety Hi!  


I recently found a book which really helped me change my relationship with my worries, being a chronic worrier for as long as I can think. I summarized it in an article that I published on my blog today, hoping that others can find value from the experiences I made.

healthanxiety,scandalabra,2019/02/18,"Anyone ever have to wear a holter monitor? Thank god this thing isn't checking blood pressure or I would screwed... 

I've been having an increased awareness of my heart beat lately. Not necessarily palpitations, just like, I'm constantly aware of the blood closing through my body. Occasionally I feel a flutter in my throat. I asked my doctor about it and he asked if I wanted a 48-hour holter monitor just to be sure. Of course I said yes.

The nurse who put the monitor on me said a lot of very terrifying things about how rare it is for her to see a monitor come back with normal results. She was a real Debbie Downer and it did not help my anxiety about this whole thing. 

So I figured I would ask y'all - have you ever had a holter monitor that came back with good results?

healthanxiety,PhotosByDrew,2019/02/18,"Rabies Anxiety  I touched an umbrella that had bats roosting on it 5 weeks ago today.  Was doing it to take pictures for proper ID, they were Evening Bats. The second I left the neighbors house I was in full on panic mode, still am, despite being reassured by  a bat expert (DNR), a doctor, and the top two rabies scientists (Health Dept) in the state.  It's a scary disease, can't wait until the 8 weeks are gone since that seems to be in the window of hen stuff can start. I will say, I hate that I see so many others worrying about this in here, yet, in a way, it comforts me to know I am not the only one.

healthanxiety,Groovelstory,2019/02/18,"Has anyone been cured of health anxiety? I’m getting to the point of where I’m just fed up with this. I know my anxiety is irrational yet I still can’t help but worry myself into a panic attack everytime I have the mildest of symptoms. Most of my health anxiety revolves around chest pains I get. I’ve seen countless doctors and specialists and they’re convinced it’s either musculoskeletal or anxiety related. Yet everytime I feel that mild ache in my chest that most people would probably ignore I feel convinced that this time its it. This time its really a heart attack or some other life threatening event. I’ve even bought myself a portable ekg monitor which I use almost every time I have my chest pain symptoms to calm myself down. Has anyone been cured of this? This health anxiety is relatively new for me. It started in October 2018 when I first started experiencing these mild chest pains, yet I have no significant risk factors for heart disease nor do any of the countless medical tests I’ve had done to me indicate I have heart disease yet its not enought to put my mind at ease. This is really starting to affect my life as I’m scared of going out and doing fun stuff thinking I’ll get a heart attack or something else and won’t get help in time. Will seeing a therapist or some other health professional help?",6.017955182072833,7.215928190476191,6.439589169000938,75.29626050420171,66.69841269841271,9.897665732959851,31.490196078431374,10.056822442137396,3.2452798319327734,1072,42,188,25,17,347,138,252,0.222,0.6779999999999999,0.1,-0.9876,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,10,14,3,3,8,0,19,22,8,2,0,30,39,12,0,1,8,0,2,0,0,3,13,0,0,0,20,8,1,1,4,0,1,2,5,10,0,1,7,5,22,4,25,29,5,29,0,0,2,0,3,11,0,9,16,121,42,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783609743810328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059650698763472884,0.0,0.33551706035930656,0.0,0.0,0.12266780086524848,0.0,0.0,0.07808689833557403,0.0,0.2993729087636752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08978226328816083,0.0,0.08976514255498569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327645860229835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057936378280984864,0.0,0.07390551778466939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870489613976118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07461219902104664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18331445048250847,0.0,0.049851701868346684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3729570946012525,0.0,0.4157811812092678,0.17638495514313804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04820707492474262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391449415544313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836584299784353,0.0,0.0,0.08856935893473743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08471781099304145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2800118316162757,0.1029172255233238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06081205656602719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08292109949348557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457396936935353,0.0,0.0,0.08818000598469238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11238775912082227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08782021195203632,0.0,0.06989924553708944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06752898016204181,0.0,0.0,0.1862600407158697,0.0,0.07005106313698169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10041519911122608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823434983746569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10184642114559213,0.0,0.05620563500681462,0.0,0.0,0.20459440109972812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07575949058883877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08908106674733704,0.0,0.062311776731679876,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Alsoamdsufferer,2019/02/18,"Anyone else get really bad feelings of impending doom without being scared of a specific illness? My health anxiety is weird in that I don't really fear any 'specific' illness. Instead I worry about dying of an unknown/undiagnosed condition. I worry specifically that my consciousness is about to end, that I'm beginning the process of passing out and I'm never going to wake up.

I primarily get intense feelings of impending doom which leave me paralysed with fear, often unable to do anything but lie down in bed and close my eyes. In the past I used to go to the hospital a lot and beg the doctors not to let me die, but now I at least have the courage to just freak out at home.

The impending feelings of doom are so intense they leave me shaking and feeling cold. Sometimes while huddled in bed in the midst of a panic attack I even involuntarily shake and yell out things to myself like ""Please I don't want to die"". Like the fear of death is so strong I actually blurt things out reflexively without being able to control it.

This is happening to me basically every day now and leading me to spend increasing amounts of time just lying down at home. When I try and socialise I'm often distracted from the conversation by thoughts I'm about to die. I spend about 80% of my life fixated on these horrible thoughts aboht dying and about 10-20% of my life experiencing this intense feeling of doom.

I need help. I don't want to live like this any more.

Has anyone felt this way or been in a similar situation? Is there anything I should try to help myself?",6.0739844577887645,6.858176953020134,6.8409360649947,73.95176792652775,66.38255033557047,10.032073472271282,34.47615683504062,10.064110947511567,3.5338765100671137,1244,56,225,28,19,412,155,298,0.213,0.655,0.132,-0.9804,0,0,0,0,0,1,25.0,0,0,1,3,17,21,1,8,14,0,17,8,2,3,1,42,39,15,6,4,8,0,6,3,0,1,6,1,4,0,12,14,0,1,9,0,2,7,7,16,0,0,4,10,27,5,54,31,5,36,4,4,1,0,4,18,0,4,13,153,39,2,0.0949253085271267,0.0,0.09263340798209922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291049298519531,0.0,0.07261760120125682,0.0,0.0,0.1327479656910495,0.09726219634001433,0.15623088151471934,0.0,0.0,0.10799124231208804,0.0,0.0,0.07925866758736473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064668051759899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06121897102515645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4925874173885954,0.0,0.0,0.09716007560724116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07929791472486758,0.0,0.08407564803074495,0.0,0.0,0.06269727102026061,0.0,0.07997866652909011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3204520886991088,0.23998544088852794,0.0,0.09114318246227916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09918911161559583,0.0,0.1078964807811191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08394213683489249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10090116405679048,0.0,0.0,0.12725286673221262,0.0,0.19043564837855914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010243911953793,0.0,0.09706755935540738,0.1340971053751938,0.13912713265144191,0.0,0.08382078654172488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08070210274860662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038591347864752,0.07321224989576576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137439675629353,0.0,0.0,0.09061694801168838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10419948322763084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12162316668783975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503679368961676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670002399900848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938835573671824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261283140491603,0.0,0.0,0.15072018342136576,0.05535171077127738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288961068580368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08198498861576688,0.0,0.0,0.11197881279847484,0.07534729149941552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1830092200052318,0.0,0.0,0.1928025171868501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,XxthiccxX,2019/02/18,"Brain aneurisms Oh boy, a long time ago I saw a reddit comment on a totally unrelated sub and they explained how you can just have a brain aneurism at any time for not reason and die. I looked it up and apparently doctors don’t really know why they happen or how to stop them. I didn’t think  much of it at the time but whenever I’m in a high stress situation, having an anxiety attack, or when I’m trying to fall asleep the thought comes into my head and it scares me so much. I feel like I’m trapped in my brain and it’s like a bomb can go off any second and I would just die. I read that eating red meat actually increases the chance of it happening (probably by a minuscule amount but anyways) so now I avoid red meat as much as possible.

healthanxiety,mrsdotherightthing,2019/02/18,"Ladies! Talk to me about your how your cycle affects your HA. I’m curious how many other women experience a spike in their anxiety around that time of the month. I’m a 39y/o mom of 5. I had a tubal about a year and a half ago. About a week before my period I get increasingly anxious, have regular panic attacks, and over analyze every bodily sensation. Most of it subsides within a few days of my period starting. I’m wondering if hormones being out of wack are causing anxiety.

healthanxiety,Browndirtylawn,2019/02/18,"Doctors appointment soon. Lots of anxiety I've had a crazy Year. Last year I got a tumor (benign) removed and ever since that whole situation my health anxiety has done the opposite of going away. I got stomach pains maybe one or two weeks before my surgery and it's around my lower abdomen. It got to the point where I went to the ER and they couldn't figure it out even after doing some urine exams. After a bit, it went away. Recently the pain has become chronic though for three weeks now and it feels like a stabbing pain in that area that'll come in waves and is paired with back pain. Cancer is the only thing on my mind especially now that I feel like I'm prone to tumors. I'm very scared. I feel like I'll die tomorrow and nobody would notice or care since they never ask if I'm doing okay even though I'm very obviously going through something and this includes the people closest to me. I can't think about anything else and I don't know what to do besides vent about it here.

healthanxiety,SkellyBirb,2019/02/18,"Doubling up on Ibuprofen and Aspirin/Acetaminophen? Well, I should start this by saying I have a history of headaches near the front and sides of my head(I'm not sure what exactly caused it and I'm considering seeing a doctor about it but that's not the point of this post), and yesterday I had one of these horrible headaches. I took 600mg of Ibuprofen for it and about 12 hours later 500 mg or Acetaminophen and Aspirin(Also 130 mg of Caffeine but I doubt that'd have an effect).

&amp;#x200B;

Upon waking up today I had the same headache as yesterday and I took my medicine I take every morning which is too much to list but they don't interfere with either, but I also took the 500 mg or Acetaminophen and Aspirin. About 10 minutes later the headache was still horrible(It was so bad that I forgot I took the medicine) and I took 600mg of Ibuprofen.

&amp;#x200B;

While I generally try not to double up(or triple up because Acetaminophen and Aspirin in one pill??) and generally limit myself to 400mg of Ibuprofen every 6 hours at least with some cases like yesterday and today where my headaches are generally bad, I will go up to 600 mg and possibly even 800 mg if the original 600 mg of Ibuprofen didn't work after an hour. I really try to avoid this because I've had some stomach issues when I take too much that will go away after taking a normal dose for a while. Even when just taking 200 mg of Ibuprofen I try not to take Aspirin at the same time but I forgot about it because that's just how much pain I was in.

&amp;#x200B;

I most likely have a migraine and combined with sinuses and bad weather outside it can cause these headaches. Luckily the medicine has helped quite a bit but I know they can have side effects and shouldn't be taken together very often(especially in the doses I took them)

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this post is I want to make sure I'm not in immediate danger of anything for taking 500mg of Acetaminophen and Aspirin with 600 mg of Ibuprofen at once(Not asking for the future, I don't plan on taking that much I just want to make sure I'm safe) 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

 I forgot I took 500 mg of Acetaminophen and Aspirin in 2 pills(same pain killer) because of my headache and just waking up and then took 600 mg of Ibuprofen about 10 minutes later and I just want to make sure I'm not at risk for doing this once.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't plan on doubling up like this in the future and it was a mistake of me being in so much pain combined with being tired from just waking up.",6.043024691358021,6.557639927983544,5.975736625514402,81.07348148148148,66.38683127572017,8.208395061728394,32.24938271604938,7.908726449838941,2.2416646913580247,1999,78,373,21,30,628,187,486,0.121,0.826,0.052000000000000005,-0.9911,0,1,0,0,0,0,59.0,0,0,3,7,24,20,1,3,22,0,30,27,4,9,5,87,65,41,0,8,22,0,0,3,0,4,23,1,0,0,22,27,0,7,3,0,0,11,11,11,1,2,20,2,37,9,71,37,17,66,0,0,1,0,6,29,0,7,27,258,59,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08298502682020999,0.0,0.3373050488079482,0.3782766148789628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04269703460205735,0.0,0.04850558520125468,0.0,0.04874778018119327,0.0,0.12996572917007468,0.12651475544501567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05664511522120276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066006256543622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053106621045981066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06853926763395804,0.0,0.08743090633837931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058975021182577414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05324910414849042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03477750366251612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15328918146515147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054154587310549035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028514706201454295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07604534954050003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10390116571981156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19070767366741415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05083640341857632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055255961705697916,0.07031740308581573,0.0,0.16562828431166887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09809642230521316,0.05849267930225863,0.09938320922817992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05518621403564585,0.0,0.0,0.0332389378216062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0412611316224774,0.0,0.0,0.04134572473656598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03672455648453622,0.0,0.04143552554410088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19560445423425574,0.0,0.2730780825336208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030254631954587493,0.05963431526184947,0.0983620579946144,0.0,0.4611702381714735,0.1056797762624715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04281065959477203,0.0918095679624644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0466509559344091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03777298684883125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3782766148789628,0.0
healthanxiety,l0st_in_my_head,2019/02/18,"New panic attack symptoms Hi guys , 28 male here, I have been suffering from anxiety most of my life. I had a panic disorder before ( 5 years ago ) that I treated with therapy. I also started using alcohol and it got me addicted. Now im sober but the panic attack have started to come back. It all started when trying to fall asleep I got jolts that would wake me up the moment I was entering a sleep state.

Doctor as prescribed me 10mg lexapro and I have been on it for a week. I actually feel a little bit worse ? 

I also have bad pvcs ( heart palpitations ) and they are one of the worst offenders of my anxiety.
This morning I had one while driving and it snowball into a panic attack, I had a completely new symptoms : Burning sensation in my chest. 

Does anyone have ever feel that before ? I feel hopeless like I will never get my life back. It suck so much. Like im always dancing with death.

healthanxiety,rachlexis13,2019/02/18,"Freaking out itchy skin Hi,

So, last night, my skin all over just started to itch, along with my scalp. It just was driving me nuts. I finally managed to sleep though. 

Today, not much has changed. I'm still just itchy all over. I took a shower and used tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner as I saw lots of flakes in my hair. I have checked throughly for lice and had my family members check for me. They said it didn't look like lice at all.  So,I assume it is dandruff. 

My scalp is now a bit better, but it's still itchy and my skin is too. I'll be okay for a few minutes tjen back to itching. Itss driving me crazy and now I of course googled. It said itching skin can be a sign of liver or kidney disease. I'm now in a full blown panic attack. I don't know what to do.",1.1673824130879351,2.903627251533745,2.474993865030676,96.67281799591005,80.16564417177914,5.0828629856850736,21.90961145194274,5.6839178017228535,-0.058216032719836,594,18,139,3,15,191,102,163,0.14,0.833,0.027000000000000003,-0.9456,1,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,1,1,12,6,1,1,5,1,13,14,13,1,3,22,23,10,0,0,6,0,5,1,0,0,3,2,1,0,6,8,1,0,2,0,2,3,3,3,0,0,7,10,16,3,20,14,8,21,0,0,2,0,4,7,0,3,12,87,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23214761139633835,0.0,0.15690947811795478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18047441131654685,0.22278057520221464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2158683317963382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19236952619749675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2235376615863539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11214599219147392,0.16633606554978098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969336659144523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17135893408705793,0.0,0.0,0.1734844417624948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500075163381428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914964060362276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23942034209553226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38821541522198494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20420728378397526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14443465752910656,0.0,0.3259250220772999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20048782958793496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19342493851889556,0.0,0.2267180729635245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17624224770470898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,DirtyAriel,2019/02/19,"Women of r/healthanxiety: hormonal birth control possibly causing pain in breast? Sorry if the flair is wrong.  BUT okay so I’m (26F) on the pill and have been for nearly 4 years.  I love it other than my anxiety has gotten worse since I’ve been on it, and a lot of what I have is health anxiety.

So I have 21 active pills and 7 placebos.  I usually always take my off week as having a period of some sort makes me feel normal (yes I know it’s not a real period, or at least it shouldn’t be if I’m not ovulating).  I decided to skip my off week between my last pack and current pack, and I’ve been having some serious pain in my right breast.  It’s mostly only if I touch it, and it’s always in the same spot. This has been going on for almost a week.  Could it be because I skipped my placebos, or could it be something worse?  I’ve been trying to do my self breast exams as often as I can and I haven’t noticed anything abnormal until now, but I also know that hormones can cause lumps that move around during a woman’s cycle.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

healthanxiety,brittundecided,2019/02/19,"2 Week Rule Hi everyone!

I wanted to share something very helpful I learned from this subreddit.

While browsing one day, I saw someone say that they wait to go to the doctor until they've been having symptoms for 2 weeks. I started thinking about that, and it has helped me sooo much to internalize it.

Whenever I have a weird symptom (most days), I tell myself this: ""That's fine. Have something weird happen. I will go to the doctor in **two weeks** if it hasn't gotten any better. I will freak out then, but I'm not going to worry about it until it's time to book the appointment."" And believe it or not, symptoms almost always disappear within a day or two.....

I really hope that will help some of you, too. 

We're all in this together, I hope you have a calm day. &lt;3

healthanxiety,dentdleao,2019/02/19,"Irrational Fear of Developing Food Allergies Has anyone ever felt that before? I’ve seen only one post online about it.

Here’s the thing. When I first started having big anxiety attacks, I read one book and watched a series where a character dies from food (peanuts) allergy. I think I shouldn’t have seen those things, but it kind of stayed in my mind, and now I’m scared of eating anything that isn’t common for me. I would also see posts appearing on my social media about people suddenly developing allergies and it made me extra scared, even though I’m an adult with no allergies, and only one person in my family has it (my mom, shrimp).

healthanxiety,EatGainsFartGains,2019/02/19,"Shin splints persisting for more than a month, dont know if i should wait...  

Hey people.

Back in december 8th, i had some ankle pain which came after sitting or sleeping, and went away after walking for a bit. This continued until around new years eve and went away. During that, i have been trying to get a faster 5k time, running 2 times a week at a moderate pace. Keeping at it, at january 16th, i ran significantly faster because i increased my cadence from 165 to 180, so i took 4 minues off my 5k.

The day after, my shin started hurting, a dull ache on the upper 2/3 just outside my shinbone. The pain was very diffuse, and I still have trouble finding out if it is my bone or muscle hurting. However this pain came only when i stood for a long time, and at night. Running on it didnt really change the pain, however I was limping a little bit (a friend pointed it out, he didnt know about it).

I stopped running on the 22nd january, hoping it would get better, However, the pain persisted. At the 31st of january, I called my doctor and asked for an appointment, she game me one at february 26th, which i think is a long time to wait with this ache, however since it didnt really hurt THAT bad, so i guess i could wait (pain is 3-4 out of 10).

On february 2nd, i went skiing, and the pain subsided a littlebit, however it has been acompanied with a sharper, more localized pain an inch below my tibial tuberosity, and one to the left of it(PIC: [https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r](https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r)) . I dont know if this is because I have fallen a couple of times (I had many more bruises, but they disapeared 4-5 days after coming home). I came home on the 10th of february, and My pain still persists, i have tried the RICE method, and stretching, nothing works.

At the point im typing this, I havent run for a long time, and its been 10 days since ive been skiing. The pain has increased this week, and today it is on an all time high. I can still walk, and bike, but it is starting to intefere even more, and the ankle pain has come back too. I to have my legs up for as long time as possible, the last days i have rested 10 hours minimum in the daytime, practicing RICE.

Should I call my doc to get an earlier appointment? I called her today to ask for advice, based on this story, she assumed it was shin splints and told me to stretch.

What do you think it is?  
I may add that i am a hypochondriac, and somewhere inside me keeps telling me it could be bone cancer, and I really hate that, so I try to stay optimistic, and think about the rarity of it, albeit I am on strong Immunosuppressants. The thought of it being cancer and just assuming it is something else makes me extremely anxious.

TL;DR: Dull shin pain began after running pb (15th jan), stopped running about a week after, pain persisted, and after 8 days of skiing (1st feb-9th feb), has gotten accompanied by a sharp pain in the bone. (Pic of location: [https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r](https://imgur.com/jNpPV1r)) from friday it started getting worse. I have an appointment on the 26th feb, should i call for an earlier? I am afraid this is more serious than a shin splint, maybe a stress fracture, maybe bone cancer...

sorry for the long post, i just think a more detailed description helps. I really hope you can help.

healthanxiety,Kat3691,2019/02/19,"Can’t handle this feeling I found a small black dot under my big toe nail. Like a sharpie dot. I googled and it could be a very rare but serious form of skin cancer. If it grows out, it’s just a blood blister. If not, it could be skin cancer. I don’t recall stubbing my toe. I’m 28, Caucasian but not super fair haired/eyed/skin. 
Ugh, I can’t wait to see if it grows out. But I also feel ridiculous going to the doctor for a black dot. 
I wake up in the mornings with the sickening thought that I have skin cancer and it ruins my day. My stomach is gurgled and in knots and I’m convinced the cancer has spread.
The only reason I think I’ve got this intense health anxiety now is because my mom got diagnosed a few months ago with breast and she felt fine :/ the lump was found during a routine mammogram, it was so tiny still even she didn’t know it was there.",0.43520085129023656,2.7035951005586583,1.973391859537113,96.09618249534452,86.82122905027933,4.526842245278,19.696993881351425,5.916634753146586,-0.14557323756318175,669,20,147,5,21,216,109,179,0.266,0.682,0.052000000000000005,-0.994,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,1,7,9,1,1,13,0,15,18,9,1,0,30,30,13,0,5,9,1,6,1,0,0,9,0,0,0,11,9,0,1,9,0,0,3,6,5,0,0,10,9,15,4,12,16,2,16,0,1,3,1,3,8,0,3,6,88,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17449628327395794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15742144721604362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15059025965435366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1199983699438166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3143385591746017,0.0,0.0,0.12695242737226506,0.0,0.0,0.19979933401821176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2014850500663171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001804199498976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1990672743733787,0.0,0.18900755857632487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43167330123262493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11187479886307848,0.0,0.3148790019829406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20924310695181197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10818400593876848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09617131698269192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305491805335165,0.1571243641954527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14971384066526638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20239532245406885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15686453505227466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15720523683005294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12613399093104072,0.0,0.15627748081123927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16242245734964655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ba1909,2019/02/19,"Does anyone else fear they will constantly get food poisoning? I’m a food lover and certainly don’t hold back on eating new things. But over the past year, my health anxiety has grown to have a newfound paranoia...whenever I cook, I’m scared I will undercook things like chicken, fish, beef, etc. It’s not taking over my life or anything, but my boyfriend thinks I’ve become a total hypochondriac! 

Does anyone else have this? I have health anxiety generally and am frequently scarred I’ll get the flu, etc. But food poisoning is a new one....perhaps it’s because I’ve had some bad bouts of illness over the past few years after travelling. How do you get over this unnecessary anxiety?",5.061093749999999,6.9689291718750015,5.25825,80.16175000000003,69.78125,9.495,30.76875,9.888512548439397,3.157425625,546,23,100,14,10,172,84,128,0.222,0.7340000000000001,0.044,-0.9744,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,1,0,2,8,2,2,7,0,11,13,0,1,2,14,18,7,0,0,5,0,0,1,1,2,7,0,0,0,6,2,5,1,1,2,0,2,2,5,0,0,1,0,8,3,8,15,5,17,0,0,0,1,3,5,0,2,11,54,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.288225558291003,0.0,0.0,0.17562939696147864,0.2573613961075926,0.10334898679746936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657013341876504,0.1048615089494944,0.07655784477794839,0.1387031038525625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13571701478366394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21980743428089375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285088265592962,0.20982686809445056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28012970510069063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14132245969593155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4555878904100618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968450940190167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2669903151246586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870717388670722,0.061356406433679164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24258913833384885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510230781692428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2397776847416586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12573642600072818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944272440512951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16687140643478504,0.08047231394428918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16175030395499534

healthanxiety,throwaway24883,2019/02/20,"Stiff neck and head aches, worried this could be be bacterial meningitis after ear infection? About 6 days ago I started getting strange head aches. I felt a sudden, short sharp pain on the left side of my head which was followed by extreme warmth and a panic attack. Since then I've had sharp head pain come randomly for a couple seconds, then go. It's usually on the left middle side of my head, but sometimes happens on the right. I've also been having bouts of pain in the back of the head as well. I haven't needed to take medicine for this as the pain comes randomly and isn't painful enough to need relief.

&amp;#x200B;

 From the first day this happened I also had stiff shoulders and neck. I assumed this was because of anxiety/ that the headaches were from stress/ muscle strain. Today the neck pain got so bad I needed advil. It feels very stiff and over the course of the last hour it's gotten significantly worse. The advil hasn't kicked in yet even though i took it 30 mins ago. I'm really worried this could be bacterial meningitis? I got an ear infection a couple days before the initial headaches.

healthanxiety,david4011,2019/02/20,"Worried about colon cancer Around Christmas time I started having upper abdominal pain, it lasted a few weeks and eventually turned into loose stools every morning. The abdominal pain got better but the loose stools kept up until about the first week of February. I think it lasted about 5 weeks total. I haven’t had any since then except for one last Saturday morning, and a bit of constipation last week. This all started after a couple of really bad weeks of eating and sleeping. A lot of overtime work and I ate a lot of garbage food like pizza and chocolate. 

I now feel kinda gassy sometimes but I think the rest is closer to normal now.... Also.. about 4 weeks ago I went to the washroom and saw a couple of bright spots of red on the toilet paper that went away after a few wipes. I have gone to my family doctor and I did an ultrasound and all was fine. Despite that I’m convinced I might have colon cancer after reading online and despite my family history of colon issues my doctor doesn’t want to do a colonoscopy. 

I dunno what to do....

I called my Dr who said to go get a tetanus shot since my last one was 2012.  I went to a local urgent care and got the shot. I am so freaked out I have tetanus even though it had not been 10 years since my last shot and I went to get a booster.

healthanxiety,paninizphillips,2019/02/21,"HA Hopelessness I have had health related anxiety issues for the past 5 months, and just when they seem to be getting better and I have a solid week, it all comes crashing down again.

At the beginning I was convinced that I was going to have a heart attack, then it was a pulmonary embolism, and now I think I have some kind of emphysema or lung cancer (I used to smoke and it haunts me). I can't make it stop, and it seems like once I handle one issue and a doctor clears me, my brain just latches onto another new thing and starts a new cycle of tracking symptoms, googling and doctors appointments. Like jesus fucking christ, enough already! It makes me feel so hopeless and sad, I don't want to go through this every day. It's like my own personal hell loop, because I feel like I can't trust my own brain to make rational decisions about anything. 

How do you all cope with the hopelessness and feeling of being trapped in your own head all the time? At this point the general anxiety about having HA is almost as bad as the HA itself.

healthanxiety,dustedrose,2019/02/21,"Painful, hard lump behind ear.... Mastoiditis? I have this painful, hard lump on my mastoid process (that hard bone that's right behind the ear) on only my right side. I literally just noticed it about an hour ago. It's tender to the touch and now I can feel dull pain in that spot without touching it. I have no idea if it's been there all day, I didn't notice it at all.

The closest thing I can find that it could be is mastoiditis. I have no other symptoms other than the fact that I noticed my hearing was slightly worse than my right ear a couple of times in today (before I noticed the bump).

I'm extremely scared and I don't have any support, everyone around me writes things off as nothing. I keep reading things about needing antibiotics through an IV but I can't find very many people talking about mastoiditis... and obviously I don't even know if that's what it is exactly.

healthanxiety,Lurker9605,2019/02/21,"Worried about liver and jaundice, history of drinking. In my late 20s. Used to drink alot in my early 20s and by mid twenties to now cut down drinking alot. 

Last year have a liver panel done and everything came back perfect. However I still drink about 2 beers every day sometimes 3 and just recently I swear I've been seeing a slight yellow discoloration. In the corners of my eyes and underneath the eye lids. However the yellow tint appears around the small red vessels in the whites of my eyes. Idk if I'm seeing things or if my chronicaly dry eyes is to blame

Can 2-3 beers a day destroy my liver in a years time? And if my eyes are yellow wouldn't my skin be too?",3.989172932330831,5.405573669172932,4.768428571428572,84.56407142857147,71.70676691729324,7.726015037593986,27.58571428571429,8.238735603445708,1.83312090225564,530,19,103,8,10,171,83,133,0.101,0.871,0.028,-0.755,2,0,6,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,1,8,3,2,0,11,0,8,15,9,1,1,19,14,10,0,4,5,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,8,6,0,0,6,0,2,1,2,0,0,3,13,10,1,17,9,2,25,0,0,12,0,0,11,0,7,12,62,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15366747985221885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13273333211047147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19743011444071565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22264990932643924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17664913742278446,0.0,0.6764034919892082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454389264680223,0.0,0.1551387988982937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14070749896938098,0.19472171590614104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17044040708589597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27510993865055605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17072457430276855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785373171013285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11468037283329376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10065550905146647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14908736602195286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1753029422526614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22232191313982616

healthanxiety,Squacamole,2019/02/21,"Health Anxiety / Phobias I had posted this in the general anxiety sub, someone pointed me to this sub in the comments so I'm cross-posting here: 

I'm new here.  I've suffered with anxiety for as long as I can remember, but it took an existential crisis for me to seek treatment about 10 years ago.  I've been medicated ever since.  The meds definitely help me feel more ""normal"", but I'm never 100% without anxiety.  It's still always there.  

I have some chronic health problems, and after suffering for years (see a pattern here?) I have finally gotten up the nerve to try to figure out what is wrong.  For years I've told myself my symptoms are just anxiety related (IBS, body pain, fatigue, extreme migraines, etc.)  It has now gotten to the point where I'm sick more often than not, I'm missing a lot of work and I'm not able to be a good mother or wife.  I'm spending most of my time in the fetal position in bed.  I'm in pain all of the time, sometimes so severe I can barely move.  I'm losing weight without trying.  I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. 

The problem is, I am really freaked out by doctors and all the associated medical tests/procedures.   I have a GP who handles my anxiety meds, and I see her regularly, but I am awful at getting tests done and awful at seeing specialists .... even though I know logically that I need to go do these things to find out what is wrong with me so I can get better.  

In a moment of bravery, I made myself appointments with all of the specialists I've been told to see over the years... gastroenterologist, neurologist, rheumatologist, dentist and oral surgeon.   I've gone to a couple of the appts and of course all of them want me to get tests done or bloodwork done.  I feel paralyzed when I think about getting those things done.  For example, I have orders for bloodwork.  I just have to walk into the lab and let them draw blood.... super easy and no big deal.  I have driven myself there 5 times in the last week and been unable to force myself to walk through the door to get it done.  I break out in a sweat, panic, and get back in the car and leave.  Then I spend the rest of the day hating myself for it.   Feeling like an idiot because I didn't get it done.  

My GI doctor also ordered an ultrasound, which I forced myself to do (I've had two kids and knew US were easy, so this didn't freak me out as much).  However, she called me back to tell me that my US results are abnormal and that they might need to do a biopsy... so of course now I am absolutely freaking out.  

Does anyone else have this problem?  I feel paralyzed and terrified over the simplest things and hate myself for it.  I need to stop being such a coward and get this stuff done so I can figure out why I am so sick and try to fix it.

So I'm trying to resist my impulses to look up for symptoms and I find it so hard, I spend 8+ hours in front of a computer for work and it's just so tempting to open a Google search which will lead me to WebMD to autodiagnose myself with MS, RA or some other nasty stuff.

healthanxiety,IndustrializedWolf,2019/02/21,"Mono nightmare Towards the beginning of 2019 I began feeling something weird in my throat, as if a ball of mucus was stuck there. I thought it was allergies but never took any allergy medication. Fast forward to 1 week ago where I'm following a terrible flipped sleep schedule going to sleep at 10am and waking up at 6pm. I woke up at 4pm one day and was so tired that I ended up falling asleep at 10pm. After getting 9 hours of sleep I still remained tired throughout the day. I assumed it was due to my sudden shift in sleep schedules but the daytime fatigue continued. Eventually, I scheduled a physical exam to see what was going on, all while assuming the absolute worst case scenario. The doctor brought up mono as a possibility but I didn't think much of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Again fast forward to today, I receive a call from the doctor saying that my bloodwork came back positive for mono. I was shocked. But for some reason, I've been having a heart/chest pain that pops up for a few seconds at different times throughout the day and almost as it were to perfectly coincide with my diagnosis. Now there are some complications with mono such as heart inflammation however they are said to be quite rare.

healthanxiety,KevinTheKoop,2019/02/22,"I’ve been managing my health anxiety pretty well! .....until today So, I’m on 150mg of Zoloft daily, along with Lamictal (not certain about the dosage). Today, I was taking my daily pills but I accidentally took an extra pill, which I guess would mean I took 250mg. My mom called the pharmacist who said I should be fine but to look out for fainting. Ironically, I felt lightheaded just seconds after realizing I’d taken more than the prescribed dose. So I’m guessing that was anxiety because no pill affects you that fast (as far as I’m aware).

But, technically, it still is an overdose, but a small one. Whenever I drink water, it feels weird on my throat and there’s a tickle in my throat (though that could be a mix of allergies and anxiety). And when I got up at first I felt dizzy.

I looked it up and it says that 200mg is usually the max dosage. I took 50mg more. I’m afraid to sleep or anything. This happened around 5 hours ago. If I’d overdosed on a fatal level, would I have exhibited severe and obvious symptoms by now? I’m just so paranoid now ",2.32357142857143,4.480774452380956,4.013571428571428,84.98892857142859,78.28571428571429,7.2476190476190485,24.309523809523807,8.238735603445708,1.5611238095238096,825,29,166,16,20,276,134,210,0.128,0.835,0.037000000000000005,-0.9594,0,0,1,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,0,1,14,6,0,1,10,0,12,13,3,1,2,32,33,19,1,5,9,1,3,0,0,3,8,2,0,0,11,9,2,0,5,1,0,3,2,3,1,3,11,7,18,3,23,16,3,28,0,0,2,0,6,12,0,4,13,105,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818521656128705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3059814590089844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1097157169367414,0.1186881677324044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08127412843828717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13614047857290504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106449747790008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13060845923484446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741349583688834,0.0,0.25602722101527803,0.0,0.0,0.11340679910523717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066327670186819,0.0,0.2937466490483766,0.0,0.11789950405131107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14171901799324513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13129898910501045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22392007103457176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14523080738206315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15614948535380846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034496616210397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356402004021652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12682330194272035,0.10602597299258876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506201269354093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13342201774975387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106474101400537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13857648454033447,0.10024435749671204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13099185426798274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527544081886299,0.0,0.444389380162302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14683945713084215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11987584439602746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894215487123404,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,bluemood16,2019/02/22,"Night sweats for 2 years To keep it short, I have PTSD, agoraphobia, depression and anxiety (specially health anxiety). 

I started a new round of antidepressants 2 years and I got really bad night sweats. I figured it was because of of the meds but they didn’t work for me and I stopped about 6 months later but the night sweats NEVER went away... My partner complains that my body gets really hot at night and I wake up drenched in sweat a couple times a week.

We didn't get home until 12:30 and so that made me anxious knowing I wouldn't get the best sleep. I woke up multiple times through out the night and just shaking and when I woke up for the day, I was drenched in a cold sweat. I've gone to bed anxious like this before but I've never woken up like this before. Is this normal?? I was a bit nauseous and dizzy as well.

healthanxiety,bugzhunny,2019/02/22,"What triggers your palpitations and what do they feel like? So I’ve been dealing with intermittent palpitations for the past 6 months or so. I haven’t had an EKG done yet just because I’m in between doctors and my psychiatrist (MD not therapist) said she wasn’t worried about them and thought they were fine when I told her about them. 
From what she told me and what I’ve learned, I think I’ve been feeling ectopic beats. For me, it feels kind of like my stomach drops- like when you’re in an elevator going down. I can also feel like the air is pushed out of my lungs and I feel a super faint little tap in my chest, then my heartbeat goes back to normal. I sometimes feel adrenaline and lightheadedness right when it first happens, but I’m not sure if that’s a physical response to the palpitation or if it’s my anxiety reacting. I’ve never felt a run of any, it’s always just a single missed beat that I feel (when they’re bad I get 3-5 per day at most). I’ve been trying really hard to figure out what triggers them for me, and it seems to be correlated with breathing variance, stress, and posture. For instance, I feel them most often if I’m talking quickly and run low on breath and then take in a quick breath. I also feel them sometimes when bending over or bending backward.  Also, if I’ve been sitting down and then stand up and stretch I can feel a tightness in my whole chest area and my heart will beat slow and hard and I can feel an ectopic if I move too quickly or breathe weird during this. I wanted to know if anyone else has these same triggers, and if not then what are they and how do the palps feel? I’m working on not worrying so much about mine, but it’s comforting to know other people experience similar things.

healthanxiety,Soft_Pretzel89,2019/02/22,"Avoiding doctor office calls and scheduling appointments I am at a point where I’m just too tired and bogged down to keep making more appointments. I have a genetics referral, cardiology referral, hematology referral, psychiatry referral and a referral to a specialty functional movement disorder clinic 12 hours away. I have 3 different doctors offices calling me a day trying to get ahold of me. I get emails saying “Answer your phone! Your results are abnormal! You need to call us.” I know they are abnormal, I have eyes, I can read. I’m just too tired right now. On top of the doctors I have debt collections from surgeries out the wazoo calling all day. I just hide from my phone on my room, probably getting sicker. I just can’t mentally and physically keep up with the constant anxiety and trips everywhere. Im afraid of reaching out to these people too, since they are angry and frustrated with me for being difficult to contact. Everything about it makes me want to panic and crawl in a hole. But one panic attack leaves me so tired I’m bedridden for a couple days. Ugh. Any advice on appointment and call feat or just listening is/has been appreciated.

healthanxiety,ASJ_703,2019/02/23,"So annoyed with myself...health anxiety resurgence Hey guys

So annoyed with myself, even though I guess it isn’t really my fault, I used to have pretty bad health anxiety a few years ago. It started to subside somewhat after I got a scan done after I felt a lump, it was just a cyst. Right around that time I was also immigrating from the UK to the US so my life got super busy and the health anxiety virtually went away. I’ve been in the US for almost two years now and haven’t really had any ‘big’ health worries since I got the scan done in England years ago...until this week. My wife passed onto me, I guess some sort of virus, and I had flu like symptoms - of course, a lymph node on my neck has swollen - as is pretty topical with stuff like that - and I’m now convinced I have lymphoma. 0 to 60 in about a week, unbelievable. This time feels different though, when this sort of stuff happened in the past my rational thought was completely obscured to the point where any logical or rational thought would immediately be dismissed in favor of the worst case scenario, but this time I’m well aware how irrational I’m being, and I’m well aware that it’s most likely just due to this infection. But I’m still worrying. I made the mistake of Googling it, and although Google does say that with cancerous lumps in the neck they’re typically immovable, mine is movable, I’m still panicking!",5.3199545642296595,6.285236561338291,5.635359355638169,81.27754130524578,68.14498141263941,9.249153242461793,30.5578273440727,9.444778638647367,2.617725980999587,1101,42,215,22,18,351,151,269,0.119,0.804,0.077,-0.884,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,2,0,0,1,20,14,2,0,16,0,18,15,2,3,0,35,38,19,0,2,5,1,2,3,0,1,13,1,0,1,16,11,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,6,2,1,16,5,20,8,31,19,5,35,0,0,2,0,6,14,0,10,22,135,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17060027321180102,0.0,0.0963582393176284,0.0,0.0,0.07695333505267328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13087640445239251,0.0,0.22084200555493644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566314142875972,0.0,0.0,0.09040918356234952,0.0,0.08034619163975137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10089301507553136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10053756755134252,0.0,0.0,0.084209594232908,0.19694889324493464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06355755283333019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04865566583774815,0.0,0.09239377632356928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308864811862983,0.0,0.21201153596362435,0.09528064863348627,0.08509392370685889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4091425965517133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06796853930792585,0.14103612390380246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09105306887233684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918603213046844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09096637239723313,0.0,0.0,0.1957965295525184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12329198251741018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08217801345404806,0.0,0.07652420703016942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07960062864612832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811053049216066,0.0,0.15369528708773053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22031561212985892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001752677354712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18908664532547287,0.15278824524526893,0.1683336080428681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400057590473797,0.0,0.2315003848281165,0.0831099210650288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15437626988356762,0.0,0.17304069324823276,0.08920413253078235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19544799914086186,0.0,0.06835746657402376,0.0,0.0,0.18590264029505107

healthanxiety,kingqp,2019/02/23,"Health anxiety that has lead to panic disorder My health anxiety has led to panic disorder, my panic attacks are almost daily now honestly. Me health anxiety has gotten worse over the course of college, I used to get sick or feel something and go on about my day and not care too much. But now if I even get a cough or cold I think I have lung cancer or something, lately I’ve been short of breath anytime I try and do anything, night just all be in my head but it makes me wanna just lay in bed. I’m an active person, I lift 5-6x a week, been taking some time off here and there because of the anxiety and panic attacks. I noticed whenever I see something like a friend being diagnosed with pulmonary embolism that I’ll look it up and then think I have it, or feel a normal bodily sensation and get fixated on it and make everything  worse until I’m in panic mode. I would have to say the worst thing is being dizzy, I feel like I’m constantly dizzy most places leaving my house and it makes me uncomfortable and fear I’ll pass out although this wouldn’t happen bc my BP is normal at those times or high if anything. I’d just like to know other health anxiety worries of people, fears, panic attack stories, what you’ve done to cope? Because I have a lexapro prescription but not sure about it yet.

healthanxiety,moleha1995,2019/02/23,Does anyone else here suffer from immense fear of skin cancer? It's a terrible feeling. I've been suffering for about a year now. I've been to my derm about 5 times and my GP 3 times. I'm freaking out about a freckle near the top of my butt bc it looks a little red around it sometimes. I know they don't want to see me again. I just want to be able to go on with my life. I know it's good to be checking my skin but I check mine over 10 times a day. This is the 7th freckle/mole I've been fixated on.

healthanxiety,Sfb_93,2019/02/23,"Anxiety the cause of fatigue and other symptoms? Hey guys! Normally I try to avoid seeking reassurance as much as possible, but right now I’m just too scared, so I feel the need to share. It’s quite a lot, so please bear with me. 

I’m a guy who has experienced all kinds of vague symptoms for about one and a half year.   It all started when I experienced dizziness and nausea while exercising, which was strange because I was a young and sporty guy. I then started experiencing the following symptoms on a daily basis:

- chest pains/palpitations
- dizziness/feeling off-balance
- feeling like I can’t take a full breath
- loss of appetite, felt sick after one bite of food
- feeling like I would pass out (without actually passing out)
- worsening of symptoms in heat/cold
- nervousness, anxiety, panic attacks

I am especially worried about my heart and have had several ECG’s, 5 day Holter, 2 stress tests and an echocardiogram. Apart from PAC’s/PVC’s, which my cardiologist says are benign, nothing bad was found. The diagnosis was hypochondria/anxiety. On the one hand it sounds believable to me, as I have experienced social anxiety and body dysmorphia in the past. On the other hand, I can’t accept that it’s just anxiety because of the severity of the symptoms. Almost a year of therapy have not improved the symptoms much either.

I don’t experience full-blown panic attacks or chest pains as often as I used to. Instead I have been getting more palpitations and heavy fatigue. The fatigue is a relatively new symptom that started 4 months ago, and it scares me the most. I usually have energy in the morning, but from around 12 the fatigue sets in, preventing me from doing anything. When I googled it, I found out fatigue is linked to heart disease, making me even more anxious. My doctor says that it is due to adrenal fatigue and lack of activity, which finally leads to my question...

Can such heavy fatigue really be caused by anxiety or a lack of activity (I am scared to exercise and don’t leave the house much)? Is it possible that I’m just experiencing some kind of burn-out from being anxious for a over a year? I find it so hard to believe, since I’m also tired on days that I’m seemingly not anxious.

Thanks for bearing with my long story!

Cheers!

I decided to try this because my doctor says that I have PMDD. It's day two and I seriously feel so manic and disassociated from myself.

I've had a constant headache. And feeling of nausea. Do I keep taking it or can I stop? Because I literally feel like hell right now. This is why I stopped taking birth control in the first place.

healthanxiety,mokate619,2019/02/23,"Can health anxiety cause real symptoms? Hi, firstly I wanna say that I am a 20 year old male and I think I have developed severe health anxiety in the last 4 months, I woke up one morning with an awful left back ache spreading to my chest, left shoulder and arm. 
Went to hospital they told me it’s a muscle cramp gave me naproxen and told me to go see a physio if it doesn’t get any better.

I wasn’t getting any better after few weeks I started feeling really shit had fever, dizziness, blurry vision, body aches, awful stomach cramps, bloating, chills, sweats and back ache. 
Went to the doctors got an ultrasound done and was diagnosed with a kidney infection had antibiotics for a week  and they told me it’s clear after a check up. 

At this stage I was still getting daily stomach cramps and tightness especially in the left side of stomach, hip and shoulder, dizzy spells and blurry vision. 

After weeks of not caring the symptoms have improved now I only get tightness in left side of stomach/back and light bloating, sometimes it spreads to the hip or to the shoulder and I sometimes get dizzy spells but all the other symptoms are going. 

I wanna say that I constantly worry about the symptoms as it is there everyday and I haven’t been eating enough because of it all. I’ve done so many tests at my doctors as well as few scans and everything comes up clear and they say I’m healthy although I feel shit.

Do you think I have developed health anxiety over this due to constant stress and worry and this is what causes the feeling of tightness and bloating that I get everyday? 

Has anyone experienced any physical symptoms similar to this due to health anxiety and constant worry or stress?

I had one last night after an intense game of overwatch, i was mowing people down as ashe and had some messed thoughts so my heart starting pounding very very fast like a heart attack and i instantly thought that. I got off to lay down it wouldnt stop, it kept going for a while and then it felt like my heart was drowning in its own blood and my chest was warm. I started shaking intensely. Family said everything was alright but all their comments flew over my head. I layed in bed and just eventually passed out. Scariest thing ive ever felt so far. I'm a healthy 21 year old.﻿ ",2.1654129464285745,4.712172929687501,2.8179017857142874,91.14406250000002,81.421875,5.5321428571428575,24.767857142857146,6.868970318607317,0.9814982142857144,517,20,102,6,14,161,93,128,0.069,0.812,0.119,0.6348,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,1,4,9,2,2,4,1,9,7,7,0,2,19,22,11,1,1,2,0,3,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,6,6,0,2,5,1,0,5,2,5,0,2,15,4,12,4,13,6,3,26,0,0,0,0,4,9,0,1,14,60,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535508183779716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14055664771702564,0.0,0.0,0.13965202497930496,0.0,0.14648525351827155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2983922219913624,0.0,0.0,0.13217230042863465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08831014502552342,0.0,0.1242773645771558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15947212957412546,0.0,0.0,0.5524038553654838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266613335954069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1518287055949288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14582039130904553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16305276136999827,0.0,0.10529441007070084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10772594181094702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478088412509526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21996776561433587,0.0,0.0,0.1299106839961026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10323237259333512,0.09956586420683512,0.0,0.2467202110737137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2564214802567644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10006428304116304
healthanxiety,goobloops,2019/02/24,"Has anyone had similar lymph node experiences? Hi all, I’ve managed to completely convince myself I’ve got some sort of lymphoma. 

Basically about 3 months ago I noticed my right tonsil had swelled up and the lymph node connected to it under my ear had as well and is hard. 

I saw my GP and they weren’t too concerned and referred me to an ENT. My ENT appointment is in 2 weeks. 

I’ve got myself worried to death that I must have lymphoma. So I’m wondering if anyone else has had any similar experiences with swollen lymph nodes / tonsils, and what it turned out to be? 

Thanks all.

healthanxiety,thunders89,2019/02/24,"Health anxiety about Multiple Sclerosis? For the past year i have had neurological symptoms that lead me to googling then becoming fixated on MS. I started getting muscle twitches all over and on my mouth particularly, then a tingling/buzzing  heel of my left foot, muscle soreness on my arms, tingling tip of nose and scalp, various shooting pains and horrible neck pain. This was all on and off. My foot has been “buzzing” for months and months on and off. I had cancer when I was younger and my doctors think I just have health anxiety, or neuropathy from old chemo (which is uncommon) anyways i got a new doctor and she scared me more because she told me “it doesnt sound like full blown MS but i can do some tests” basically even though she said it didnt sound like it, she still didnt rule it out. that was enough to scare me into a spiraling panic. I google my symptoms every day, read up On MS and i’m fully convinced i have it. I even posted on the MS forum here but now I wonder if it could all just be anxiety. I’m terrified. I’ve been obsessing over this for a year now. I haven’t had any debilitating symptoms like numbess or pins and needles or vision loss. I got a full eye exam and they said my eyes were 100 percent healthy.

healthanxiety,svarela128,2019/02/24,"Can health anxiety cause cold-like symptoms? Hey guys!

Let me start off by saying that I suffer from pretty strong health anxiety but have recently started therapy to deal with it.

Three weeks ago, the very week I started therapy, I caught a cold. It was a very difficult week as I pretty much thought I was dying.

Anyway, it has been two weeks since it has passed and since then, I’ve had pain in my throat on and off, moving in different places in my throat (sometimes the left side, sometimes the right side, sometimes the soft palate, sometimes nothing at all). Yesterday, after being very stressed out about some work things, the pain came back in the right side of my throat pretty strong. This morning I woke up and now the left side is hurting and I have a ton of mucus insiste my nose too.

Could my brain really be making all of this up? Does anyone suffer from throat pain from health anxiety?

Sorry for the reassurance post guys, I’m just really tired of thinking about all this and I never google anything because I feel like I’ll start feeling everything I read.",6.228488194973345,7.124335915841591,5.658118811881187,82.17237242955066,66.07920792079209,8.789642041127191,29.3998476770754,8.841846274778883,2.2084268088347287,853,28,158,13,13,260,119,202,0.183,0.7070000000000001,0.11,-0.9509,1,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,3,7,12,0,1,11,0,14,14,6,2,4,22,27,8,1,1,2,0,3,1,0,0,8,1,0,2,9,8,0,0,4,1,0,4,1,8,0,2,8,6,16,4,26,15,6,41,0,3,0,0,6,20,0,1,17,97,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825573177250504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2026040454150188,0.0,0.0,0.061728089849460314,0.0,0.07264769626561003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06788259796570803,0.0,0.05381524508873365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09855073163380083,0.0,0.10096988353873716,0.0,0.09068884931283896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07048515163472965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09101377858653792,0.0,0.0,0.09162168384574187,0.09223479858781064,0.0,0.0,0.07725525047407826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07934122158351871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08927499735675856,0.06306792522884504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17482403145545786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2815155511448707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09450657821392316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19183501156263996,0.09027324816868967,0.0,0.04312961081348878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05892821675014698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09382867413901594,0.06489665280615907,0.0,0.06808770765142776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08470794832443733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28181145139968194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09223479858781064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454874284832059,0.2694403779698522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08830483575161999,0.0,0.1131100687230954,0.0,0.08716678356039495,0.0,0.0,0.1507828904933418,0.0,0.07020455133763925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14605382106324324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34924845043793473,0.09882329101452364,0.2499428309102545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1011255249993422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917577047256291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20191391027776004,0.0,0.058649937584033814,0.05656686535952265,0.0,0.07008520978780243,0.0,0.10146596040048464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623765620034572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21852307712874952,0.0,0.0,0.2832545983803886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06426957987163234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Wanderer470,2019/02/24,"Its funny how HA works Lately we've had a small problem with rats behind one of our walls at home. We through some poison into the hole in which they climb. No biggie.

So today my dog was being more friendly and excited than usual. My fiance and I spent some time playing with her since he was in such a good mood. She licked my face a ton while we were playing (the dog, not my fiance lol).

5 minutes after she calmed down, my fiance eventually said ""did she catch a rat or something?"". Instantly I realized that if she did, she might have been poisoned by the poisoned rat and her licking could have poisoned me. I was fine until I thought of that. Suddenly I got dizzy and nauseous. 

HA works like that. Unless we have the idea, we don't worry about our health. Our symptoms are caused from our overactive brains. But I'm sure you knew this already. Just thought I'd give more evidence of irrational behavior.

healthanxiety,echh-r,2019/02/24,"Scared of bad diseases and death in the young ages Hello everyone
I'm a medical student (22 y/o) and it's about 2 year that I'm suffering from anxiety about my health. 

I think about my body and symptoms  
almost every hour of the day. I'm always scared about that i have a bad disease and will it kill me or something.

I usually experience physical symptoms and I can't really find out whether this symptoms are real or only because of my anxiety.
Over the past 2 years, I experienced lots of symptoms all over my body (now I'm experiencing stomach problems and sleep problems) visited lots of doctors and took lots of medicine. Now its for a few months that i started to feel depressed and lost my motivations. Don't now what to do at all.

I will be happy if you share some ideas.

healthanxiety,ohnoitisigod,2019/02/24,I'm freaking out Yesterday I was hanging out with my buddy things haven't been good for either of us. I told him how two people that I knew died this week and my great aunt tested positive for cancerous cells . His birthday is coming up and he saw how depressed I was and wanted to smoke weed with me. I haven't smoked weed in a while and said screw it we were smoking I went to the bathroom I come out and find out his mom took a hit. Now I didn't know this and I know they smoke together my HA has been under control but unfortunately Now my mind is running all over the place panicking worrying about diseases. Now I'm not saying they have diseases I can't stop worrying about it. For example we were using a bowl and a bong we were passing to each other now I'm worrying about shit like Hepatitis or HIV and stuff like that. Again I'm not saying they have because when I did smoke with them before I was perfectly fine but my HA won't stop me from over thinking and going worst case scenario.,3.6789705882352948,4.880140328431374,4.579686274509808,86.45158823529414,72.18627450980392,7.792941176470588,26.345098039215685,8.238735603445708,1.5453415686274514,793,26,165,12,15,257,118,204,0.161,0.703,0.136,-0.6978,0,0,4,0,0,0,8.0,4,0,4,2,11,13,2,0,6,2,19,4,1,4,2,43,38,16,1,1,6,2,0,2,0,1,2,3,0,0,9,22,0,3,5,0,0,8,7,5,0,1,16,4,30,8,23,20,4,29,0,1,1,2,19,10,2,1,13,115,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938186578994626,0.0,0.13096125876022865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.265149924622715,0.0,0.0,0.17261680539356009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13255758354656993,0.0,0.15972840779082378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14066577963316326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874673838238016,0.12908765944608114,0.0,0.16968007948929373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16916360194084035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15037977419133902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15539951140347405,0.18025090430480456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10669789181566088,0.0,0.16079727967172708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14639827220883678,0.24478181876050345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1579805945641773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25734184122595616,0.0,0.0,0.17618364936868622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224720561893816,0.09861568744803607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470621934303208,0.17099338593444569,0.0,0.0,0.15034217816478015,0.0,0.18512797270686507,0.13292393626058185,0.0,0.0,0.09077676795638152,0.0,0.12345277913387592,0.0,0.0,0.14267086618244404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4688919875112837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,TMThrowaway99,2019/02/25,"Scared of Crohn's Disease I had a canker sore in my mouth two weeks ago, it has healed now but I just thought ""what if it comes back"". I have no idea if I have had this feeling for a long time but just now noticed it that I kinda feel like the roof of my mouth is burning and it stops when I don't pay attention to it. I have always had some problems with my stomach, they have gotten better in last two years (male, 19 y/o now). I have had a gastroscopy before but never gotten a colonoscopy because that makes me anxious. Gastroscopy showed that I have no reflux and everything looks good, biopsies from my duodenum came back normal, no coeliac disease or other diseases. I just can't stop worrying if I have an IBD and that is what is causing my mouth symptoms. Would Crohn's disease show on the biopsies taken from my duodenum? I just feel like it would be real unlikely because no-one in my family never have had an IBD and I don't smoke (Apparently smokers are twice as likely to develop Crohn's than non-smokers).

healthanxiety,nomdeguere,2019/02/25,"Lumps on neck and head now. Okay so first of all thank you for reading this, I am struggling with bad anxiety right now. 

I have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. I was put on antibiotics (which didn't seem to help) and sent away. I recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound (which I have yet to go to) to make sure they weren't cancer. I have zero symptoms otherwise.

 Fast forward to now I have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go.  It's larger than the other two and is  hard and hurts a little when I apply pressure. 

There are a few causes I can think of 

1. It's just a cyst, and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. My fathet has a history of cysts, which may account for mine.

2. I'm pretty sure I remember hitting my head on something about a week ago, so it could just be a bruise of sorts. (memory isn't clear)

3. Cancer. I'm gonna die, hit the panic button, ect...

4. I recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. 


This is the way my anxious mind sees it: I must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two I've had for years. I've left it untreated for so long that I'm scared to even go to a doctor. Now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. I will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action.

I'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality.

I'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thank you.

healthanxiety,lipstickvogue,2019/02/25,"HA with starting new medications A few years ago, I was placed on a mood stabilizer to treat BPD and the first night that I took it I got extremely dizzy, my heart rate spiked, and I spent the next two days in bed unable to think straight because everything was just fuzzy and I couldn't concentrate or find the energy to function.

Ever since, I've been *petrified* of starting new medications. A few times now, my psychiatrist has put me on something and I didn't even start taking it because I would take to the internet to double-check possible side effects and suddenly become too afraid to. I always worry starting something new, wondering if this one will have another frightening effect, if I'll have an allergic reaction, if it'll interfere with my heart condition, etc - basically, I always end up terrified to start taking something, because I'm convinced it will be dangerous, or at least will make me feel worse than whatever it's treating.

Today, after seeing my psychiatrist again, I've been given a new prescription, this time for Strattera to treat the ADHD I just got diagnosed with very recently. Strattera is the only/safest option for me right now, as stimulants definitely will aggravate my heart condition. But so many people online (I peeked around /r/ADHD and a few other places) say it made them feel absolutely horrible, with more side effects than benefits, and now I'm back to being terrified to take it.

healthanxiety,IncognitoRyan,2019/02/25,"'Ice-Pick Headaches / year long' Hey!

So I was wondering whether some of you could help me out. For the last year, I have been experiencing a weird sensation at the back/top of my head, the closest thing I can describe it to being an 'Ice-Pick Headache'. Originally, I was having it a few times a week, and I would get these sensations a few times a day, lasting only 2-5 seconds. However, this has now reduced to once a week on average. During the last year, I have been to the doctors about this issue a few times, mentioning the almost 'pinching' sensation that occurs. However, on none of these occasions have any follow-up appointments been scheduled, each doctor suggesting there is absolutely nothing to worry about and suggesting they could be a symptom of anxiety or tension. For a few months, it hasn't worried me as much but has been in the back of my head (quite literally!), and I decided to make another appointment for today. Again, I was told the same thing, but was prescribed with an anti-inflammatory medicine.

Have any of you experienced similar symptoms, and do you have any advice?

healthanxiety,ppptub,2019/02/25,"Freaking out over HIV So a little over a year ago I was hooking up with this guy. We had unprotected sex (vaginal and anal). I had gotten sick twice with flu like symptoms during the brief few months we hooked up. I also had to get surgery to remove an ovary due to a cyst and they did all the general blood work then and everything looked fine. Fast forward to two weeks ago, I had a swollen lymph node but didn’t feel sick. Ignored it. I woke up this morning to a rash on my breast and I don’t know where it came from. It doesn’t hurt or itch it’s just red. I went to urgent care this morning and she told me I was fine and couldn’t feel my lymphnodes but to come back in three days if the rash doesn’t go away. I had just gotten another general health panel done on my blood a month ago and was told I was completely healthy. Well after doing research I found out that general health panels don’t screen for HIV. So now I’m freaking out. I had the lymphnode, and now the rash and I think I have tongue thrush. Not severe or anything but my tongue definitely looks whiter than usual. I’m going to get tested this week but I’m so fucking scared. I feel like an idiot for not knowing that general health panels don’t screen for STIs.  I haven’t lost a significant amount of weight or but I do sleep a lot more but I thought that was just from my depression/anxiety. I’m terrified ",1.8566184141888369,3.8912434542253536,2.9298278560250384,92.79180229525299,79.24647887323944,6.320083463745438,21.786124152321335,7.3871296695380915,0.6152455920709445,1087,32,239,15,27,347,151,284,0.173,0.725,0.102,-0.9758,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,2,0,1,2,12,14,2,1,15,0,24,24,9,0,1,50,53,24,0,2,15,0,4,2,0,0,13,0,0,1,11,18,1,2,8,0,0,8,10,8,1,3,24,9,28,6,30,28,5,39,0,2,5,5,7,15,1,5,20,149,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3275997068580013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09851445733502484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129174746553826,0.09423949513962536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10137431666436653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157404243838306,0.09472498559370224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408957678437155,0.1255997252412076,0.0,0.0,0.10611669409383072,0.12916166170390253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794469223293243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12606544815424772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107146204875979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18686466985475567,0.08800647717909904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13507073454415786,0.0,0.11388654434348995,0.12872267394368184,0.0,0.14002266265962765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12197679786369438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928334702226934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318767184536202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13540326081185589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12036816166150685,0.12346806494189845,0.0,0.0,0.2068960110943273,0.0,0.13447569855051744,0.1047311573768046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966570851249077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12333400317336853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13916887088092306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12327828915487732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12804087525697197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07893474420305051,0.0,0.09779856231835576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354253551490724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033806875421928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13567563555719472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19763008896983056,0.15001140838109514,0.1107619960886539,0.1141977368790643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968329453933227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07932988528385235

healthanxiety,janalbead,2019/02/25,"Convinced something is wrong with my head/brain I posted this to r/askdocs already but figured l'd share here too.

I'll start by saying l got diagnosed with severe GAD anxiety about a year ago, and l've noticed l've become a huge hypochondriac since then. Lately l've been noticing a few things that have me convinced there's something wrong.

One is that when l run my hand over my head l feel a lot of hard bumps/divits on my skull that l don't remember always being there, and l haven't hit my head recently. I know it's normal to have a few small bumps, but I have one on the top of my head that seems out of the ordinary and l don't know if that should be of concern or not.

The other is that I will randomly get sharp bursts of pain in isolated areas of my head that feel like bad headaches, but only last for like a minute or so. This has been scaring me into thinking l might have brain problems/tumors. I also will feel ""shakey"" but it's only in my head and not all over. I sometimes will get slight numbing/tingling sensations on my head, ears, and side of face. 
Like l mentioned before, l have anxiety so l know some of these could just be anxiety related issues/symptoms, but it seems like something is wrong to me. I don't want to waste my money in getting scans of my brain if unnecessary, but I still am concerned.
I'm a 21 year old female, overall healthy besides the anxiety and mild depression. Any feedback or concerns would be greatly appreciated!",6.488741379310348,6.106473693103451,6.574612068965517,80.20846982758623,65.51724137931035,9.594827586206897,33.297413793103445,9.017664075816787,2.6754999999999995,1161,44,229,17,16,371,157,290,0.149,0.715,0.136,-0.4832,0,0,3,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,1,11,15,0,1,11,0,28,14,12,0,1,45,45,22,0,7,14,0,6,4,0,6,2,2,0,0,15,10,0,0,11,0,1,1,6,7,0,2,3,9,22,8,28,30,5,28,0,1,1,0,3,15,0,11,15,141,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372854056432204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178433822798024,0.06651404453434863,0.06920725070086631,0.0,0.0,0.056561024861907214,0.0,0.254510866574424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06944663496694133,0.0,0.09185890913194897,0.07077476363396862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785483484850317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06640749813177807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716374577658508,0.08441963935563498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12616549193736107,0.05941936747917888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13036460686405002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06652167265392178,0.09169938982668653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07450737292954743,0.0,0.5975220818315157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13713040852127534,0.0677977345272063,0.0938236504691155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16253803719476428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07071137632321912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882342403423761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08149264826473046,0.0,0.1893878073438536,0.08727689434095721,0.0,0.11272141637123967,0.1265148204583781,0.08850276972432608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07965749313898841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08212407694655355,0.0,0.09421968283103696,0.0,0.0,0.0661431309101344,0.08327146696626382,0.0,0.0,0.15143657723528495,0.0,0.09396270076471,0.0,0.06880221312184437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920937258919435,0.08226099852978097,0.0,0.058870831982951274,0.0,0.06642269086242593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08644940762447195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055256965902894806,0.0532944019919246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04905805240717208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05908426935424828,0.27281242592275595,0.0,0.10712237909874678

healthanxiety,jasuschristsuperstar,2019/02/26,"Thought it might be helpful - what symptoms has your HA given you? I have seen so many helpful posts about people saying theyve had xyz from anxiety that people are fearing something serious so thought it might be useful to share the symptoms we thought were SOMETHING but that turned out to be anxiety - sorry if one exists I couldn’t find one 

Mine are

Muscle twitches and hand tremors
Lightheaded ness
Dizzy
Feeling of feeling balance
Weird pressure in my ears
Insomnia
Or super deep sleep where I wake up feeling exhausted
Feeling “outside” myself
Feeling shaky and weak
Feeling sick
Feeling fatigued 

Apparently my slight blurry vision (most prevalent when reading text on the tv - it kind of ghosts a little) is down to anxiety too but that’s the one I’m obsessing about at the the moment and not quite convinced on!

Can anyone else relate to this?",6.0813821138211335,7.848253073170731,5.713170731707318,78.4438211382114,67.04878048780488,7.90569105691057,35.61788617886179,8.344100000000001,3.124091056910569,360,18,58,5,6,111,55,82,0.239,0.7340000000000001,0.028,-0.9581,0,0,2,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,1,0,1,6,1,2,2,0,5,3,2,1,0,6,11,4,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,0,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,4,7,1,9,9,0,3,0,2,1,0,1,3,0,3,1,35,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14454348425343533,0.0,0.0,0.2642314421177505,0.3871958454304898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2109266786390466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3156809560976181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12479731988576835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948667969129494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996322529663152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09230967045163724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13099164810363648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3783366309250752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16009367757158868,0.29092035052553444,0.18687282795737611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21629843108418376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1282822076450062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16318903013827551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,arnimara,2019/02/26,"Terrified of ALS/MS or some kind of serious neurological condition I am a 24-year-old male. I'm overweight but otherwise healthy as of a full physical with CBC 6 months ago. I usually go for a walk for about a half hour during my lunch break. I guess about 3 weeks ago, I went out and I felt very tired after a few minutes. My legs were burning and I felt like I had to like drag them. After that I freaked out about what could be wrong with me. Since then, I dread lunchtime because I go for a walk, feel tired, and get very anxious afterwards as a result. The whole time I'm walking I'm thinking I'm going to collapse, or I'm not going to be able to make to back to the office, etc. Today I went out and my left leg felt worse than my right, which is why I started to fear ALS, because I readf It affects one limb worse than the other. The muscle in the front of my calf was burning so much I felt like I had to drag it. The whole afternoon I sat at my desk flexing my legs and it feels like the right one is stronger. I know I'm out of shape and need to lose weight, but I've never had problems like this before as a result of my anxiety. I'm going to make an appointment to go to the doctor tomorrow morning, but I'm the meantime I'm just imagining hearing I have ALS and only have a few years to live.

healthanxiety,ProTreaty,2019/02/26,"I don’t understand why my sickness won’t go away. I’m starting to think I might have neck or throat cancer. Two months ago I went to the doctor due to a cough and a caught up stuffy head I’ve had for literally 2-3 months straight. The doctor gave me decongestants and antibiotics to tackle infections. 1 month later I still have the cough, and I developed really bad mouth ulcers which made it extremely difficult to eat or even talk, along with a lump developing under my jaw which was supposedly a swollen lymph node. I got a blood test taken. I also had constant tiredness. 

I got acid reflux then in between all of this which I also got medicine for. It’s cured now.

I got prescribed medicine again and I got rid of the ulcers and the soreness in my mouth. The lump under my jaw disappeared, and my blood tests said I was perfectly fine, but I still don’t feel right. Another lump has just grown on the right side of my neck this time, and my cough and stuffy head is STILL effecting me. I’m really starting to worry that this might be something very serious. Why can’t I just become fully healthy? It’s been months, almost 4 months now. I’m going back to the doc again on Friday and this time I’m going to tell her my concerns.

healthanxiety,RadikaleZentristin,2019/02/26,"Itchy Skin and Lymph Nodes. Google Results Are F***** Scaring Me. Hey Guys! I’m new to this SubReddit, but I found myself worrying about minor medical issues since I was a young teenager (I’m 24).
I have three small hard lymph nodes in the back of my neck and behind my ear. Since five days my skin is itchy without an apparent rash. 
I called my GP and went to the ER three days ago. Dr. just told me the lymph nodes are fine but didn’t address my itchiness, even though he asked where I feel it. When I googled my symptoms I started crying (lymphoma, blood cancer etc.). I’m married and have a son and also I’m a student and workout and live actually quiet healthy compared to most people I know. I have no other symptoms but I’m sure I have cancer. The lymph nodes came after I was sick about three weeks ago. 
Did anyone else have similar symptoms?
I have an appointment with my Dr. in 8 days but I’m just so ridden with anxiety..

healthanxiety,fnars,2019/02/26,"Dealing with health anxiety for years... and how Im learning to move on from it Im no expert and I know everyone is different but I’ve come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what I learned.  
(On mobile, excuse format and typos)

I once read something along the lines of “our brain believes everything we tell it, so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety, we create a world that is simply not true” 

A year ago and I was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death, I worried about brain cancer, breast cancer, blood cloths, etc etc etc. 

Im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and Im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me, this is kind of how I learned to deal with it (again, I know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone) 

1. If I can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety, I call them “sensations” because any little thing I feel I wanna convince myself is pain even if its not. I try to ignore it if thats the case. My doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious.

2. If its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on, (eg., you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that) 

3. If over the counter meds don’t do it and its well over a week or so then I’ll call my Doctor explain whats going on and see if I can come in for some answers and peace of mind. 

If you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap. But the main thing is, breathe friend. Don’t freak out immediately, don’t google about it, try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that, thoughts and sensations and nothing more, they’re not a sign of anything. 

Ironically, life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what, but looking for symptoms constantly means you’re wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately. 

Think about that, I do it everyday.

healthanxiety,ThrowingMercy,2019/02/26,"Scared to Death about my eyes I’ve been having eye floaters that I can’t seem to ignore, mostly when I go outside or look at a bright surface. I get super anxious about them, but really I only notice them if I start to look. 

I went to my optometrist last Friday and he said that everything looked normal in my eyes at the time. But when I get anxious about them a lot I feel like I notice little pin pricks of light in my vision and other symptoms, but no loss of peripheral vision. 

I had pink eye at the beginning of this year and I think that may have been the culprit of these floaters, cause they only really became visible after then, but I just need some reassurance that everything is fine and will be fine.

I've been kinda lazy these past few years and would like to start exercising again as i fell it would help me feel better.
However I'm very anxious about my heart, do you know of a fitbit lke device that can track steps/calories consumed etc. without measuring heart rate ?

healthanxiety,HearIAm07,2019/02/27,"How to stop nervous ticks/compulsions? So not totally related to health anxiety, but for me, these nervous ticks occur when I’m stressed about health, dying, etc. or just anxious in general. 

I have 2 “nervous ticks.” I just can’t stop myself from doing them. I wouldn’t worry about them so much but people point them out to me because 1 is pretty noticeable. And the other 1 is a bit self-destructive because I pick at my eyebrow....to the point where my hair falls out. I can’t stop though.

healthanxiety,cypherinium,2019/02/27,"any advice for someone who's scared of taking an ultrasound and its test results? hello! 

this coming saturday, im going to have to have a whole abdomen ultrasound to check why ive been feeling nasty symptoms in the upper (stomach) and lower (large intestine? uterus?) abdomen for about 6 weeks now.

my initial fear was that i was pregnant... 3 negative test results later + even having my period, i still doubt myself -- what if that wasnt a period? what if the pain ive been feeling on the lower side is actually a baby?

though maybe... the lower pain is from the constipation and how im having trouble with my digestive system (i...really want to, for the lack of a better term, poop now) maybe high levels of stress can cause that? someone please enlighten me. haha

my grandmother is accompanying me on saturday because she knows the doctor. i have 2 fears:
1) what if im pregnant? -- illogical, at this point. but i fear that the worse outcome will happen and i dont want my grandmother to know first... ive actually been really conscious of my abdominal area, i keep looking at it in the mirror and nowadays i feel full and sometimes there's a pain somewhere.

2) what if i have an illness i never even thought of? -- i really dont want to die yet, or have cancer...

maybe im asking for advice on what to do to rationalize these thoughts? and how to not freak out as the saturday draws nearer?

So I’ve been away for a while from this sub trying to sort myself out. I had a massive colon cancer scare end of 2017/ beginning of 2018 which subsided after numerous tests at doctors. However, I’ve recently started worrying again - I use the toilet about 3 times a day. Have urgency to go. Sometimes have flat stools - worried it’s colon cancer and I’ve had it for 18+ months :/

healthanxiety,Dog-Days54,2019/02/27,"Intense body aches from aftermath of a common cold So basically 8 days ago, I caught the common cold and was hit with the usual 3 - sore throat, cough and runny nose. During the course of the sickness, I experienced sweating at night and joint pains. Fast forward to today, I no longer have the 3 symptoms, I might even add that I feel recovered! However, the oddity is that the body aches and joint pains still lingers as if I was sick and it has been affecting my sleep. If I were to describe the pain, it feels like it's my entire body with the most painful part being my rib/torso area. I was wondering if this is normal? Any thoughts?  


I might add that during the course of the sickness, I coughed really heavily and battled pretty bad yellow phlegm production (loads of it) so my uneducated ass might think that the pain stems from me ""overworking"" myself?

healthanxiety,redcapris,2019/02/28,"anxiety about having a personality disorder Recently I've become obsessed with the possibility of having borderline personality disorder. I have a decent amount of the associated symptoms, but I also have bipolar disorder which complicates things. I've been hospitalized for mania so I'm pretty confident that's not a misdiagnosis, my worry is I have BPD on top of it.

I now spend hours reading the criteria for BPD, taking BPD symptom tests over and over again, reading accounts of BPD on medical/mental health subreddits, to see if my experiences fit. It's even more hellish than health anxiety I've had about physical health problems because there is no definitive test, one professional could say I have it and the other could disagree for example, there is no objective qualification for whether I ""have"" it and I'm scared to even bring it up to a professional because I don't want to plant the seed in their mind and be treated worse because it's so highly stigmatized. It's gotten completely obsessive. I'm really unsure of what to do.

Does anyone else struggle with this? ,4.32089552238806,5.773870940298513,5.4867462686567166,79.59220895522391,70.94029850746269,8.345074626865673,25.34029850746269,8.841846274778883,1.869062089552239,271,8,51,5,5,90,55,67,0.23,0.677,0.093,-0.8658,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,2,3,0,6,3,0,0,0,8,10,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,1,0,6,2,9,8,3,8,0,0,0,1,2,4,0,2,2,37,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894760565050623,0.27765182409525363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2992769729632441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371370998169187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2263696636393077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17898024432549306,0.0,0.0,0.2589337404165672,0.0,0.0,0.2554565553132486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20935907236732887,0.0,0.14157626913020746,0.0,0.15400461756800474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.271815808889544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303781621190348,0.24457072666237625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30549010499155194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2296011288780669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2832879392861701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15801106741114535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,WeaselGuy,2019/02/28,"Weird, I'm fine. So over the last week or so I've had some symptoms. My tongue was sensitive and burned. Mild aching in my jaw. Cheek was kind of torn up and raw. My SO was leaving across the country for a week when these symptoms showed up. They got worse until she got back. So things have died down then yesterday I sort of run my jaw on the right side. Sure as shit, there's a mass or lump of some sort. I go into full panic mode through my whole work shift and into the night. In all lasting about 7 or 8 hours. So I call the dentist this morning. Get fit in somewhere. It's about an hour drive for me to get there. Nerves going crazy the whole time. Thinking the worst case scenario as usual. I go in, I get into a room. They take some xrays. The assistant says hes going to get the doc and he'll be back. At this point to me its mouth cancer or some crazy abcess. The doc comes in, I explain my HA to him.  He looks around a bit and God damn. It's a fucking canker sore. My lymphnodes are a tad swollen and that's what he said I felt. I could tell they were trying not to laugh at the fool who'd just spent 100 dollars to look at a canker sore. Honestly it is funny though and hella relieving. Just a good ol case of the HA. Keep on powering through folks. It's usually never as bad as it seems.

healthanxiety,witchblade_007,2019/02/28,"my neck is constantly cracking! so my neck has been constantly cracking for a long time now, but now its even more frequent than it used to be. 

i can also MOVE bits and pieces in the back of my neck, which feels like small pieces of bone. 

i saw a doctor for this, she basically diagnosed me as overly anxious about my health, that it is all a mental thing. i agree in this because i AM always anxious about my health.

when my neck cracks, which is with many movements, not just occasionally but VERY frequently, i dont really feel any pain but it does worry me a lot.

my neck cracking gets worse when i am in certain positions or if i sit down on a chair for a long time.

sometimes with the pains i feel, like sharp stabbing pains occasionally in my head or wherever it may be, i am starting to feel overly anxious about them because i wonder if it could be because of my neck.

im only 17 but i have very bad posture and a sedentary lifestyle for many years now.

i am mostly concerned about the bits and pieces that i can shift in the back of my neck, they feel like tiny pieces of bone and i can move them around. everyone ive asked about this does not relate to what im saying at all! 

i also get headaches nearly every day, i have a bit of scoliosis, and tmj, so i wonder if this is related at all.

i just dont feel like this is normal, and its really making me anxious lately, so if anyone else experiences constant cracking and crunching in their neck tell me! and are you able to move little pieces that feel like bone in the back of your neck? 

if anyone can help me alleviate this anxiety i will be extremely grateful!",6.606515837104072,5.718661430769231,6.933574660633488,79.40289592760182,65.46153846153845,9.862443438914028,31.733031674208146,9.007467420416297,2.403316742081448,1275,41,261,18,17,415,151,325,0.114,0.7979999999999999,0.08800000000000001,-0.8682,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,2,4,0,22,10,0,0,13,0,28,20,13,2,4,46,44,27,0,7,15,0,8,5,0,2,7,1,0,0,20,11,0,0,9,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,2,10,42,6,39,35,14,43,0,0,1,0,11,17,0,12,26,189,62,1,0.07669549634965662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12266672144300154,0.0638167969110276,0.0,0.0,0.05215556751840068,0.0,0.058671844782682385,0.3465763214800321,0.0,0.10725454861358463,0.07858359946466165,0.0,0.0682752521406743,0.07169993595595286,0.0,0.0,0.17692230768727832,0.06403753587894058,0.14025858813867104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511948541632739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2486417549391986,0.0,0.06123511306586375,0.0,0.0,0.04946225028542176,0.0,0.0,0.07784431436738627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850109038031783,0.13423349139482774,0.0,0.17977310104709246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06406924584899798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050656652006495,0.0,0.06461926352421946,0.07328583347538696,0.0,0.07502291214188085,0.0,0.0,0.27145683177345525,0.2739563895833974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801404627056405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07871170590598027,0.16304745235317744,0.0,0.0,0.05140737453149668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16568859414176024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865158605030937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873477273864146,0.07686903597219348,0.0,0.13574620160584952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06520376833957417,0.0,0.0,0.05119483936368517,0.15551439092880065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729102134719612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2445455249708961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07514530242691768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05833038100534148,0.2448282466517656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09826619772402696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0609913370290654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758538069885741,0.0,0.05428546706584028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06703524430044014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05095307984688479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944352138065688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0662402839945504,0.0,0.12656363338124846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16634598836073372,0.0,0.07788799943106313,0.078159263059862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04938938508855733
healthanxiety,Lady-Bear,2019/02/28,"Tell me your success stories Quick Bio:
My Dad was diagnosed with MS when I was 23, shortly after having my first baby. It rocked my world. I saw the strongest man in my life quickly deteriorating and it hit me that illnesses happen to young people. This kicked off health anxiety for me and I’ve been struggling ever since. I’ve been convinced that I’ve had MS, Parkinson’s, neuro diseases. lots of various cancers. I’m a compulsive ‘checker’ if I feel a lump or bump. I check it constantly. I’ve had panic attacks that last for days. Most of these symptoms have always gone away with starting and restarting ssri’s.  Basically, my anxiety has given me symptoms that mimic diseases. My mind is obviously not healthy, as if I even hear the word cancer, I can feel the anxiety build. If people I know are going through something health related, or even if I see a young person going through cancer treatment, it triggers it. It’s even branching to my kids. Every headache or complaint, I start panicking about something worse than a headache or virus. I can’t sleep, I obsess and they’re starting to notice my compulsions and worries. It’s entirely illogical and overall just really bad for my health. I don’t want to live like this. I hate being on SSRI’s. I have sexual side effects and I don’t feel like myself. I think they help, but even on them I’m susceptible to panic over things. 

I’ve tried meditating, medications, yoga, exercise. I’ve overhauled my diet. I lift weights and cardio 3x a week. I use CBD oil. 

My question: is this a life long thing? Has anyone overcome this and lived more normally? Has therapy helped you? And if so, how? I just don’t see how talking about it will help. How have you overcome this? I’m so tired.

healthanxiety,Meriland31,2019/02/28,"Hypochondria as an early symptom of dementia? I decided to take a break from scaring myself to death with medical craziness online and (for once) actually wanted to learn about Hypochondria (I guess you could say it was an eye opening moment where I, myself, saw myself from a logical standpoint). 

As I sifted through the Google pages, I ended up coming across a slew of articles relating to Hypochondria being one of the earliest signs of Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia and Lewy Body Dementia. My first initial reaction was complete anger. I had abused my Google privileges for so long, looking at the scariest possible diseases. The one time I do exactly what people have been telling me to do (""dude, look up what ANXIETY does to your body and mind, not this"") I get forced back into hell. 

As you can imagine, I checked it out. There were actually many articles and case reports regarding it that it kinda scared me. I had been worried specifically about dementia for the past month for a bunch of odd-and-end reasons..and then Google relays the term in reference to my hypochondria/anxiety...? It is the coincidence now that is flipping me out and confirming my fear even more. That is some bizarre..not even intentional coincidence, dont you think? 

How do you even distinguish the difference between hypochondria as a VERY early symptom of dementia vs hypochondria because you are a hypochondriac?",9.000474238875873,9.611533930327873,8.278454332552695,66.75237704918034,60.106557377049185,12.053395784543323,41.60889929742389,11.629938488055165,5.315163700234192,1125,59,173,31,14,353,147,244,0.13,0.85,0.02,-0.9805,0,0,0,0,1,0,38.0,0,6,0,1,11,6,2,3,16,0,19,6,3,2,1,30,28,12,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,11,11,0,0,7,0,1,1,2,5,0,3,8,5,26,1,36,18,5,25,1,0,4,0,8,10,1,3,13,130,37,2,0.0,0.15869627632632674,0.2614110491256777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20492653491361307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10299112404358156,0.0,0.08164820953330912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2975529377083376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11537692548605817,0.1404329030914749,0.0,0.0,0.10693970491392027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13993815598057585,0.0,0.0,0.11721126360857853,0.0,0.1569759686469296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2372610901013748,0.0,0.0,0.2653971134996537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507190521687681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11392877750608135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997780361888305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14754933957502014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11853214615037234,0.2249507097750857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13579351978909746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13492984522810825,0.0,0.0,0.13524060301567573,0.0,0.10690914398774597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426410800366155,0.18152159535206314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12786030420515268,0.09285670913202576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150996538515575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1065139796047784,0.26819339248259305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784286233159648,0.10070575302001952,0.0,0.1170689312945503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858229534753843,0.0,0.0,0.0781011359660698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11051402478890306,0.07900092302324094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13602195306693668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Regular_Personality,2019/02/28,"How do i cope ? Actually so glad i came across this sub after checking reddit for similar symptoms...

22 year old male, and i go to the doctors a few times a month with a new issue, my doctors laughs when he calls my name out and sees me walk down, we do have a good relationship now tho, i think he enjoys seeing me as it lightens his mood .

Recently started TRT after symptoms of low T got really bad, i just saw a urologist today about a lump in my scrotum ( harmless cyst apparently ) 

I saw my doctors recently about a swollen lymph node in my neck, ultrasound booked for next week, i started to feel better about it, until my mum just saw me feeling it, and said my uncle had the same thing and its leukemia! Apparently it wont effect him till his old but what the hell !

Straight down the rabbit hole, googling away... heart pumping, i bet i have leukemia, im certain, i don’t know what else it could be...

I have NO symptoms of why it could be swollen, and the worst thing is i don’t really know how long its been like that for, i just felt it while rubbing my neck one day, about the size of a cashew..

healthanxiety,harpyize,2019/02/28,"Oh boy a swollen lymph node. I spent five years absolutely convinced my ibs was a sign of some horrible bowel cancer. Kept putting off any screening (colonoscopy) for fear of the procedure and for fear I’d be right. Finally got it done and woo nothings wrong! Turns out my anxiety was actually 90% of the cause behind horrible intestinal upset for yeaaars. So that subsides (finally) and I can get back to normal. Til now. About a week ago I discovered a swollen (what I presume to be) a lymph node on my upper thigh/groin crease area. About the size of a grape, hard and moveable. Doesn’t hurt until I start messing with it. I’ve had a lymph node in my neck that swells up occasionally (happening since childhood apparently it’s normal) and it feels like that. So cool guess I’m going right back down into the anxiety that I’m gonna die.

healthanxiety,LaJardinera,2019/02/28,"Anxiety over tests Hi there, aside from therapy, wondering if any of you could share advice about how to get over anxiety when doing medical tests. 

I recently had an ultrasound and was in tears during it bc I had convinced myself that something scary would be found. It was to the point that the radiologist came to talk to me and gave me the results on the spot. I greatly appreciated this but I understand is not possible every time. 

I have a follow up MRI scheduled for next week (likely to confirm an incidentaloma) and I’m having a VERY hard time. I’ve rescheduled it twice and I dread the two days I will have to wait for the results. The anxiety is crippling. 

Thanks for reading and any advice you can give me.

healthanxiety,CrypticWriter,2019/03/01,"Twitching, anxiety, stress For the past 2 or 3 months (at least) I've been having muscle twitching all over my body. Feet, lower legs, thighs, quads, back, stomach, face (especially my right eye). 

I tried to do some guided relaxation the other night and found that over about 25 minutes of this relaxation I only had 2 or 3 twitches.

Still I worry that it's ALS or something.

On top of the twitching my legs feel sore and my muscles feel tight/fatigued. Taking to a friend I'm told that your body releases some hormones when you're stressed that can make muscles tighten.

I don't have any real weakness. I can still do pushups, run, etc.

I don't really know.

So I've been having Health Anxiety, mostly due to the apparition of a dark spot in my stomach, and some sores in my scalp. Initially I didn't worry about it, but it started spreading, and I was convinced that it was some cancer tumor. That coupled with upset stomach made me live day after day with anxiety about my health. It's been two months with this anxiety, I've been to the doctor and he said I have a healthy stomach, besides my colon being upset and having a infection. I'm on medication for that. Been to two different dermatologist for the spot in my chest, said it was dermatitis and got medication for it. Still, I'm anxious about my health, and been feeling dizzy lately.

healthanxiety,skysamfreeman,2019/03/01,"More anxious when on meds that are helping you? I don't mean anxiety meds. I'm dealing with Crohn's and have recently had an iron infusion and my first round of Entyvio. Since then I've been feeling some new things (most likely side effects) and I've been paranoid about them being something else. Since I had the iron infusion I've been having night sweats every night. Not drenching but kind of muggy and enough to notice that something's off. Then I started the Entyvio and my appetite has taken a plunge as well as nausea coming onto me at random points. Been more thirsty too. I feel feverish but only in my head. Extremities aren't cold and I'm not shivering but I do have chills (anxiety?). I keep getting paranoid about lymphoma since I used to be on Humira and that can cause it. Or maybe some kind of abdominal abscess forming. It's been taking over my thoughts and actions since this all started happening and I don't know if I'm thinking clearly. When I wasn't on anything for Crohn's I had no cares in the world it seemed and even though I had pain, I knew what was causing it. It wasn't something I thought about. Now it feels like I can't pinpoint what's doing what. Even talking to my doctor I feel like it's just brushed over as nothing. How do I go about not worrying about every thing I'm feeling?",3.7506075533661765,5.495711406130269,4.221893814997261,86.93034482758621,72.8697318007663,6.657252326217844,29.286808976464147,7.2636822038024595,1.6492257252326217,1051,44,204,11,21,331,143,261,0.052000000000000005,0.845,0.103,0.8947,0,0,3,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,1,2,15,8,0,0,5,0,27,4,2,5,2,45,54,24,0,1,9,0,6,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,16,12,0,1,13,0,0,3,10,1,1,1,16,8,24,7,26,36,8,28,0,0,1,0,5,13,0,7,15,138,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16660953402544912,0.12302093031146225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08961172614822631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11102622984746406,0.22373137063031534,0.0,0.0938038395107034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1122664891202198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145916867961543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909682253540986,0.0,0.0,0.1125181713304757,0.0,0.143848914540737,0.0,0.1834983274297122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2753042087449013,0.15558994806059506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262646509091173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056893409425877124,0.0,0.06188782777369184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09629593977086558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11175820951188443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07299036486656067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09679133264480293,0.0,0.22679583253482466,0.059846124376954475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1596025368361548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109400176245029,0.11861913409280207,0.2419167255250183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051719620314621,0.0,0.2043821185123928,0.0,0.10448817867636814,0.12397825977475115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08281994229790554,0.1158725002369967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10294145499406587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10752117877320053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991343823828512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3603179643348736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514992510208618,0.0,0.0,0.15415360477745005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818758712307336,0.08752608596832676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446906761138125,0.06977584573539633,0.10698928558320256,0.17290174222685115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940507571470032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097910141224323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110588676216417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,FastAsleepattheWheel,2019/03/01,"Coping Methods Backfired Hi all, just hoping to get some feedback on how to proceed. 

I got an IUD in mid January, and had my follow up ultra sound in February. 

A few weeks after getting the iud, I started feeling this strange twinge in my lower left pelvis. Of course, having gone through this countless times, I began to do what I’ve been working on with my counselor, which is essentially using mindfulness to talk myself off the ledge of thinking I was dying. 

I actually felt relatively calm while I was having my exam, but then my doctor tells me I have a complex cyst on my left ovary, and I felt anxiety come crashing down on me. 

The ultrasound was 2/7 of this year, and since that day, I can’t stop obsessing over this cyst, and I’m determined it’s cancer and that I’m dying. 

My doctor even said it was nothing to stress about, and that I’d have a follow up in 2 months to see if it’s changed/gone away. That hasn’t helped, and I’m still so scared. 

It’s too the point where I’m getting heart palpitations, and every twinge of my body makes me feel like my ovarian cancer has spread to wherever I’m feeling it. 

Anyone have any advice? I feel completely at a loss, because I feel like I can no longer rely on my coping method.",6.641782363977484,5.8682225528455305,7.0916260162601645,77.92319887429646,65.34146341463415,9.845653533458412,32.74421513445904,9.057496981413335,2.643857160725453,972,34,191,14,13,319,147,246,0.13699999999999998,0.787,0.076,-0.9606,1,0,2,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,2,8,8,0,3,9,0,17,9,3,3,1,30,45,14,2,2,3,0,7,2,0,0,6,2,0,0,15,10,0,1,9,0,0,4,3,4,0,0,12,10,26,4,31,33,3,38,0,1,1,0,5,21,0,3,15,121,41,5,0.0,0.0,0.12999227786521345,0.0,0.0,0.13016980192158836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09058634611784502,0.0,0.10190413587161988,0.0,0.0,0.0931424786049509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251537682239721,0.0,0.0,0.08120266359321643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1479646108592637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11474732538797253,0.13966657508274727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08590846073224917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2764987786974653,0.0,0.0,0.2726890831476764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08798295618608003,0.0,0.11223390425998148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3367710936600298,0.1903283542585662,0.25580209469235915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20878782567564366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10653900416547284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15785271074382112,0.08928684786484034,0.0,0.0,0.13230609456166134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2894628442857919,0.0,0.0,0.1301578863765978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08891770636778358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13450260885813406,0.0,0.10632575170841994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12781714586859474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12592508679527534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12671178542696246,0.0,0.13336494426618706,0.0,0.1061499258324928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11019144555364367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942856600507734,0.0,0.10638047806298974,0.11136826847343942,0.15258988365971626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10706794432862478,0.11643009809358465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08535462638399692,0.0,0.0,0.07767494604414489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11504937206862348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10685182156835353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09697737258258993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857819048867821

healthanxiety,Wav2me,2019/03/01,"I feel worse and worse by the day. Intense brain fog, feeling weak, chest (heart?) pain, very fatigued, and I have really bad circulation problems. Doctors don’t take me seriously. And I feel like maybe it’s all in my head, but yet I feel like my body is screaming “it’s not in your head” I’ve felt not well for years. I’ve gone to the doctor and they usually take one look at me and say I “look” young and healthy and it’s all good. They’ve never done any kind of tests on me unless I argued it. 
   I got an ECG last year for my heart and it was normal. But I have had pain in my heart area for over a year now, and it’s progressively worse.
   The last few months I have major brain fog, headaches, I feel extremely weak and my muscles in my chest and back have these weird.... things. They feel loose or.. I don’t know. They just hurt really badly sometimes. It feels like needles pulling them apart and it’s weird.

I just feel very unwell and every time I go to the doctor I feel Like they think I’m a hypochondriac. They don’t take me seriously and it feels so pointless. Maybe I say the wrong things to them, I don’t know. It’s so annoying. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve had chest X-rays, and all that. I don’t know :( I’m only 25, too.

healthanxiety,Avilus,2019/03/01,"Medical Radiation Question Hey, me again.

Is there a difference between a burst of radiation from a CT scan, and absorbing natural radiation from space over the course of a year?

I got a 3 mSv abdominal CT scan a few months ago. I've read the chances of developing cancer from the scan is 1 in 2000, yet they extrapolated this from victims exposed to radiation from the Fukushima reactor failure. Weren't those people exposed to the radiation over a long period of time? If so, doesn't that undermine the statistic?",5.2391489361702135,7.6400462659574515,6.943563829787233,66.20875000000001,70.38297872340425,11.082978723404254,36.21808510638297,10.9516,4.95055744680851,415,23,69,15,8,143,63,94,0.142,0.7879999999999999,0.07,-0.7709999999999999,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,1,0,4,1,1,0,13,0,4,2,0,0,0,3,5,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,3,3,0,15,3,1,12,0,0,3,0,3,4,0,2,8,45,6,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30507207586171003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.359568057630207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2752516815197273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3045657795000896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34669931174275065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2747007274550464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385933007804539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3855316476459227,0.0,0.344247493968731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20067917546326994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2216241248827454
healthanxiety,Lesplendide,2019/03/01,"Weird heartbeat - Anxiety symptom ? Hi guys, 

I am looking for someone that would have/had the same thing than I. 
I have been recently diagnosed with spasmophilia/severe anxiety (it all begin a month ago when i suddenly had a panic attack right before bed, and i am pretty sure it was heart related) 
I have been scared for a while to have any heart disease and i am obviously completely freaked out about sudden death (heart attack and stuff). 
I have been quite deep into anxiety, i could not walk without freaking out and my heart rate was going crazy ! 

I has dizziness, headaches, palpitations, nausea, tiredness, chest pain, blurry vision, heavy stomach feeling, pressure in my throat and neck, an oppressing feeling in my throat like i was suffocating, hot flash and short breath.

Doctors said : we found nothing, you are fine. 

Yeah but nothing stopped ... how can they tell me i have nothing when i feel so bad ? 

Anyway, back to other doctor : you have spasmophilia known as severe anxiety/stress. What happened ? I have no idea ...

My cardiologist gave me propanolol after running exams that all came back good ! 

I feel better yes, i can go to work, talk, walk. 
Nevertheless i still feel oppressed, i have shortbreath, crazy stomach pain (i think it is acid reflux but not sure), it feels like i am swallowing too much air, and i have those weird heart palpitations where all of a sudden it misses a beat and then burst in a new beat, it nearly cut my breath ! (But again cardiologist said i had nothing after an echograpghy and a 24h ECG). 

It needs to stop. Everytime i think i am getting better, something else appears and makes me feel down again. 

Sorry for the long post guys, but ill take any advise you ´ll have for me ! 

Thanks ",4.594365586490189,7.063074012779556,4.528109310816981,82.5085583067093,72.45047923322684,7.155134641716112,27.791989958922876,8.07648339933343,1.960606663623916,1358,52,238,21,28,418,183,313,0.198,0.6990000000000001,0.103,-0.9794,0,0,1,0,0,0,61.0,1,3,1,6,13,23,3,3,11,2,30,21,13,2,6,50,56,21,1,3,7,0,8,2,0,1,7,2,1,2,14,16,1,2,12,0,0,7,4,14,0,0,13,12,38,9,24,41,5,43,0,1,1,0,14,13,0,1,24,153,52,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301945040544139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120340893275065,0.0,0.1890473159094732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1874242990047656,0.0,0.12668081642784088,0.06877872637895736,0.0,0.0,0.07009408166188798,0.0,0.0,0.1457059576269026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09421374302566313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08636741749430682,0.0,0.0,0.06576881868633255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360772669569144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16862625775996687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881278408158639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2915548654392417,0.058847896941393835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09031867790909273,0.0,0.0,0.043036938263320584,0.0,0.09362991777166918,0.06909127957697557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16312613025780018,0.07284292603920152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4880670612615224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09299005329774357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804874072855589,0.0,0.0,0.07289826762604942,0.06917329001640816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05498518642669281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06575002345948898,0.0,0.06055425990819777,0.06107916813949338,0.0,0.07955718039498648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3161597338124256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17530317446041666,0.09664796789169998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889138080265806,0.08380382229205413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08761473211329228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08133424204240057,0.0,0.0,0.07034682025832155,0.15671279498241736,0.0,0.08247059694646709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861180138908168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06979509821399682,0.06341541635302997,0.0,0.09221078422875144,0.0,0.0,0.0657838652996735,0.13773645889383246,0.09435897013754703,0.0,0.09429835375168602,0.0,0.0,0.15527276292980885,0.08561797350522342,0.06193488579733403,0.06620898266180668,0.07199837817311731,0.0758387764362115,0.0,0.0,0.05472552759648803,0.1055636776030297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07940545463807963,0.0,0.05996914594905189,0.0,0.0,0.058516021649586324,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,doyalikejazz,2019/03/01,"Wanted to share one of my coping methods in case any of you find it helpful Recently I've been thinking a lot about about my health anxiety and I think one of the main reasons why I am so afraid of contracting whatever disease it happens to be on any given week, is because I automatically catastrophize the situation. 

If I think I might have breast cancer I automatically think it will kill me. I imagine saying my last goodbyes to my family and friends and think of all the things I will never achieve in my life because I've died young. To reassure myself, I tell myself that I'm making it up it my head, I don't have cancer, it's so unlikely at my age etc. This reassurance is only fleeting before I find another 'symptom' and the cycle continues.

But lately I've been realising that one of the main problems is that I underestimate my ability to cope with health problems. There are hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors who end up living long and happy lives. People who are HIV positive can live relatively normal lives despite their illness thanks to modern medicine. Having an illness does not mean the end of the world. 

By reframing my thinking when reassuring myself from 'I don't have x disease, I'm OK' to 'I probably don't have x disease, but if I do I know I will find a way to cope with it and I will be ok', I have found that health anxiety worries have come up less frequently as the intrusive thoughts have less to hold on to.

healthanxiety,charunderwear,2019/03/01,"CWD is freaking me out My uncle likes to hunt deer here in Texas, and he sends us venison sausage from time to time after an especially successful hunting trip. I just ate some of this sausage not too long ago with my family. Now after reading a bit about what CWD is and how scientists are researching its compatibility with humans, I’m in full-blown panic mode. I was doing SO WELL these past couple of weeks but I can not stop worrying about the possibility of me becoming a zombie! He has the sausage made by what I’m presuming is a professional and state law requires meat to be inspected for CWD, so I’m sure if the sausage was indeed made by a professional it should be fine. I won’t know for sure until tomorrow, though.

healthanxiety,zdarmaram,2019/03/02,"Vaginal bleeding Ok, so I didn't have my period in 19 days and I usually get period 25-30 days after my last one. Now I started to bleed, very lightly, doesn't look like period. I don't sleep much (5 hours/night) for the last 14 days because I have so much energy (probably some hypomania) and stress, but I'm overall in a great mood so it could be hormonal imbalance. Now I'm scared that it's something serious. I know it could be ovulation (that got delayed) but I never had ovulation bleeding before. I'm sitting here crying because it's saturday and my gynecologist is there on monday. I'm supposed to write my thesis and now this health anxiety came up to my mind. Please someone calm me down that it happened to them and it was ok. I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my skin.

healthanxiety,ashbash1119,2019/03/02,"allergies that won't go away I think I'm allergic to my apartment bc I have allergy and asthma symptoms that start the moment I enter the apt and end after I spend some time out of it. Financially I can't really move until May. I take 3 different kinds of antihistamines daily, a combo inhaler, clean constantly bc of the dust, and run two air purifiers and a dehumidifier. I'm still not better. There's a vent in our bathroom maybe going to the ceiling of the upper unit bathroom and eventually out into the roof but that's it for ventilation. I think the people above have a cat and I'm allergic to cats but I'm not sure if the allergens can travel like that? Either way it's like I have legit ocd now about dust mold and cats. I'm constantly cleaning everything in an attempt to feel better and I keep getting worse. Drs give me more pills that do nothing. I think I am slowly losing it. Should I just start living in a hotel until I can figure it out? Move back home? I don't really have money so I'd have to probably move back in with my parents. All bc my partner had to live a pet friendly dusty old building (which I clean ALL the time and still sick). What are my options as tenant and what can I do to get better other than leave?

I am freaking out because I have swollen glands in my neck right now. And, now that I read the actual symptoms of BAE I feel like I am getting them. All of a sudden I got weak and dizzy while ago when standing up.

This is scaring me!!! So much. Help please. Can you even get it from tap water? Cold tap water?

healthanxiety,lecrepescule,2019/03/03,"Do you ever just feel one lymph node? Then you feel more and more? Seems like it’s common for someone to feel lymph nodes unilaterally, especially on the neck. In my case it has always been the right side of my neck.
I’ve felt one below my lower right jaw for several years. 

I started feeling again and finding more and they’re all on the right side still. A nice little stiff one around the posterior cervical area. Then today I found a pretty big soft one in the supraclavicular area (feels very long and narrow like an oversized Mike n Ike). Now I’ve freaked myself out. 

I was never worried about my lymph nodes until now since I’ve been able to feel more of them in a descending pattern on one side only. I suppose the good thing is that they’re not big enough that you could see the lumps in a picture or mirror. 

I seldom have an intense itch attack on my lower legs and abdomen. I’d say just a few occasions every couple months, brought on by some physical activity. Last stomach itch I remember happened after a bike ride at night in the summer.

Edit: Had a pretty intense scratching session on my calf after I said this.

Night sweats have happened but are rare as well. They always seem to happen when I cover myself up in a certain throw blanket, so I switched to a more silky blanket and reduced the problems. 

Thinking way too ahead now, I know most common lymphomas are treatable but it’s a matter if my insurance will cover the treatment and what I must do if they won’t. I *could* just hope it’s nothing though instead of stressing about potentially nonexistent financial burdens.

healthanxiety,Dhfsjrcnysdkh,2019/03/03,"I can't believe this So my health anxiety was somewhat under control, I went through a full course of CBT, my symptoms had persisted for so long that surely I would be dead by now (3 years) if my brain tumour was real, so it was clearly time to get my life back on track. Well...

I've tried, I caught up with old friends, made some new ones, actually have some hope for the future for the first time in a long time, even been trying to get a girlfriend (I'm 22 and have never had one). Turns out my health anxiety hates this, I'm not allowed to be happy because to be happy is to be excited for the future, something that's hard to do when your thoughts are once again racing with things you thought you had moved past. Why would I go out to the bar with friends if I'm dying, why am I mixing up words when typing, why is my leg suddenly jerking frequently, why am I even feeling motivated and confident, is this finally the personality changes that come with having a brain tumour. Anxiety is cruel but this is the cruelest thing it has done yet, preventing my ability to be happy because what's the point, I'll obviously be dead soon. 

And you know what set me off tonight? I sat down on the toilet and noticed a drop of liquid on the seat. Was it there before I sat down or did it leak out without me noticing? I must have urinary incontinence, cause brain tumours can cause that and wow it tends to be a late-stage symptom and I've had symptoms for over 3 years huh. 

3 fucking years.

healthanxiety,ForsakenVoice,2019/03/03,"Health anxiety by proxy, anyone? So I think it started last summer, when my husband got appendicitis. He denied the need to go to the ER for some time, until finally I made him call for medical help. They came, but they were unable to diagnose him, so they just gave him a pain shot and left. After this I finally made it home, and after a brief examination of his abdomen I was totally sure it was his appendix. So you could have guessed by now I have a health anxiety, and have had it all my life. And it's actually severe and affects my life hugely. Almost all of my family are medics, so I know a lot, but I myself is not a doctor at all. So, I called for medical help again, and I made them take him, and I insisted on the operation, though they weren't sure because my husband's symptoms were so smudged because of the drug they gave him. It was an appendicitis, the surgery was almost at the last moment before it would burst. But it was a minor surgery and after a few days he was totally fine, he just got 3 really small scars. And know my health anxiety went fully blown out on him, because it seems if I hadn't this anxiety and the knowledge it gave me, my husband could have been in a way worse situation. So I'm anxious over his every headache and all. I'm like a crazy mom, lol. When I think something bad can happen to him I cry, and I always fear the worst. It stresses me a lot sometimes.",4.638672948566942,5.047202904593644,5.885836277974089,80.86705045151159,69.42402826855124,9.257086768747547,29.50314095013741,9.2995712137729,2.36562834707499,1094,39,226,21,18,368,142,283,0.16699999999999998,0.7609999999999999,0.07200000000000001,-0.9827,0,0,2,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,6,0,14,9,0,2,19,1,22,15,2,4,8,50,45,27,0,5,7,4,0,1,0,1,13,0,1,0,13,14,0,0,7,0,0,4,3,5,1,0,22,0,41,4,23,20,11,32,0,0,0,0,31,10,0,8,18,160,54,1,0.0,0.0,0.09351426927157797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19191572675303284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0797365424594305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29323251990913113,0.10825832269384277,0.0,0.06700514036623742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08001234699584407,0.17524751177987058,0.0,0.08154253908955607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19570213039801787,0.10960166167096907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15302166292650585,0.0,0.1052625184465844,0.06180110897012121,0.0,0.0,0.09726336604505717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09808398147823952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11113001458687387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08073919248688731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09033807575461338,0.1078331009802962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20994970051197173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05446124015631059,0.0,0.15328475332644226,0.0,0.10556530581252002,0.0,0.08474035186880631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3055819330509492,0.0,0.0,0.12846292827179526,0.0,0.0961232609774083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10532908552021462,0.156225160890956,0.0,0.0,0.10411736300492258,0.0,0.13537224953462046,0.04681670263160224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16293901588235038,0.0,0.2720242089749077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2896097755998233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11223255296524376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105522089007214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10196770980547837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06138984739450864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08723817915281655,0.0,0.10825832269384277,0.0,0.0,0.10771464629105826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07377304822668157,0.0947763064649948,0.0,0.06782752596718647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10977060870853468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1806334435169812,0.09960194620987936,0.07205070280394726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12280537961684583,0.09415048784077408,0.0,0.05587805629161345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606377720143928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0888334824569951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09765688187483386,0.06807343601052011,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,pdg6421,2019/03/03,"Colon Cancer symptoms for 1.5 months Hello guys, I hope I’m in the correct sub, please direct me if I’m not. I’m 22 and have no family history of colon cancer.

Around mid January, I started having extremely large amounts of diarrhea, probably like 4-5 times a day. Within 2 weeks, I was still having diarrhea but now blood started showing up, and now every time (apart from 1-2 here and there) I have blood in my stool. Within the last week, I’m still going 4-5 times a day, but half of those are usually to pass mucus and blood, nothing else. The rest of the time I still pass mucus and blood, but with normal stool. It might be stress related because college/work is pretty hectic, but I manage and I have no other stress symptoms.

I went to my doctor around 2 weeks ago and he said there was nothing he can do, so he scheduled a GI appointment which is finally coming this Tuesday. The problem is that I read cancer stories from people my age, and they all say they initially got passed off by several doctors because of their age group, and they don’t get the diagnosis until they finally get a colonoscopy, so I will make sure I get one.

What do you guys think?

healthanxiety,amk3186,2019/03/03,"Breast cancer anxiety As the title suggests, my HA specialty is breast cancer. I do not have a family history of it; I’m 33 and live a very active, healthy life. But I live in almost constant fear of finding a lump and being given a death sentence. Like they are ticking time bombs. I check myself daily during the bad HA cycles (usually tied to menstrual cycle) and in several extra dark times, have convinced myself my ribs, muscle tissue, etc. are lumps. Always to be reassured by my OB that they aren’t and that I’m low risk and completely healthy. It makes me crazy though. Sometimes I even feel breast pain, which I’m pretty sure is psychosomatic because when I’m busy/preoccupied I don’t feel the pain. But when I obsess, I feel it constantly and live in a loop of crazy anxiety. I’m driving my husband nuts and the worrying often robs me of other joys. But I don’t know how to overcome this. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has this particular worry and if they’ve had any success getting past it.

healthanxiety,UnsweetenedTeaPlease,2019/03/03,"Shaking HA label when you know something else is wrong Hi fellow HA friends! I’m new to this sub and Reddit in general. 33F history of HA and panic disorder, but it has been fairly well controlled for the last decade. 

Since last fall, I’ve had chest/ abdominal pain. Doctor thought it was GERD, but I haven’t responded to multiple PPI’s. I recently had a full cardiology workup and it was clear. Normally cardiology tests would really excite me, but this time I honestly didn’t think it was my heart.

The pain is worsening and I’m so discouraged. It’s a constant burning and I can’t find any relief with a bland diet or medicine. Endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound were normal. I’m beginning to think they’ll never find out what’s wrong. It’s almost to the point I want pain medicine, and that’s not me.

I do realize the impact anxiety can have, especially on the digestive system, but I’m in constant pain. It feels like there’s more to this. I’m fearful of tests continuing to come back normal, they’ll blame my anxiety and depression and I’ll continue to suffer. Thanks for listening.

healthanxiety,slaskiekluski,2019/03/03,"Worried about my eyesight I suffer from visual snow (I see a layer of static on my vision, especially on dark surfaces, and have a hard time seeing in dimmer light) and while it's okay enough for me to ignore it most of the time, recently it's been taking all of my attention. I feel like it's gotten worse and fear that I have some sort of disease that makes my retina deteriorate, and it's just gonna keep getting worse until I'm blind. I scheduled an appointment to have it checked out, but it's in a few weeks time. Part of me suspects I'm just anxious about my future but it's really hard to distract myself since most activities involve using my eyes and I'm obsessovely checking if my field of view has gotten worse, or look for macular degeneration symptoms.

healthanxiety,hwouldgo,2019/03/03,"Afraid of hospital infection Well, I do not want to rationalize my fear of hospital infection; however, if we look at the stats, hospital infection rates are significantly higher than before. I will have an arthroscopic knee debridement surgery, the procedure just needs two 4-8 mm incisions basically. Usually, patient would be discharged after a few hours of waking up or stay one night at hospital in some cases. I know in every surgery there is a chance of infection and I know that my surgery is one of the easiest surgeries available too. However, I am really afraid to get an hospital infection. I had 4 surgeries before, but the nearest one was 7 years ago when I was 17 years old. I am almost 5 inches taller(6""4') and 100 pounds heavier now(300lbs currently). I mean when we put all those things together, these make me anxious. To sum up:
I am really scared of hospital infection even though my surgery is pretty easy and incisions will be just 8 mm max.
I am slightly afraid of anesthesia since my body changed a lot in last 7 years.
What are your thoughts? 
Thank you guys!
Have a great sunday!

healthanxiety,ArtKills_,2019/03/04,"I'm afraid to have any tests done so I don't go to the doctor Hi, things aren't going well  


I don't know if this is health anxiety related but I have a problem with having any tests done. Where it's not health anxiety is that I know I don't live a healthy lifestyle. My cholesterol was 230 in 2015. I haven't been tested since. I couldn't deal with a diagnosis. I barely make it day to day with my depression and yet I've already diagnosed myself with type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, Grave's disease, sometimes bowel OR colon cancer (sometimes I have bloody stool), a permanent heart defect that I'm convinced I have from taking too much immodium (poor man's methadone) back when I was addicted to opiates. I honestly think I'm dying and I'm only 30. But even though I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, I am sure I have most of those things because my body is slowly turning itself on me.  


But I think I'd rather die than be diagnosed with anything. I know that sounds insane but I've battled mental health and then later addiction for most of my life. I don't have enough to live for if I have some terrible disease. There would be no real support network. So I don't want a diagnosis if I know I'd rather die than have to deal with it. :-(",2.8807509881422924,4.797185276679843,4.286304347826088,84.81467391304352,75.6798418972332,7.603952569169961,26.12450592885376,8.438071523408619,1.8257051383399208,997,37,199,19,22,330,137,253,0.243,0.703,0.053,-0.9939,1,0,1,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,0,13,12,1,1,6,0,30,17,5,1,1,38,47,16,4,9,11,0,0,0,0,1,12,1,0,1,11,10,0,0,6,0,1,2,10,7,1,0,6,1,26,5,22,37,5,12,0,2,0,0,4,3,0,7,7,127,37,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22817862485053275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11548930863261204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14233787120910615,0.0,0.2401821862066337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08612208347670172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08047317491312603,0.0,0.06379666896670813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11624802537345355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13498753337033625,0.21578925801864304,0.09013913080711124,0.3186676280210277,0.3258458578888578,0.0,0.11994360727748705,0.1071187470866458,0.0,0.21419664085951312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10813651025916383,0.0,0.0691235888348943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11895560768244665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337298640144933,0.0,0.12401658624486753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23006243226801906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07392086629184409,0.0,0.0,0.184824426659824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06985797297046217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10546754608945756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07693340928384397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07959478397188556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10014062622127133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11912021290397246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08657163279969197,0.0,0.10473050234816754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070127873893977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11876116505900647,0.09863602527074293,0.0,0.07868747673934286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13905615952495315,0.13411729623735644,0.10282292932141704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11383450251766496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061728184402157424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09409734326274552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07434385376115292,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,freedom_costs_tax,2019/03/04,"Worried about Toxic Shock Because I’m an irresponsible idiot Thursday I started my period - no big deal there. Friday night my husband and I went out to grab drinks and dinner to celebrate his new job. I had put a tampon in and since it was a light one completely forgot and we had sex.  Neither or us felt the tampon probably due to alcohol. Saturday morning comes and I’m off running errands. I put a tampon in on top of the one already in there bc I never sleep with a tampon in so It was habit. I changed it normally throughout the day. When I got into bed at 11pm Saturday night I had a weird feeling I left my tampon in from Friday. I go to the bathroom and I had. I removed it, put a pad on and went to sleep. Now I’m worried sick I’ve got Toxic Shock Syndrome.

SO yesterday I’m tired which honestly probably was due to a busy weekend and the fact that I get up at 4 am M-F for work. Last night I was nauseous and dizzy falling asleep. However I had just remembered those were symptoms of TSS then started having them. This morning I felt some nausea and a headache. I get frequent headaches from sleeping like an idiot with my neck, but I’m worried because it’s together. Logically the nausea is the fact that I’m presenting to the entire leadership team today at work, but of course I go back to I just have TSS and this is the beginning. I’m so worried and now I’m afraid I’ll blow this presentation. I just started a new role so my health insurance doesn’t kick in until April. I would absolutely go to the doctor or ER if I was certain I had TSS and not just bad anxiety.

healthanxiety,Diovania,2019/03/04,"Routine eye checkup for first pair of glasses revealed cotton wool spot Or at least, that's what the optometrist said it most likely was. I've been suffering from astigmatism and double vision since I briefly took accutane, and then a week before my followup appointment, my right eye developed a large curved floater in my peripheral vision. It flashes blue in response to bright lights, sometimes it even flashes when I'm laying in bed with my eyes closed. 

I mentioned it at my appointment, got my right eye dilated, and boom... white spot in my nerve layer. Didn't have it on my checkup 12 days prior. He said it was nothing to really worry about, but classified it as most likely being a cotton wool spot, which is usually found in people with hypertension and/or diabetes. Told me it'd most likely work itself out, but to come back in a month. If it's not better by then, off to my doctor for bloodwork. 

Great. I've hardly been able to sleep at all...have therapy today, forgot what time it's at, and I'm obsessing over my eye. I'm not even excited for the glasses anymore. Hopefully this is a freak occurrence and not diabetes or something worse.

healthanxiety,btoned,2019/03/04,"Different Muscle Spasm Sensation While trying to go to sleep last night, I noticed a different type of muscle twitch/spasm in my thigh. I say it's different because any other time I felt a spasm I can see the muscle twitch. It's usually happened in my shoulder/upper arm in past. This one is in my thigh but it feels more like a cellphone vibration that's been coming and going intermittently. I'm a fairly active, muscular guy who's been focusing on running alot. In the past, when I neglect the gym for a few days I've noticed these things happen. I know it's hard to diagnose something like this and I'm most likely overreacting but I've become overly sensitive of new or noticeable indifferences over the years.

healthanxiety,Jerk0h,2019/03/05,"32 female upper back pain and chest pressure Of course delete if this doesnt belong here. As title suggests I've been experiencing upper back pain (between the shoulder blades) and chest pressure with palpitations for about 8 days now. Some fatigue but no other symptoms. Went to ER on Friday, they did urine and blood samples and a chest xray. All clear. Sent me home with a prescription for Tecta and said it was acid reflux. It very well could be of course, but I've struggled with acid reflux a lot in the past and it doesn't feel like this and has never exhibited itself in the form of upper back pain.  Taking pain meds doesn't really relieve the pain and it lasts all day and is worse near the evenings/night. I found taking a hot bath and a massage from my husband can relieve symptoms temporarily (20 mins tops) but it always creeps back.

healthanxiety,NCFly26,2019/03/05,"Hit my head on car trunk and caused my health anxiety to soar Im a 22 year old male and I hit my head Saturday afternoon on my car tailgate right before I went to go fish with some friends. It was the very top of my head but more towards my left side. Don’t really think it caused many problems other than hurting because I was still able to fish and remember when it happened and the events after it happened (didn’t blackout or whatever). Later Saturday night I felt my head and realized that it actually got cut and it’s looks kind of like a small raspberry-type injury about the size of a dime maybe smaller.

Anyways this caused me to become a huge hypochondriac and elevated my anxiety as I began to think about brain bleeds and what not. My pupils never became dilated and I’ve just had a minor headache which could possibly be due to stress/anxiety but the pressure is in my face (eyes and nose area). The place where I hit is still sore and has the common goose-egg. I’ve got a unrelated doctors appointment Friday and wanted to know if y’all thought I would be fine until then. I also wanted to ease my mind about brain bleeds and how common they were with an injury like mine? Haha hopefully this doesn't make me sound crazy, my anxiety has just been running rampant lately.

healthanxiety,Corx33,2019/03/05,"I tried this and it worked Now I don't think it would've worked right when the anxiety started today but by the end of the day I was so sick of the panic, nausea, warm rushes, and racing thoughts while trying to act normal in front of my kids. I just said screw it, I'm going to stop fighting it and reasoning with myself why I'm fine and shouldn't be anxious and let it wash over me.  It actually worked!  I'm so much calmer now I might actually sleep tonight which never happens on bad days.  I hope this can help others. I found this article which explains better than me.

healthanxiety,KyleTheMtn,2019/03/05,"Cannabis Carts are publicly known to have pesticides in them recently and I just found out I really hope I’m in the right place for this
I’m a 20 year old male 6’2” 140lbs and I have smoked no less than 3 and no more than 6 grams of the cartridge brands in question in the last 3 months. I have been having occasional random (brief) pains in various places on my chest and stomach. My left arm also has felt “tingly” but hasn’t actually gone to sleep. These symptoms have been going on for 2 weeks. I have thrown away the cart (as of yesterday) but I keep reading and seeing stuff about heated pesticides being like “nazi gas” and I have been dealthy afraid of whats going to happen to me. I can’t tell my family because they don’t know I smoke anymore (after getting in trouble 3 years ago and “stopping”. KARMA right) I don’t really know what my question is, I’m just unable to focus on my schoolwork or home life because I’m constantly thinking about my body and listening for a warning bell that this is gonna be the pain that sends me to the hospital. Can I detox without going to a doctor and be okay??",4.0504729729729725,5.215382009009012,4.8104391891891884,85.28701013513515,71.25225225225225,7.892342342342343,26.93806306306307,8.278499904357787,1.665125225225225,874,29,177,13,16,282,135,222,0.08800000000000001,0.875,0.037000000000000005,-0.8678,0,0,2,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,2,0,5,7,0,1,9,1,22,11,5,0,0,28,42,14,0,1,6,0,1,1,0,1,6,1,1,1,8,10,0,2,8,1,0,6,7,4,0,0,6,3,21,3,31,32,3,34,1,0,1,0,9,16,0,5,13,111,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.13273921935811112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12057653925170116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10877786594173082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13489866483334606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277984643903351,0.0,0.0,0.16583720744303246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15109133604421052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14699297504721842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13922571639998926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12823075822959848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13060379784574835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491426400993006,0.0,0.0,0.0710666137168517,0.0,0.2319157031306811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12028504572420105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13644256351126874,0.13510193064425935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12090385015806175,0.0,0.0,0.14950980953562762,0.11087722794762576,0.0,0.0,0.1477898249598897,0.0,0.0960773519696334,0.06645416371903866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10857258224272473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14273367946417007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28947698152900764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842310092921107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3047546827342132,0.0,0.13606021249757455,0.0,0.1742801496100092,0.0,0.13430670011455004,0.0,0.0,0.23232648525872185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083930408892166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13612163710764852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11372165532599585,0.0,0.0,0.15571425270086214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138039776637895,0.0,0.0,0.11889044937542802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715830402297245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1091097687870502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13112170613179666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1751892231864691
healthanxiety,repeatafterne,2019/03/05,"(TW: mention of suicidal behaviour) anyone with health anxiety who used to suicidal or still is even? A little long, TLDR at end.

I don’t have many people to talk about health anxiety with as I don’t know many people in my real life who deal with it. Or at least who are open about dealing with it.

A few years ago I got diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Anxiety after I went to the hospital with chest pain and difficulty breathing but it turned out to be a result of weeks of severe anxiety and stress building up and manifesting in some physical symptoms which at that point I didn’t even know could happen. I was paired up with a free psychologist from the hospital who dealt with SSA but unfortunately I really didn’t like him and at the time didn’t respect my diagnosis either. I felt discouraged that I had went to the hospital with real symptoms and worry (my dad has a sudden cardiac arrest in his sleep due to a genetic heart condition - they have not found it in me yet - but we still keep a close eye on my heart) so in a way I didn’t feel validated and thought they weren’t understanding me. It took me over a year to finally accept it and realize that I do get very anxious around the thought of loosing health and death.

A few months after all this I started university and was set up with the counsellor there. They turned out to be great and very helpful. Anyway, they really helped me dive into myself and get some better understanding of my anxiety. They also helped me realize something which is why I’m making this post. 

I had been suicidal for as long as I can remember. I’m currently 27 but when I was about 7-24 I remember constantly thinking about suicide. I always had a plan. I had attempted it a few times as a teen but wasn’t successful. Luckily I was able to get help and turn my life around and start to actually value life. I still had some times where I thought my life is so hard or this is it or my life is getting so disastrous that I should just end it. Now I find myself valuing life, enjoying being alive, and worrying about death/losing my health. I used to be so at peace with the thought of dying and saw it as an escape. And now it absolutely terrifies me to the point it affects my day to day life. 

I sometimes still have suicidal thoughts that cross my mind but I’m in a good place in my life and truly believe that I have put it past me for now. Sometimes I worry if something big or tragic happens in my life I’ll be back to feeling that way but currently I’m good. 

During the time I was suicidal I never did anything that has caused permanent damage (as far as I can tell so far), but I definitely wasn’t living a healthy lifestyle. I’ve struggled with addiction and substance abuse that I have recently gotten a hold on but know it could be too late for some damages the substances can do (mostly alcohol) but I am trying my best to live healthily and make sure my body has what it needs to recover. I think this fuels my health anxiety too. 

I will obsess over a symptom and convince myself this is it. Oh you’re finally enjoying life? Well too bad, it’s soon over. 
 
I know mental health and illness is complicated , everyone’s different, they often intertwine, and more. But I’m curious to know if anyone else has similar thoughts about this or any really.

*TLDR*: Was suicidal as a younger person, seems to be gone now, but since I am enjoying life and feeling guilt about how I used to life I feel it just fuels and fuels my health anxiety. Wondering if anyone has similar experiences to share?",5.1237872340425525,6.013001520567379,6.19418439716312,77.37000000000002,68.54609929078015,10.085106382978724,31.028368794326237,10.199797458751258,3.16017730496454,2852,113,545,72,47,952,299,705,0.17,0.6809999999999999,0.149,-0.9493,4,0,4,0,1,1,61.0,1,1,6,5,40,28,0,4,30,0,58,35,7,9,3,127,113,62,9,7,25,1,6,1,0,2,28,0,0,1,41,45,1,3,29,1,1,6,11,10,1,0,35,8,76,19,87,67,13,89,0,4,2,0,26,36,0,17,44,384,117,2,0.04578297951673225,0.05424534423911508,0.04467758373413761,0.04991020549482806,0.0,0.0,0.04058384895467015,0.04892808161022494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03661263217859586,0.038095106555942115,0.0,0.0,0.03113399603664178,0.0,0.24516697811742205,0.05172173524689549,0.0,0.09603757135618483,0.04691007289710047,0.03767549117960146,0.0815131166504333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035204285233696245,0.03822687554013945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05158173994492049,0.04804641241743917,0.04049132486818283,0.0,0.05085456920916759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047031731465812375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04947513615613865,0.0,0.07310796749832299,0.0,0.0,0.059052468513793935,0.09440048311573304,0.0,0.04646876048533543,0.04751550453809145,0.04783346918451934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03824580464261235,0.0,0.08110026148711638,0.0,0.0,0.06047845236247636,0.0,0.0,0.04374759891472185,0.0,0.044784539032358864,0.0,0.0,0.0925970002731031,0.0,0.04395884006600682,0.10030603241244204,0.04184481384968591,0.0,0.0,0.050198673938183634,0.0,0.0,0.09567886869879316,0.0,0.0,0.07680118211976875,0.036616831074304315,0.05047589654531342,0.0,0.0,0.08097147517206907,0.0,0.041012556953355414,0.0,0.0,0.34065616422352185,0.0,0.10850610232755907,0.12274946442510545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04069401579531255,0.0,0.0,0.12580564107021772,0.0,0.05164519506109613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38805446875473537,0.022367251204253945,0.045886573096043916,0.08085441939268533,0.08103299233192378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06112098867616207,0.09283351061437192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04613847508116215,0.0,0.04622775805152151,0.0,0.036543537455152784,0.0,0.0,0.03394749919762993,0.035310656234463174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04871631814586741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043705034400834696,0.06348030676435604,0.039975931782168204,0.04783346918451934,0.0,0.08655942802014722,0.0,0.04384743879258023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04602453975810932,0.0,0.0,0.04579536904119584,0.10422210771967587,0.0879892470558298,0.0,0.045205168972969834,0.0,0.1037263818679765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04167910506357626,0.0,0.05172173524689549,0.0,0.03787215376449698,0.0,0.04581604343700128,0.0,0.0,0.07049194877196995,0.09056107481960632,0.0,0.06481085709129088,0.0,0.14624938632939186,0.0,0.0524442483518757,0.04786231074147222,0.0,0.3505540409912745,0.0,0.043149916375213336,0.1903441828306067,0.034423102834480385,0.036798624707108187,0.040016342064131294,0.042150816401719256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0586717692772664,0.0,0.21807943036708455,0.13348211766587484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05086657481737284,0.03108363781815698,0.1493962044020509,0.0,0.09532339260082202,0.0,0.11862538387439245,0.0,0.07555150576560353,0.0,0.07268079623619449,0.036724344581569625,0.0,0.041164396900343916,0.08488256138410978,0.04131201792692371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04964968831474385,0.0,0.1394845141738592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0589654755096593
healthanxiety,karmapharm,2019/03/05,"I can't remember a day when I wasn't worried about dying... Hi all:

I'm a 26yo male that's been suffering from health anxiety for pretty much ever it seems. I've run the gauntlet of tests, doctor visits, and scans with my results always coming back negative, yet I'm never satisfied. I always have this sneaking suspicion I'm the 0.1% that is sick and doctors cannot diagnose.

For the past 2.5 years I've had a swollen lymph node ~1cm on the side of my neck, and lower on my neck I can feel multiple squishy, tinier lymph nodes. I've had ultrasounds many times, and even a biopsy for a swollen node in my groin that came back negative for anything strange. Today I found a swelling in my armpit and now I'm in crisis mode once again.

Every day with this feels like a battle; I must constantly convince myself that I'm healthy when deep down, part of me believes I'm not. Every time I think I've made progress it all comes rushing back in like the tide and I'm completely derailed again. I'm so fed up with this and it's clearly no way to live. I never think about the future at all because I can't picture lasting long enough to have a future.

I know this is kind of a rambling wall of text, I just needed to get this out somewhere because everyone I talk to in my personal life just tells me what to do to feel better. To change my thoughts, to eat healthier, to be more active, yet when these thoughts occur it's like I'm completely overwhelmed and I don't feel like I have a choice.

I guess that's it.",3.463379446640314,4.7073623961039015,4.267673630717109,88.31685206098253,72.76623376623377,7.434443817052514,27.352343308865052,7.893859768569023,1.5257468661773,1190,43,250,16,23,382,165,308,0.119,0.773,0.108,-0.6543,1,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,0,2,18,10,1,1,16,0,17,15,3,2,8,42,45,12,1,2,3,0,4,4,0,1,10,0,0,2,17,15,2,0,12,0,0,6,11,3,0,0,10,5,25,7,35,33,7,48,0,2,1,0,6,15,0,2,30,147,42,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18694264043917302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08593560092340387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09244173908025036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.259134937450428,0.0,0.13695616243201922,0.0,0.0,0.1265625369703304,0.0,0.09935075486168632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12848076551423498,0.0,0.0,0.11883502795907347,0.19353248574702872,0.2355612155677427,0.12139370939328015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14489294539980527,0.0,0.0,0.11401717396835982,0.1165854972357965,0.0,0.0,0.2299582840785745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11494625910154058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11607158887570004,0.0,0.0741958915229268,0.10161300531796998,0.1892933574101848,0.1073404485951798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22719883592372625,0.1605036081811032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123169003855764,0.0,0.0,0.05869015067105578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12374913934474993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11940634258986205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169791168903144,0.06173611481903295,0.09156762752426012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07934519415319688,0.21952389046867166,0.0,0.09919343991234483,0.09941251592886156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10629363969688116,0.0,0.11388957247044178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08257879814873686,0.08329462377263984,0.17327861525776075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11963259842828307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12164733908533247,0.10723601100024373,0.0,0.09808617060042192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428459262221576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12725311373736586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10226512872834204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09029023264674353,0.09818532250592953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143958850093035,0.0,0.17836212322277245,0.13100632487391614,0.0,0.106479990768451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08916591385341835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11408115869923632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07233974835022282

Could intense squeezing like this for a minute cause any permanent damage? I didn't have any noticeable bruising or pain after and the doctor didn't see anything wrong but I am still worried.

healthanxiety,HighTurning,2019/03/06,"How many of you have been triggered by lymph nodes? So I have lived most of my life with anxiety, always taking new faces. On december my uncle died of ALS, and shit was rough, part because he was an amazing uncle and part because that illness is awful.  Ever since then I have been suffering health anxiety and just now I am realizing that's what I am feeling. 




In this time I have been convinced that:



* I have ALS, because fuck yeah I do have all the symptoms. 



* I have a tumor on my head, my long time sinuses problems are caused by it, also as any other new gen kid my sight has develop some wear and my right eye has astigmatism and myopia, which is normal. 



* Last but not least, I have been touching my lymph nodes for fucking 2 months, and they ""don't go away"", which my ENT already said was a normal stuff for me. 




Just now I realized maybe lymph nodes are never that small that if you push hard on your skin they won't be felt, it's said a lymph node with a 1 cm diameter is normal. So I have been probably just pushing real hard on my neck that I always find them ""swollen"".",4.01388632872504,4.887609774193553,4.78840552995392,86.49879877112139,71.07373271889402,7.814316436251921,26.448233486943174,8.021203637495839,1.426545560675883,839,26,176,11,15,271,129,217,0.107,0.8590000000000001,0.034,-0.8807,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,3,3,0,12,7,3,0,6,2,30,19,7,3,3,32,38,14,1,5,6,0,7,0,0,1,10,2,0,1,14,8,0,0,5,0,0,3,4,5,0,0,11,11,28,2,16,25,6,23,0,1,2,2,10,8,3,3,12,121,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13948701731501506,0.10108310263794043,0.2103520745087962,0.0,0.0,0.0859572428868125,0.0,0.1933933519493622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11875821593943905,0.0,0.0,0.2311592434181386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298489908020891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13118463044908624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11433724491905375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06391231335754269,0.0,0.12136510482397632,0.0,0.1155285310436134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23371199643933865,0.0,0.0,0.07183679210213094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2264615383967946,0.0,0.12972423740205086,0.13435870925048873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10303395930605844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08928100166563585,0.0,0.0,0.1116146953643492,0.11186120463821607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12815111511101376,0.1269871313885641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008923403625742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09748850262800632,0.2441583957043983,0.0,0.0,0.3715394148612045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737606580816501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362820188927858,0.12094900756656304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14387239300879065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079460501987564,0.2404732320784369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12974915484770225,0.10456049123762637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14469928833116613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13137938618934755,0.09503807374353072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474112708917694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Hawke50,2019/03/06,"Hard lump in penis and doctor diagnosed as a cyst with no ultrasound or biopsy I discovered a hard lump in the middle of my penis. It seems pretty deep/internal (like close to the urethra) and not close to the skin. I have no pain and no symptoms, except a minor case of vitiligo (loss of skin pigmentation) on my penis that started developing within the last year. No STDs. I saw my doctor and I feel like he brushed it off too easily. He said it's most likely a cyst, showed me a picture of an epidermoid cyst during his explanation, and said he just wants to monitor it (follow-up in 6 months) and take no further action (no ultrasound, biopsy, etc). My medical record was updated to say it's a cyst.

It's the VA and I don't know what their deal is but I guess they try hard to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures. I just don't view it as unnecessary and expected him to order an ultrasound. I pushed back a little said it felt like gambling; the doc responded by saying the odds are against anything serious like penile cancer, I'm too young (31) and further action is unnecessary. On top of that, it's a resident who saw me, who had to confer with an attending for guidance/final approval, and the attending never saw me. The resident seemed inclined to order an ultrasound until he spoke to the attending who put the kibosh on that.

I acknowledge the odds of cancer are low, I just wonder what would happen if they encountered someone who had a genuine case of early-stage penile or urethral cancer. They'd be less likely to catch it at an early stage because they'd wait until it's symptomatic by bleeding, or blocking the urethra, etc. The potential negative consequences for them are nil, and the patient is the one who would be subjected to a penectomy or worse if it turned out they were too complacent. What a nightmare that would be.

Does my irritation seem justified or am I making too big a deal of it?",6.469601189001738,6.842173558583107,7.4101870200644075,71.64736871439189,65.45776566757493,11.032400297250431,33.30307158781274,10.832165505486646,3.7821564032697546,1524,61,269,40,22,513,184,367,0.152,0.79,0.058,-0.9871,1,1,0,0,0,0,45.0,0,0,7,3,9,11,0,1,33,0,22,18,2,1,1,49,45,23,0,7,13,0,7,6,0,3,16,6,0,0,25,16,0,3,8,1,1,8,11,5,0,1,12,18,28,6,41,25,4,41,0,2,4,0,27,19,0,13,17,188,53,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09514178285940192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890125534018872,0.0,0.07047819305980575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383892017121863,0.0,0.1173473943250156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23667491923243836,0.10117598551893656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2578838980529881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0584587182381941,0.08259580352799488,0.11100910128480612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273636115213615,0.0,0.10223848803857773,0.0,0.3107065892967825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06353930690979845,0.09424214020141687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3389036358558236,0.11587719859720395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07717430683329565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11647054768098485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228326417559783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891698736472271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834411871902408,0.0,0.12302314363065693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11762262375872005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11622560531449105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32993071708870064,0.1838843218011112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157562839589436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979607176963603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08183331257602669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12016887069295172,0.08692853822694714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07849539918875899,0.12575656653004258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06819307289847401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12538017997323195,0.0,0.0,0.11782216770709808,0.24639000263114494,0.0,0.0,0.07445265199593254
healthanxiety,ski--free,2019/03/06,"Read this if you’re under 35 and worried about pancreatic cancer. Figured this might be useful info with the news of Alex Trebek (78 years old).

Stats Canada: “From 2011 to 2013, new cases identified prior to the age of 35 were diagnosed at a rate of 0.2 per 100,000 persons.”

That’s a 0.0002% chance... considerably less than getting killed by lightning (0.0006%).

I actually managed to convince myself I had this condition, I spent too much time researching symptoms and not looking at the actual statistics. Figured this might help some.

healthanxiety,throwawaymaybe222,2019/03/06,"Possible Health Anxiety? Maybe Serious I don't even know whatever it is making me procrastinate. Basically like a year ago I fell off a horse (with a hat) on and landed on my head from about 4foot. I had a slight headache when I got off which was probably a concussion so I thought nothing of it.

Anyway like a month or two ago I reminded myself of it and now I have just been having thoughts like ""Has this made me less intelligent"", ""Have I become dumber"". Anyway I was wondering if anyone else had ever experienced this.

healthanxiety,ZeeFeeFiDO,2019/03/06,"Worried sick - lump on lower leg/ankle. Any idea what it could be? 23 year old female here. For the past month I’ve had a lump on my lower leg by my shin. At first it was red and felt just like a bruise when I touched it. Although I was a bit concerned at first because I do not usually bruise with a lump, I passed it off as one. Now one month later the lump is still there. What concerns me even more is how the pain has disappeared yet the lump and redness remains.

healthanxiety,Maraea86,2019/03/06,"Health Anxiety flare-up Hey guys. I'm having a miserable time lately. Just some background: I'm a generally healthy 32 year old female. My HA is out of control the last few months. It started in December when I got a (possible?) eczema patch/dry skin on my cheek after a bad cold. I was convinced it was precancerous or the beginning of rosacea. It eventually went away with moisturizing. Didn't stop me from googling the crap out of it, and worrying, and asking my husband to look at it and reassure me. He of course was thrilled with this 😜

Around that time in December, I started to eat a big salad everyday/just upped my veggie intake in general to help lose more weight. This made me gassy, and gave me loose stools. At the beginning of January, I started having some soft, thin stools. This has continued off and on. I have mostly normal stools, but if I go more than once a day, my second is sometimes narrow. This has really scared me, and caused a ton of googling, and symptom checking. 

Yesterday, I noticed a few small streaks of bright red blood on my normal stool toward the end of it. It happened again today with my first bowel movement. I spent pretty much all day yesterday googling, and trying to get a look at what I think is a hemorrhoid. I'm just freaking out. Of course, I'm scared I have cancer. I have an appt with a PCP tomorrow morning re: the blood, which I'm really nervous about. I'm the kind of HA sufferer that hates going to the doctor. 

I also just found out I'm pregnant again (with my third) yesterday, I'm about 4 weeks. I haven't told my husband yet. I'm of course worrying about whatever horrible GI disease I may have, and the impact on this pregnancy.

I started therapy for HA about a month ago. My therapist had told me I need to stop googling and reassurance seeking, but it's so hard, especially with the onset of a scary symptom. Feeling like a failure for googling and symptom checking so much lately. Anyway, I just wanted to share with some people who probably get what I'm going through.

healthanxiety,obiwancomeblowme,2019/03/06,"Nightly chest tightness For the last week and a half I have had uncomfortable chest tightness occurring only at night. I feel fine during the day (aside from the normal anxiety I have), but around 6-8pm every night I will begin to feel this pressure in my chest almost like someone is sitting on me or I have a tight band strapped around me. I feel the pressure mainly in the center to right side of my chest. Laying on my back/side seems to give a little relief. My breathing is ok but it feels like I should be having trouble breathing l (if that makes sense?). 

I am able to go to the gym and lift weights with no issues, it’s not until late in the day the tightness shows up. 

Has anyone else had a similar issue? I’m hoping it’s only anxiety since it presents with no other symptoms and goes away by the next morning.

healthanxiety,Rosieposey95,2019/03/06,"Waiting for fine needle aspiration results I had a fine needle aspiration on a lymph node on my neck 2 weeks ago, I just got a letter through the post about a consultation in a month (so waiting 6 weeks in total for results).

I rang the hospital and gave my information and they asked the Ent secretary, who said they won't give me my results over the phone. I also have severe anxiety so waiting 6 weeks, well after 2 I'm already going kind of insane about it, I'd rather know if there is something wrong or not and be able to prepare myself instead of being in a state of limbo... 

Anyone else had to wait until their appointment to find out results? Were they good or bad? Just so I know if there is a chance I'll be fine. I guess this is also venting my frustration of waiting along with asking for advice...

healthanxiety,Sugoi_Spooder,2019/03/06,"Help, IDK if this is the right reddit, but I don't know if I will get rabies because of this... ... and if you know another reddit for this shit, feel free to share.

You see I just pet a beagle an hour ago at the time  this shows up. I just like peting then every now and then , and the owners don't mind so I pay them sometimes.  Just this time the beagle got a bit jelous and then all a sudden I just felt something warm and ,BANG, I saw a small red spot on where that little bastard bit me and now I'm scared. I looks like it did not penetrate the skin(?) but it stings a bit. I immediately sprinted to my home and wash it with antibacterial soap just in case cuz I'm not sure if this is real!!!!

The anxiety is killing me, my sibling , who got scratch by a cat and got a tetanus shot for it, just told me 'GG' after I told him about the incident. And I don't want to tell my mom cuz she'll go ham on me and go the Beagle's Owner's House of any case something happened to me. And were broke right now so we can't even afford such a shot. 

Tl;dr- Got bitten by a dog and now the anxiety is now slowly killing me😨😨😨

Now for the question: Am I gonna fucking due?!?!?!?

Btw, I'll give you the pic in the next update, tnx😢😢😢😢",0.9908784473953034,2.175606925093636,3.0203353762342537,95.02445607763028,79.0,5.903234593122232,20.00153217568948,6.351523495107088,-0.1474853932584268,927,21,231,7,22,314,143,267,0.161,0.774,0.066,-0.9815,1,0,2,0,0,0,42.0,1,3,1,0,18,13,5,1,22,0,13,4,2,2,2,40,36,25,2,5,14,1,5,2,0,3,1,0,2,0,12,14,0,0,5,1,2,2,6,7,0,0,10,9,27,7,20,23,4,31,0,1,4,1,18,11,3,5,20,136,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10826753572495043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08305769696517874,0.12807183151729545,0.18686972594550996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07445389415217941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4000275918567025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067067528584712,0.0,0.10290612226612443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06175639628395688,0.0,0.11727116598994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11291416246881295,0.06381180938838348,0.11716543155074498,0.13882712634759786,0.0,0.3907381057819077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10800579918732818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08186620026914875,0.0,0.12251388380390665,0.0,0.12028084736135285,0.14093029125345616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702541234293696,0.0,0.13424716570558498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11934043868191738,0.12241387448293745,0.0,0.0,0.10256474961780504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12332407041820335,0.1430459788108034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129894630462971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13682196679818395,0.0,0.0,0.1390192288497954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20860953713469566,0.0,0.0,0.12228095735563405,0.0,0.09732778448974848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253724017069637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18805484887633825,0.12079712318899408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511316035844943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10675356959980054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14243873181347544,0.0,0.0,0.2334152551016435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07203986951235312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,bug-one,2019/03/06,Terrified to go for an MRI For the past two months I’ve had a slight ringing in my ears. My doctor called for MRI which is this Saturday. I am so scared to go incase they find a tumour that is causing it. I’m going away in April for 2 weeks and am wondering if it’s a cop out if I wait until after my vacation to get the test done ? I’ve felt this way about many tests and they have always ended positively with a sense of relief but something about them looking at my brain is absolutely terrifying to me!

healthanxiety,batheinsriracha,2019/03/06,"I have an appointment with yet another specialist next week, and I feel like it's not even worth it because my symptoms are probably all in my head. I have had so many little health issues over the years that I worked up with my anxiety. Googling things constantly, always asking the doctor about every little thing. Every single damn time, I end up at a specialist and get a bunch of expensive tests just to find out nothing's wrong. It's all in my head. 

I have an appointment with an allergist next week to find out what caused a bad reaction... But now, all I can think is that the reaction was not real. It was probably just a panic attack. I'm sure all the tests will come back normal again, and I'll be left with regret and a big bill as I'm reminded that I'm still just a hypochondriac.",6.038727144866384,5.8471773734177255,6.5667932489451495,79.25028832630099,66.40506329113924,10.819690576652603,29.58087201125176,10.504223727775694,2.8492762306610406,627,19,126,15,9,205,96,158,0.141,0.828,0.031,-0.9439,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,1,11,8,2,1,13,0,11,5,2,1,5,30,19,7,0,2,6,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,10,11,0,0,4,0,3,1,2,6,0,0,3,1,11,2,17,14,6,26,0,1,0,0,1,12,1,0,14,85,21,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11207612335107536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1412383089732992,0.1030404725932393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12592062365127846,0.1532337678427194,0.0,0.10357130274840376,0.11246378880897503,0.08210815744530628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13836774887179948,0.0,0.11602687698252442,0.0,0.14555626598665414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13786492451077711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929882512451913,0.0,0.0,0.0889640573272234,0.0,0.2269708572084285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06810528807228855,0.09622535632608167,0.0,0.0,0.24621558738696656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0703720087685688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27646962202102665,0.14317332792094098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14058544762275246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463453274897836,0.0,0.0,0.06580464084832532,0.2699973666653612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13655848384950664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28649700303261577,0.0,0.13197143372449266,0.12924243950619596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1580342821398072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2904456330298323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15331115800327735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10756673063902547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269474162818075,0.13999854602556014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17896929769127445,0.08630641892402133,0.0,0.0,0.07854110218967136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21608666022588605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09805877078776773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14726664614753612,0.0,0.0867384620249155

healthanxiety,eadruc01,2019/03/06,"I hate this stupid disease. My HA first manifested itself when I was a freshman in college. I felt a coldness in my chest  on the way home for a weekend (probably a flare up of the anxiety I didn’t know I had,  triggered after moving away from home for the first time, dealing with college life and new workload, homesickness, my parents moved from my respective childhood homes, first childhood pet died, etc). 

I googled my symptoms and that’s where it all went downhill. Heart attack. All of the sudden I was sweating, shaking, chills, feeling of doom, lightheaded, I truly felt I was going to die. To the point I told my mom not to be sad when I inevitably died.


Later that night I had a two hour long panic attack. I begged my boyfriend to drive an hour to where I was to take me to the hospital to which he obliged. I missed my sister’s college graduation party sitting in the hospital getting laughed at and joked on by the doctors and nursing staff. “Did your boyfriend break up with you recently?”, “Are you on your period honey?”.

Subsequently that semester I went to the emergency room two other times. One doctor gave me an emergency script for Paxil. Never filled it. Never wanted to. 

Went to a cardiologist, my pediatrician, gastroenterologist, got an endoscopy, etc. I even slept at the foot of my dad’s bed for a week because I thought He could save me if I died. turns out I’m a perfectly healthy 21 year old, which is great until I started searching “healthy 21 year old surprise heart attack” and other similar things. 

The anxiety subsided after about 8 months. A few months later it resurfaced when I convinced myself I had bed bugs in my apartment. Called the bug people 5 times, hired private bug people (instead of my apartment ones), stayed with my mom for a few weeks, begged my best friend to move. No bed bugs. 

Eventually I healed from that two and recently (random itching and a few colds) has convinced me I had lymphoma. A headache recently convinced me I had brain cancer or MS. A bruise on the back of my leg has convinced me I have a deep vein thrombosis for the last three weeks. 


My anxiety has caused me to have a slew of unimaginable PHYSICAL symptoms:
Arm and leg pain
Itchy skin
Chest pain
Tingling 
Numbness 
Panic
Sweating
Shivering
Rashes
Stomach pain 
Twitching muscles
Headaches
Heavy head
Pins and needles
Back pain
Joint pain
Susceptibility to more colds and flus
Mood swings
fatigue 
Lack of appetite
Increased appetite
Missed periods

I hate this terribly debilitating disease. A disease most people will never understand. Convinced my family and friends don’t believe me and don’t trust me and don’t take me seriously, convinced the doctors must be missing something, convinced I’ll be that rare case that dies at 21 from a heart attack. 

The worst part? I’ve been doing well, healing. Taking care of myself. It always comes out of no where. Three months of stress, no symptoms. A month later it all catches up to me.

When will I stop being a slave to health anxiety? Checking, poking, prodding, literally self inflicting bruises all over me from constantly pressing on my body parts to check them for changes, pain, sensations.

Please give me your success stories and small  victories😭

healthanxiety,heklermp5,2019/03/07,"Hardcore Health Anxiety (lymph nodes, etc) My first health anxiety type was brain tumor. Then it was lung cancer, throat cancer, breast cancer (I am male, 21), testicle cancer, then again lung cancer, again breast cancer. After that it was lung cancer again then once I found out what lymph nodes are, I started to search for them and found multiple. Wow. Couldn't get worse.

Couple months ago I would press hard on my ribs to feel if something hard that I felt is actually a rib or lymph node. I would spend hours rubbing ribs. It caused so much pain.

It's been 3 years since I started to worry about lymph nodes and what gives me a huge relief is a thought ""if it was something cancerous, I would for sure have more symptoms, which I dont"".

I am 21, male, gained 16 kilograms in the past 2 years, went to gym, etc. and I don't think I could do that if I had a terminal illness",3.833698568872983,5.2430558313953535,3.8397674418604666,91.09879248658319,72.0813953488372,6.920214669051878,23.114490161001786,7.321109707123232,0.6689288014311261,681,17,144,7,13,208,101,172,0.251,0.6629999999999999,0.086,-0.9863,0,0,2,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,1,2,5,4,0,0,5,0,20,27,10,1,1,21,31,11,0,8,4,0,6,0,0,3,17,0,0,2,11,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,3,1,0,1,11,6,17,3,11,15,4,21,0,0,0,2,4,4,0,4,16,83,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.13436588552220538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122054156624568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21066542843356853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537079286315471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414458822046329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993451268644787,0.15235171480471782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613720238949059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30712219637245297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06962036047222883,0.0,0.1322042952713414,0.0,0.0,0.11711931172968355,0.0,0.30194064727769643,0.0,0.0,0.07193750670905835,0.1320850967718493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24668695448526815,0.0,0.0,0.29271673263563625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355972248234621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990309591258524,0.0,0.10121822448788527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14663569191177686,0.0,0.0,0.1465122032114145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314409857970793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11389885154669915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21200146308929546,0.0,0.0,0.1949158275063663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12977149253339235,0.14311295812363334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822639425854567,0.0,0.10931073007372526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276403016067115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13983119868442878,0.14031819435322893,0.293433748068843,0.0,0.0,0.17733609720794852
healthanxiety,pommeG03,2019/03/07,"Been Working Through “Red Herrings” With my Therapist and It’s Been Helpful for Managing my HA Hi all, I wanted to share my recent success with managing my HA. I’ve had lifelong depression and have been in therapy for years now. Tried several medications and none have worked for me. 

Though my main problem is depression, every once in a while, I switch to anxiety for a few months, and that’s when the HA kicks in. I’m in one of those cycles now.

During my last appointment, my therapist brought up the concept of “Red Herrings.” They’re basically problems that people manifest as a sort of poorly managed coping mechanism for another problem that’s harder to process. 

The most common example of this is an eating disorder. Very often, the main problem at the core of a person with an eating disorder isn’t their body, it’s the sexual abuse they suffered, or their toxic mother, or the constant pressure they feel put upon them, etc. 

In a way, the red herring can give you something to focus on that’s easier to process than the more abstract pain that is often the causes of our mental illness. 

For me, we’re exploring the possibility that my HA is a red herring.

My current homework is to practice mindfulness and pinpoint what I have been thinking about when the hypochondria rears its head, and also to let myself experience whatever pain I’m feeling. 

We often try to avoid or push aside negative feelings like sadness and fear by distracting ourselves with a glass of wine, or binging a tv show, and sometimes you just need that, but she’s challenged me to try and just let myself experience those negative emotions. Because pain and fear and sadness are parts of life, and while they’re uncomfortable, they’re also okay. It’s OKAY to feel bad sometimes, and letting those feelings have their moment can actually help you. 

So, anyway, sorry for the rant. I’ve been practicing this for a little while now, and it’s been actually helping me. Anxiety still comes and goes, but it’s much better than it has been.

I’m not a psychologist, and I’m not claiming this is a cure for everyone (or even myself), I just wanted to share my recent experience. Maybe someone could get some comfort from it!",6.710712669683262,7.648972416666666,7.015294117647059,72.71613122171948,65.02941176470588,9.904374057315234,35.79034690799397,9.943994293440598,3.753925414781297,1758,82,294,37,26,570,207,408,0.16899999999999998,0.738,0.093,-0.9827,1,1,2,0,1,0,47.0,2,3,6,5,20,31,0,5,26,6,27,11,2,1,1,59,44,33,0,8,12,1,5,1,0,0,6,0,1,1,22,22,3,1,7,3,1,5,6,18,0,1,9,9,33,13,48,31,11,34,0,5,4,0,21,10,0,11,19,216,55,8,0.0,0.10005435291447104,0.16481365518104266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350624011150974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08854868566987012,0.12920146786320566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050863718830863,0.05147731856468996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07468536452598154,0.0,0.0938001424147742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674900167498299,0.0,0.07274249836228587,0.0,0.09125580827060774,0.0,0.06742302481014004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14546592563079871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19356419015680332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17281807820882755,0.0,0.09499005313880714,0.0,0.0,0.09417928437462048,0.055775592369021236,0.0,0.07114914939603811,0.08069149089882731,0.0,0.24781231290764694,0.0,0.19004979304768724,0.21349143124862505,0.060328029220459316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04411939600312948,0.08100801594580563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08666565691548947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16980653002468846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883452118657199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2590543671883315,0.05964649948524513,0.04125590642124312,0.08463678206832495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08483706192463224,0.0,0.0,0.08507016462936676,0.08510140977918944,0.0,0.08526609026837963,0.0,0.06740375684895268,0.0,0.06207731033792348,0.06261542097163393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993192085199052,0.05722259583963583,0.0,0.2695685550620325,0.0,0.0,0.0914464703952379,0.0,0.058544019815988675,0.0737347332332668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09519984528455223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3232125438994325,0.0,0.08489125856378002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16675989408574554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09539961123539434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07155057263460295,0.0650104301022549,0.167037924957641,0.09453005416546373,0.0,0.0,0.06743844987333653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965710242968538,0.1960959465747139,0.0,0.054109398619605814,0.08296747736461485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1719992735826841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06967655129784005,0.09961653059183996,0.06702907077762875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12295495938430392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05438026598565553

healthanxiety,onceuponatragedy,2019/03/07,"(With picture) Long standing white sore on tonsil causing ear pain and discomfort (should I be worried?) Here is photo: [https://imgur.com/a/ILiQNNC](https://imgur.com/a/ILiQNNC) (warning. picture of tonsils. could be disturbing for some)

White sore located at the top region of my tonsil. Had to use q-tip to see it hidden behind the flap of skin (opening of throat.)

I have ear discomfort and throat discomfort when I swallow.

MORE INFO: I'm 25. I had throat discomfort on one side of throat for 5 months (brushed it off because I couldn't afford a doctor visit.) It felt worse recently, so I looked into my throat and searched around to discover a sore a few days ago. I don't think it's a tonsil stone. Not sure about a canker sore either. I'm worried sick that it could be tonsil cancer. I DO have a doctor visit tomorrow, thankfully. But I'm still worrying myself sickly.

healthanxiety,lighton1997,2019/03/07,"My story with HA &amp; what has helped me! Hello, hello! Long-time lurker, first time poster. I first came to this sub like most of you, looking for other people who have experienced similar symptoms/reassurance. When I kept searching around, though, and reading people's posts about how they overcame their HA, that actually ended up helping me more than anything else. I've made a lot of progress in the past few months (much of it thanks to advice I've read in this sub!), so I thought I'd share some things that help me and a little bit about my story. 

I first started noticed my anxiety around health in my early 20s. I would take dozens upon dozens of pregnancy tests, convinced that they were all wrong and that I was pregnant anyway (even though I was on birth control at the time). I'd have headaches and get an MRI. etc. etc. You all know how it goes. I would Google myself into a hole until my anxiety was so bad that I started manifesting other physical symptoms. Then I convinced myself that those physical symptoms were also related to whatever I thought was wrong with me in the first place. It was a vicious, endless, painful cycle and I could not get myself out of it. It would go away but sure enough, when my life was stressful, it would happen all over again. 

A few months ago I had a panic attack in a cab on a way to a work meeting because I thought I was having a stroke and it was so bad that I had to get out of the car. I decided right then and there that I had to fix this thing. So, I tried changing some things. 

* I do. not. Google. symptoms. ever. I'm talking EVER. I put a note on my computer to remind me and everything. I do not do it. If I am feeling the urge to do it, I distract myself with a podcast or another task (I am online all day for my job, so if I can do this, anyone can).
* I remind myself that when you Google a symptom, you are asking Google's algorithm to show you the worst case scenario. And that is the result you are always going to get.
* I actually go to my annual doctor's appointments. I used to be so anxious about medical issues that I would avoid check-ups altogether. Now when I am having a minor symptom, I remind myself that I just went to the doctor and my tests/bloodwork were all fine. This helps.
* If a symptom persists for more than a few days, I make an appointment and I go. 99.9% of the time whatever symptom I was wanting to Google disappears within a day. 
* I read this somewhere on here and it really helps. Whenever I'm *not* feeling anxious (or sometimes when I am, if I can focus), I try to sit completely still and really appreciate all the sensations my body is feeling that I usually ignore. It helps to put my other ""symptoms"" in perspective. There are millions of things going on in your body at all times. Obviously sometimes you're going to notice something every now and then. That doesn't mean you're dying. 
* This one is what I struggle with the most but I REALLY try to not scroll through my phone before bed. Putting it on airplane mode and reading a book instead has done literal wonders for my mental health.   


I hope this helps someone! I still struggle with this often, but these tips have really helped me, so I hope they help you too.

healthanxiety,ADingoAteMyDildo,2019/03/07,"19f low heart rate So I have a lot of anxiety about my heart rate. it has always been about it being too high, I'm always freaking out over high heart rate. never once did it occur to me that it could be too low, because that was never a problem for me. a few weeks ago I was sitting down listening to music with friends. I looked at my fitbit (which I constantly check for accuracy and it is usually a max of 3 beats off) and my heart rate was 54. I got up and I felt super heavy and drained and had zero energy, but I forced myself to walk around and stand up for a while to increase my heart rate. I am diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Disorder. usually when I stand up my heart rate shoots up a fair bit. But I was walking around and standing up and it only went to 56. so I forced myself to skip around. I barely could, I felt super heavy and all I wanted to do was submit to gravity and collapse. that made my heart rate go to 57. it took about half an hour to get to an okay place at 72 bpm sitting down.

then last night, I laid down in bed and my bpm immediately sunk down to 52. I was up for three hours laying in bed bc I couldn't fall asleep over anxiety over my heart rate. I checked it on my fitbit and manually constantly and it was often hovering between 47 and 50. laying in bed typing this now after having stood up for a while it's 59.

i am a 19 year old girl, 120 lbs. during the summer I'm moderately active but during the winter I am pretty darn sedentary. I booked an appt with my cardiologist, but that's for a few days yet. every time I started to fall asleep last night my mind jerked me back, convinced I was either passing out or dying. it's gonna be a anxious and sleepless few days.

healthanxiety,Silevvar,2019/03/07,"Just gotta say, today was really tough I recently got hired at a fast food restaurant and today was my third day of training. While my trainer was going over some things, I got this pain beneath my shoulder blade that felt really sharp when I breathed in. I started internally panicking, worried something was wrong and I was gonna mess up at my new job, because I didn’t want to leave early or make anyone worry, and I didn’t want to die in the bathroom, etc. I felt a panic attack starting, my chest felt heavy, and I felt so scared, I was convinced something was wrong with my lungs since it was hard to breathe as well. I managed to keep myself from having a panic attack and pushed through my shift, even though I got a bad headache for the last hour of it. I got home exhausted. I’m still scared that something is wrong with my lungs. Health anxiety is so incredibly exhausting. I hate waking up every day worrying about dying.

healthanxiety,marjoriemargarine,2019/03/08,"Lumps and bumps I just need somewhere to let this out. I have a skin disorder called hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). It’s pretty mild for HS, and the last few years it’s gotten much better. 

I have also noticed a couple of cysts. On the back of my head, my ankle, and on the batwing area of my arm. 

Doctors have looked at the cysts and told me they’re nothing to worry about, but I can’t stop worrying that it’s something else or that having these cysts means I’m developing others in dangerous spots- my brain or lungs. 

I stupidly looked up diseases that are cooccurring with hs- thinking it would make me feel better if I saw that people with HS are just more likely to develop some benign cysts- and it mentioned thyroid disorder (which I have) and lymphoma and heart disease (which I am constantly terrified about).

Talk me down.

healthanxiety,GrimnirTheYoung,2019/03/08,"Worried about possible Petechiae So for the past few weeks I’ve been having these tiny, pinprick-sized red or sometimes brown dots appear on my skin. Of course the anxious side of my brain has decided that I’m dying of leukemia or some other cancer, even though I have no other symptoms that point towards it. 

What’s especially odd is that these spots appear in certain areas and then go away after a few days. The first time they appeared was on my right hand and arm after I spent the night with my girlfriend. After about two days they went away. Now there’s some of these little spots on my right foot and ankle, and seemingly nowhere else on my body. Anyone else have something like this occur? I’ll probably see my doctor in a few days and see what she thinks, but until then that anxious part of me is absolutely certain that I’m a dead man walking.",8.380843373493974,7.036543560240965,7.572379518072292,77.73037650602411,62.19277108433735,9.986746987951808,34.003012048192765,8.472884824447931,2.5881349397590365,685,22,129,7,8,212,107,166,0.105,0.848,0.048,-0.8624,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,2,1,7,3,0,0,7,0,8,9,6,0,2,19,20,13,2,0,3,0,2,1,1,0,3,0,0,1,14,6,0,0,3,0,1,6,1,0,0,2,4,6,13,3,22,16,6,36,0,0,4,0,5,15,0,8,16,88,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33880549443594665,0.0,0.10484972031080736,0.15364324462492196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28176913027585193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16656254264277884,0.0,0.16739569737908871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29011933808349993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15562619787942852,0.0,0.0,0.15348192644255346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25053082017039785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09904168845833317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12754884564572466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08522101090987573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07325882984451054,0.15029100446421628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14071951931501048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16238308634315404,0.14314587202875848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14175283209498954,0.1690480193481735,0.0,0.0,0.16167330248224535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2561158774625553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2389841928462106,0.13651040255421748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11544015027451268,0.14830607279726346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1558572393914433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960829992677459,0.1473267910980358,0.0,0.08743804641948562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14648102921890213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12028221466662425,0.0,0.0,0.1390067349899049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522832376151725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,OldDurtyBasturd,2019/03/08,"First post and I'm in a bad place. &amp;#x200B;

It feels like my esophagus has a lump inside of it. It feels like something is stuck and I am terrified. I have never posted here before and hate to add to the large number of posts here seeking reassurance but I'm really suffering.    


Esophagus cancer was mentioned on the news last week and it has been on my mind since. Some of the symptoms I have had for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

regurgitating food , chest pains, difficulty swallowing and in the last week it now feels like food is stuck down there, a lump in my throat feeling as well as further down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also started to feel like vomiting when I eat which has never happened before due to anxiety. I have however been experiencing intense anxiety the last couple of weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Health anxiety is new for me and my question is this:

Can anxiety create symptoms to match the illness you fear? I am convinced my time is up and find it so hard to deal with this right now.

healthanxiety,freebee123455,2019/03/08,"Fear of Neurological disease because I suck at balancing on one leg with my eyes closed. Ok so I was reading online about the Rombergs test, where you stand with your two feet together and fold your arms then close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for at least 20 seconds. I can do this fine.

Then the Sharpened Rombergs test. 
Stand with your heel to the big toe of the opposite foot (heel to toe) put your hands on your hips and close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for 21-31 seconds. Sometimes I can do like 1.5 minutes, other times I can only do like 15 seconds. 

Then the big one. Standing on one leg with your eyes closed for 15-30 seconds. Stand on your good foot, lift the other foot while bending it, has to be at least 6 inches off the ground. 

I CANT DO IT. I struggle to get to 10 seconds. Sometimes I get 30 but that’s after like 4 tries. 
My legs shake like crazy and I just fall to the side or else my knee gives way. 

This is scaring me as I’m only 22. :( ",1.605919145690315,3.4405800724637707,2.4541164505466604,96.87249427917622,79.19323671497584,5.130841596745487,22.48893974065599,5.750287758089431,0.01239710144927475,773,24,178,4,19,242,108,207,0.08,0.843,0.078,-0.5218,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,12,0,0,4,12,1,4,8,1,18,20,19,0,0,14,23,11,0,0,3,0,1,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,9,11,0,0,0,1,0,3,1,5,0,9,1,5,25,7,30,19,2,33,0,0,4,0,13,19,1,1,10,113,34,3,0.3668594631843721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11181706184538168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15323200355620484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2064094445421628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916689279478801,0.17596251284147227,0.0,0.15385215609485614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35845800584925674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3728901999768941,0.279013153072257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18439754388196836,0.0,0.0,0.1834793702826099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1836451608991788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36283338966152817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917605823247364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10695935159423024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245367471072843,0.0,0.17918419438311867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14559798298665952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Blue97,2019/03/08,"Does anyone have HA about others, but not themselves Hey guys, I'm 21 years old and have had crippling anxiety and stress about my girlfriend for about the last year or so. I constantly obsess over the idea of us getting married one day and her dying before me, leaving me alone. This leads me to incessantly Google risk factors for all sorts of different diseases all the time. I talk to her about it but I feel like she's beginning to be irritated with the constant questions. I've had sleepless nights over the possibility of COPD/ lung cancer (her mother was a heavy smoker throughout her childhood. Dementia (she has anxiety and 3 childhood concussions from roughhousing). Diabetes (she is overweight). Rheumatoid arthritis (complained of knee pain, made her go in, wasn't ra). Heart conditions (her father has high blood pressure) I am consumed by this. I have effectively no fear about myself, I could care less what happens to me. I really just do not know how to beat this. I'm not even sure if I'm being irrational. Is anyone else in these shoes?

healthanxiety,40ftunder,2019/03/08,"My hypochondria has returned severely after a night of heavy drinking I basically remember having episodes of debilitating hypochondria since I was 16 all the way up to recently. Now I'm 23 and I have had a relatively health anxiety free year. Four nights ago I went out drinking with my friends and we all had a terrible experience, blacked out, awful hangovers with a whole lot of symptoms and it's brought back my hypochondria full force. 

Now I'm worrying about stupid things again like whether or not I inhaled too much of the spray cleaner I used because it'll give me lung cancer, or how I'm so anxious it'll give me heart problems, maybe a clot or a stroke, also is the food I eat tainted with some carcinogen, am I being poisoned by my environment, etc etc it's never ending. 

I am for the most part physically ok, some slight headache and nausea but so much better since that first day post drinking. Yet my mental state is now a mess. 

I don't know what I'm expecting of this, just needed to let it out. I don't want to go through this again. It's taken away so much from me already.

healthanxiety,iceboxcookie,2019/03/09,"Convinced I have MS Hey. I can't seem to calm myself down right now... I've completely convinced myself I have MS.. my HA has been seriously terrible lately. I keep having panic attacks and I have embarrassingly broken down several times this past week at work. This post is long, I'm very sorry.

I'm a 21 yo female. I've had health anxiety for nearly all my life. For the past few months I've had pain through my left buttock and leg. Went to Dr who said it was pinched sciatic nerve which completely makes sense (my dad has also had the same problem and it sounds exactly like what I have) anyway I still obsessed over it being a blood clot or something serious. Sometimes when I am very stressed, my arms tend to go weak and I shake. I also will feel numb in certain areas of my body. Recently though,  the area around the left side of my mouth has felt weak/numb when I'm anxious. I always check in the mirror and it's not drooping or anything. It makes my anxiety go through the roof. I also am very aware of my speaking when this happens and I sometimes feel as if I slur my words. It never lasts very long and usually if I take anxiety medication it goes away fairly quick. However when googling this (I know, I can't keep googling things) like the first result is MS.. I can't shake it... Here are my other symptoms...

-very tired. I did just start on two anxiety medications so I'm trying to attribute my tiredness to that.
-I'm constantly tense. My jaw is nearly always tight and my shoulders are always up to my ears.
-tight chest/feels like I'm short of breath frequently. I think I'm like.. slightly hyperventilating at all times.
-frequent nausea. 
-blurry vision especially at night or after looking at my phone for a long time (having it now unfortunately)
-feeling disconnected
-dizzy when I'm extremely anxious
-i get very itchy on my thighs and on my arms. This has happened all my life. Usually if I'm wearing warm clothes, under a blanket, or I've just taken a hot shower (I've always had this and assumed dry skin but I learned that sometimes MS can cause hot itchiness that is often mirrored on the body) even worse, I noticed yesterday that in the places I've scratched really hard, I've even left small bruises and a few scratches.
-for as long as I can remember, I've had this thing where if I'm laughing really hard I lose my grip (can't hold a pencil or something) idk it's weird
-when I'm anxious (sometimes when I'm not) my hands shake
-ive always been pretty strong but for as long as I can remember, my arms shake like if I'm pouring a pitcher of water or something.
-i have also had excema on my hands for the last few years (Dr said due to stress and excessive hand washing which lines up) but it did start out mirrored
-I watched a video yesterday of a man who had been hardcore dealing with MS fears who went to the doctor and he was fine and all. He listed a few of his symptoms, a lot of which I shared. He also mentioned very weak muscles and twitching along with pins and needles in his limbs. I was thankful I hadn't really had any of that. But seriously just a few hours later, all these symptoms hit. Even worse today. My hands have been jittery the whole time I've typed this..

 I know there are more symptoms. I'm sorry, this post is a mess. I'm seriously so scared. Lately all I can think about is my health. I'm finding it hard to do basic tasks and function normally. I'm sorry that this was so long. I just wondered if anyone else deals with this.",2.1428665578209625,4.604890861918609,3.281546670914306,88.32187957948393,80.78779069767442,6.0373048741637465,24.250238929595408,7.304670390041555,1.139727158330678,2755,102,543,39,73,886,305,688,0.146,0.785,0.069,-0.9869,2,0,3,0,0,0,98.0,0,0,0,4,34,41,1,11,26,1,54,40,19,5,9,85,102,54,0,8,22,1,20,5,0,1,20,5,1,1,40,23,1,5,15,2,1,8,8,25,0,2,25,27,64,16,61,74,15,93,0,1,2,0,19,35,0,17,53,329,104,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21976149321375035,0.22865980954423246,0.0,0.0,0.037375370475129725,0.0,0.16818008427870368,0.18627088673688355,0.0,0.03843001505219228,0.05631404820251872,0.04522822701630861,0.04892694997787738,0.0,0.06252608160063589,0.05163767669405973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209858074811912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05646009543884939,0.0,0.0,0.11525114347628758,0.05939332493544645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11332477287301408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05625492109985943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04591287016143844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1089036832992666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06184641463545752,0.11115974917000136,0.039264155456063286,0.05277118719968843,0.0,0.05023336606885316,0.046749805755559135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02871485851069385,0.0,0.062471215418053776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09720367661485324,0.0,0.1477028045285274,0.0,0.0,0.1168419638915078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05412552232308839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09770373932601313,0.0,0.0,0.06041026583708346,0.08960111495558873,0.12399682304816098,0.0,0.17914588965579795,0.0,0.07764117139117221,0.13425586283325272,0.0,0.0,0.2918325780169281,0.04615340485857082,0.06148731003301874,0.0,0.046725884004738934,0.0,0.0,0.07337379990956573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107348677502488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043869352628254456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04238931799598709,0.0,0.0,0.05157718331896877,0.0538501190056236,0.0,0.06257347245944457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058482388086103065,0.06448490146710822,0.0,0.0,0.10493300316715017,0.0,0.0,0.057422556030971635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10527490703920762,0.05591510448647784,0.0,0.052590262490760924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10562828821166892,0.0,0.05426736535095378,0.0,0.12452021725055012,0.04693640095946406,0.10456101006076277,0.0,0.0550255575366654,0.0,0.0,0.050034437949746866,0.0,0.062090295578961174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12693500849194686,0.2174313710341064,0.18457304788422152,0.07780336940194993,0.0,0.043891932386291486,0.0,0.12591529909197555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285021281144581,0.04132383841213359,0.0,0.0,0.050600712384922635,0.0,0.0,0.07302730376596167,0.0704335900405574,0.05399891180162851,0.0,0.12819282417060535,0.06316959418289632,0.05209660963852244,0.0,0.0,0.03731491703798912,0.0,0.05368891916026209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1210635720658764,0.3174401159802965,0.0,0.0,0.044086405823945095,0.0,0.0,0.101898811025584,0.0,0.06136200322250525,0.0,0.0,0.05960286924152991,0.04001226877242337,0.0,0.11201992622915444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03539308750829758
healthanxiety,proflayton9999,2019/03/09,"Dont know whats wrong with me I really can't believe all of this is just anxiety. I did get told I had pots at the hospital. I remember this first starting when I was pregnant and I had a fear of hiv/aids all of a sudden. I have had 4 or 5 std tests (one I did myself) and they are all clean.  

Then I felt some lymph nodes. I thought I had   

cancer

 anemia,   

h ploy.  

 candida

low vitamin d levels,

kept thinking I was having a heart attack   

&amp;#x200B;

vision problems

I did get dx with low blood pressure.  

I get constant headaches/ dizziness when I lay down and try to sleep. I have to elevate my feet.

skin issues (seb derm, melasma, food allergies,  depersonalization derealzation everything feels like a dream

mental health issues (racing thoughts in the morning)

healthanxiety,DAMABANANA,2019/03/10,"Freaking Out and Anxious - Please send good vibes I just turned 18 and so far this year has sucked. During my two month break from university, I got heart palpitations for the first time in my life. That led to a google fest for me. I thought it was over the next day and was ready to just move on when I got really bad stomach aches and chest pain. I went to the ER and they said I was fine. I decided to take a break from school to talk with my GP and he said I just had anxiety. Its been 2 months since then and while the stomach problems have mostly dissipated, I have started to notice  random twitching all over my body along with headaches and some numbness in my middle finger. Today my left arm feels weak and sore. I am going to see my GP in a week but I am anxious. I feel like the boy who cried wolf at this point, while I feel like something is wrong, sometimes I feel unable to explain it properly. I'm trying not to actively thinking about these symptoms because I know anxiety has many effects but it I just can't rationalize that these symptoms are normal. I'm just holding on to the fact that there have been too many random symptoms within such a short amount of time for it too be some terrible illness.",4.4213798111837335,5.479329559670784,4.649726458484629,87.18572984749458,70.27572016460906,7.528346647300896,27.46284192689421,7.724431198458867,1.420984701040911,965,32,199,11,17,302,149,243,0.16899999999999998,0.778,0.053,-0.9751,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,2,12,13,1,0,10,0,17,17,7,2,2,42,38,16,0,2,8,0,5,2,0,0,10,2,0,1,13,13,0,1,10,0,0,5,2,9,1,2,12,8,25,4,30,25,5,37,0,0,1,0,9,15,1,5,17,127,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18304562779819747,0.2703139835651936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09989281060640937,0.07293027122584961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328909511620364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314168277014107,0.0771566727562565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419704587493729,0.1709389554951298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10176410103100074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06799308547475909,0.10034675645649728,0.19137102469552356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14177171657758494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06574996726295004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12998713841039708,0.0,0.08450392340589516,0.1168982584509898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2425884972992935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19098796929206147,0.12715635954899482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12723646947308373,0.0,0.1172199298468326,0.0,0.13620876216081934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12730336636790598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13132669978170058,0.11309666860343337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11447749779623942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07664322606677874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2276064471232941,0.0,0.0,0.12108013757729938,0.09533607075192344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09896586707122518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092103249199129,0.11832513339690542,0.0,0.08468045820094988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3730493625923774,0.08995295700583847,0.09616056757198643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07665925940249549,0.0,0.09497928236352247,0.13952386859698912,0.0,0.11340292351903047,0.0,0.0,0.08122641208976117,0.13013189055066965,0.11686903304449453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09596646197461807,0.0,0.0,0.11090571107788297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13080547390452976,0.0,0.07704300958651902
healthanxiety,balkun77,2019/03/10,"Irrational fear of rabies So I know that my fear is irrational but I can’t stop thinking about it! 

At the beginning of January (I mean very beginning like 4th) I was at a store where the owner had two cats. The cat that bit was very friendly at first, was rubbing against my mom and I. My mom had playfully ruffled its head and it had swatted at her, I then went to pet it and it bit me! Looking back it the incident I know the cat was most likely just annoyed hence why it bit me. 

At the end of January I (mistakenly) decided to consult dr google about rabies. This seemed to set something off in my brain, that night I couldn’t sleep. I was terrified that I was going to die of rabies. I went to the doctors and received a tetanus shot and was told to call the owner. 

My mom called for me and the owner told her that since the cats are in a public place they have to be up to date on their shots. While this was reassuring at first, a day later I kept having what if’ thoughts. Such as “what if the lady was lying about about the cat being vaccinated”

Either way it’s now March and I’m experiencing what I think is anxiety. Every time I think about my health, my chest tightens up and it feels like I can’t breath. I’m having awful muscle twitches in my legs, arms, and eyelids. I’m also having what I think is “pains” in my left arm (not the arm I was bit by the cat).  And the newest thing is I’m getting horrible nausea to the point where I feel close to throwing up (and I haven’t thrown up in years). Even now I can’t help but wonder “what if I’m just having a long term incubation period”

healthanxiety,themedhippie,2019/03/10,"Worried about stomach cancer Hi! 19 F here. For the past 6 months I get very nauseous very easily, especially after eating or when stressed. Since around November, I’ve started puking regularly. I’ll puke once a day for maybe a week, then be fine for a week. During bad episodes I puke anywhere from 3-7 times a day. I’ve been gaining weight since this happened. Haven’t vomited any blood (red color is from foods I have eaten). Diarrhea usually precedes the vomiting, and has a certain smell (smell only occurs in diarrhea RIGHT before I puke). Immediately after puking the nausea goes away until the next episode. Symptoms worsen before exams, presentations, stressful events. Ulcer has been ruled out. My brain is going straight to the assumption I could have cancer and I am terrified :(",4.465309523809523,7.530458721428572,5.075714285714287,75.2959523809524,76.07142857142857,7.447619047619049,28.619047619047624,8.447377352677275,2.7413904761904764,631,27,96,13,15,202,102,140,0.27,0.6579999999999999,0.07200000000000001,-0.9867,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,1,4,5,0,2,10,0,12,13,3,0,1,7,17,6,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,1,4,4,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,3,5,7,2,14,12,0,25,0,0,2,0,1,6,0,1,18,50,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10998752079295322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14398128659643453,0.0,0.0,0.1519583609978378,0.0,0.1350446394151411,0.0,0.0,0.2752545876179865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18055331886011344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12913479024486432,0.0,0.0,0.2086155147219805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16549855440971836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19557447087015967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450153289084388,0.0,0.09191954510961138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14302455423073052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16248775885504796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129097886470028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17201040831807096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1722459021712855,0.0,0.12300918768494708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543974109285922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13812353726127244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26758301727437583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11447912891663566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3705411184150013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1681079160402342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09431084384403628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17813177475692374,0.2669019036796138,0.0,0.0,0.2594732528724669,0.1969535524854456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16425299089925954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,thorbear88,2019/03/10,"Stomach issues I currently have some stomach issues that's making my HA flare up.

&amp;#x200B;

It started 3 weeks ago when i felt nauseus after eating lunch, i then focused on this and started googling (bad idea) Then i started feeling bloated after eating and i was having early satiety, belching/burping and nausea. I had good and bad days but was mostly afraid of stomach cancer... however, after reading cancer statistics (only one person between 30 and 35 got stomach cancer last year here in Norway) I no longer have this concern. But the problems are still here.  I went to the doctor on friday, he said it was reflux because of a weak muscle in my stomach and put me on Nexium 20mg for 4 weeks, so that my esophagus would heal.. I took this medication for two days and have stopped because of bad side effects (i got very bad nausea and diarrhea and stomach pain) 

&amp;#x200B;

I still have the following symptoms: Bloating and gas in stomach after eating, nausea and no appetite. I have lost some weight, but i have not eaten as much as i usually do. Is this Anxiety playing its tricks on me? Has anyone had similar experiences?

healthanxiety,Laurelles,2019/03/10,"Fuck lymph nodes I spent about two months completely paranoid about lymph nodes under my jaw before I discovered they were actually just part of the muscles in my neck. And now I've just discovered that a lymph node on the side of my neck is swollen despite feeling no symptoms at all and I'm freaking out all over again. You look on the internet and it's all HIV, cancer etc.

 I also live in a country where I can't speak the language and need someone with ID to help me go to the hospital, but I feel terrible about constantly asking my girlfriend to go when I don't even really feel physically ill just to discover it's apparently nothing.

I keep getting headaches one on side of my head, sort of around my left temple. I get short bursts of pain a few times a day and it’s been going on for over a week now. I think I drink enough water but I’ve been getting up earlier lately so am probably getting less sleep than usual.

healthanxiety,magnesium88,2019/03/10,"Red bump on perinium between scrotum and anus. (NSFW) I've had this sole, red bump on my perineum (between anus and scrotum) for at least a year or two now.  It is less than half a centimeter wide.  It is elevated and has loose, red skin hanging off it that can be ""flapped"" around. It was always painless, and I thought it was a skin tag, but it has recently begun to hurt slightly.  It has never changed size as far as I can tell.  

I am 30 years old and male.

I am not sexually active, and haven't had intercourse in 5 years.

I have had like a nagging pain there that comes and goes randomly most of the week and don’t know why. Of course the first thought is heart related because, 20 year olds have so many heart attacks. The logical part of my brain tells me it’s indigestion or I’m just backed up or something. But the terrible part of the brain says a heart attack is imminent. Just wondering if anyone has had similar experience and or have any tricks to prove to themselves that whatever it is your feeling is not a heart attack but more likely nothing serious at all.

healthanxiety,avemcc,2019/03/10,I need help :( vertigo I don’t know what to do. Ever since the end of January this year I have been feeling totally off balance and at times dizzy like I’m going to throw up. It feels as though I’m on a boat that’s rocking and that the floor is uneven. It’s especially worse when I sit down or am lying down as it feels like someone is rocking me back and forth. I’ve been to the hospital where they said I had vertigo but gave me medication that didn’t help. I’ve been to the doctor who looked at me eyes and everything and said it was vertigo. I went to a naturopath who said he wasn’t sure what it was but it could be an effect of the 20 mg of cirpalex that I’m taking. I’m seeing a physical therapist who doesn’t think the vertigo is coming from my ear canal but rather stress and neck tension. The rocking has been so bad recently and it hasn’t stopped at all. I want to get an MRI and I genuinely believe I have a brain tumor. Please help I’m terrified and don’t know what to do ,2.925418641390209,3.7203105781990544,4.6040568720379165,87.10804423380726,73.54976303317534,8.470268562401264,26.38894154818325,8.841846274778883,1.7231551974723542,776,26,176,15,15,263,114,211,0.146,0.757,0.097,-0.9311,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,1,7,6,0,2,13,0,24,11,4,1,4,30,48,18,0,4,5,0,3,2,0,0,7,4,0,0,18,10,0,1,7,3,0,4,6,3,0,0,14,10,14,3,21,32,2,23,0,0,3,0,12,10,0,1,10,112,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854434908307787,0.1287223997960396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17369259866382428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17210054834807126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13280059478876924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1230892256772795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15779571467994905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13654556035774126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13945222159900833,0.0,0.0,0.13855470694898553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338533019109692,0.11013641740774943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08054551552183897,0.0,0.08761624664194471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31000321261975144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16945150549312776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506357091010071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12946084293040475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15530630258659994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11431233921288232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16922827429294385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15222059745050565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4399422927171245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285056091439295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12752793549375402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306245842152529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12888990870909062,0.1765969467283412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14529988936667426,0.0,0.11591385230078377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1789989272233348,0.0,0.09878352382892304,0.15146758209032132,0.0,0.08989559451578483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09093126309398768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14291368111846206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15710860465297824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09927802632925124
healthanxiety,untiltuesday,2019/03/10,"Just a share I've been browsing here quietly for a good while and wanted to post just to share my HA experiences.

I'm 29 - turning 30 at the end of the month - and have suffered from Health Anxiety for about 5 years now. My mom died from alcoholism when I was 16 so I think that is probably my gateway. In the last 5 years, I've had C. Diff from antibiotics, been diagnosed as hypothyroid (severely high untreated TSH after a pregnancy really caused some complications), had emergency surgery after gallstone induced pancreatitis (though I had pancreatitis and liver blockages multiple times throughout a year and a half and during a pregnancy which weren't ever caught because I lived so close and got to the ER too soon for anything to reflect in my lipase and liver tests) and now have tachycardia that may be P.O.T.S but am in the process of cardiologist appointments to nail down the issue. I'm also possibly bipolar after having been prescribed Paxil and it putting me into mania, though I stopped seeing my psychiatrist before he made a definitive diagnosis. Scared of getting the diagnosis and then everything I experience from here on out being blamed on bipolar like doctors do now with my thyroid.

My HA is ruining my life. I spend hours Googling because I feel like I can't trust doctors after so many run-ins with them where they said pancreatitis was gastritis and sent me on my way assuming I was some kind of drug-seeker. Because of my Paxil experiences, I'm afraid to try any kind additional head med. I'm a mess, essentially, like many here.

Currently obsessing over the fact I've never had my cholesterol checked and every time I eat or drink anything other than water, I get fatigued to such a point that it feels like I'm drugged. Husband is diabetic so I've been able to check my sugar levels and there's nothing unordinary there. I check my blood pressure regularly as well. The overwhelming, sedating-like fatigue also comes with even minimal activity, which has also had me freaked out about heart failure. (All my ekgs have been fine, though I'm not even sure that rules out heart failure.) I've had iron tests, hormone tests (though I still suspect hormones to be the underlying culprit), am taking vitamin d for a deficiency, thyroid hormone and T4 is in range... everything is ""normal"". I was vegan for 6+ months, quit smoking several years ago and very rarely drink. I tested positive twice for ANA and one of the SS-A or SS-B tests for Sjogren's Autoimmune but my doctor still insists I don't have it, though another doctor at my clinic says I do because that's all you need... not sure how that works. Anyway, Sjogren's may also be a culprit in my ""potential reasons you're dying"" book.

Does anyone here have suggestions as to what helps them overcome their hypervigilance and keep themselves distracted from terrorizing themselves? I am in desperate need.

Also, if you have any mental illnesses that your HA piggyback's on, I'd like to hear your experience, too.

healthanxiety,Philthadelphian18,2019/03/10,My dog got Lepto and now I’m afraid I will have it. My dog contracted Lepto infection or Weil’s disease and I’m so worried about my dog because it’s life threatening to him. The vet told me she has an obligation to tell me it could be transferred to humans. I looked up the symptoms and I don’t have them but I am still nervous. Last time I had my blood checked I passed out and I am really nervous to do it again. I am pretty sure I don’t have it because I don’t have the symptoms (which says a lot for someone who has health anxiety).,0.23577257525083795,2.3799145304347853,2.327826086956524,94.12919732441476,86.30434782608695,5.625418060200667,22.759197324414714,7.010146845296331,0.7168595317725757,421,16,95,6,13,141,69,115,0.08800000000000001,0.845,0.067,-0.0472,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,1,0,5,4,0,3,5,0,17,6,1,0,1,10,22,7,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,5,1,0,1,7,5,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,3,0,0,3,2,19,1,8,16,1,8,0,0,1,0,8,2,0,2,5,67,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17661507043637506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2814726610940489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18433106794860984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18464798866074847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2454042257277682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1881900261488086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16307044930825912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19387282114728285,0.0,0.0,0.1962775873277132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23487799187854405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14790136134995344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1835972488217473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19561557054449133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843732392748028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2175924304698728,0.4799250710912735,0.0,0.0,0.2017907300800669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13462226973801242,0.0,0.0,0.22060636902053396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344598939511416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ThatOnePocketMonster,2019/03/11,"Eyelid Cancer? I've been having lots of problems with my eyes lately. 

1. My eyelashes curl inwards to poke my eyes
2. Eyelashes fall out into my eyes
3. Little bumps on the middle of my eyelid (where it touches the other eyelid) that cause discomfort when I blink. 
4. And now, a bump on the inside of my eyelid, touching my eye, causing discomfort. 

I've thought about it alot, and I can't think of anything it could be other than cancer. Am I right and should I go see a doctor? And what kind of doctor should I see?

healthanxiety,Riveris,2019/03/11,"Feta cheese with bonus mould Ok so My mom gave me an entire brined brick of feta cheese because no one else in the family likes feta i guess.  I've had it about two weeks now?  Anyways I opened it tonight and there was some small amount of mould on the rim, and also a little tiny bit on an exposed bit I avoided.  I just took some from what was still in the brine.  So I nibbled on some with some crackers, but now I'm kinda worried?  I googled it but nothing actually specified my specific case.  The closest case I could find had a lot more mould involved.  Is this okay to eat?  If not, are the crackers leaning against it ok?  I paid 2.47 for these crackers and I have like a third of the box on this plate.  I kinda need to know now because currently my plate is just sitting here in the open and I can't have that going on for too long.  Also is the little bit I ate ok?  I'm going out for breakfast tomorrow and I don't want to be sick.

healthanxiety,Cadahangel,2019/03/11,My First Post I am looking for some help I just want my life back. I know it's anxiety I have had test done that show me it is. The worst part is my left side of my mouth is pins and needles ans sometimes my left corner of my left eye feels stroke like. No change no droop and it's just a feeling if I pinch it I can feel it. The worst part of this is it had thrown me into DP/DR which has been not so great when I am a Dad to three kids and my wife. When I am in DP/DR and feeling like I do my libido is shot and it's hard to feel love when you question every feeling. I am just venting.

healthanxiety,Lmfao78,2019/03/11,"is it at all possible I'm gonna get rabies? It's been almost two days since this happened so if I did contract rabies it's probably too late. I was driving home and saw a cat lying in the street so I got out of the car to check if it was alive. there was blood coming out of its mouth so I'm assuming it had internal injuries from getting hit by the car. I touched its back/shoulder area to see if it was alive, but it was cold to the touch. anyway, I put hand sanitizer on when I got back to my car, but I know hand sanitizer can't really kill viruses, and after I put the sanitizer on, I noticed I had a papercut on my finger that I didn't see before. on the hand I touched the dead cat with! is it possible there was rabies virus on the cat's fur, like maybe invisible blood that I couldn't see??

I don't know why I didn't. I guess I thought they'd laugh at me. So now I can't shake the feeling that I have rabies and now I'm gonna die. ,-1.7339705882352945,0.0007920735294142389,1.7808823529411768,97.43397058823533,91.5,5.1647058823529415,15.852941176470587,6.6274283507984215,-0.4355647058823533,223,5,58,3,8,81,48,68,0.122,0.785,0.094,-0.1502,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,1,0,4,2,0,1,4,0,8,2,0,0,1,6,16,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,4,1,0,0,5,1,11,1,6,9,0,8,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,4,35,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2376745616336301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32244386087501353,0.0,0.0,0.31800111813445203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15709258779715002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16232103671897335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3422565517697138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33024555395401306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17074534731717927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396208234965319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3349729323412327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24665062554691924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2880097883808775,0.2803465245794927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20007212136854746
healthanxiety,ThunderboltKaiju,2019/03/12,"Brain Tumor Concerns I’ve been feeling super anxious lately and thought it would be worth venting out at the moment. I’m M/20 years old, and I’ve been feeling anxious over the idea of a brain tumor.

- Headaches have been present-ish, but they’ve been minor. I wouldn’t call them the worst headaches in my life.
- I feel like I’ve been seeing tiny streaks of light? It’s not huge glares, or anything that has messed up my vision, but I feel like I see tiny streaks sometimes. 
- I sometimes feel like I have double vision when reading? But that might be just a me problem since I need glasses.
- Left eyelid has a small twitch. Though the right eyelid has been starting a bit too.
- Been waking up earlier than normal.
- Not sure if my speech always had me stuttering. Might be overthinking it.
- My ears have been ringing for a while now. 
- I haven’t vomited, or suffered any seizures yet.

I dunno if I can chalk this up to allergies, since they hit hard this season. I just need comfort that this isn’t a reason to panic. This anxiety has been really messing me up, and even if I’m going to the doctor in two weeks, I’m a bit concerned for my health.",2.5009090909090896,4.812706428571432,2.9728733766233795,91.88349025974027,78.46428571428572,5.322727272727274,24.02110389610389,6.351523495107088,0.6285607142857144,896,31,178,7,22,277,125,224,0.16899999999999998,0.727,0.104,-0.9441,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,2,1,8,13,0,1,12,0,27,9,4,1,1,34,43,14,0,9,12,0,6,3,0,4,5,3,0,0,10,4,0,0,8,1,1,1,5,7,0,1,11,12,21,6,17,24,4,25,0,1,2,0,3,13,0,8,14,112,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10063942141994113,0.0,0.0,0.08224960187516875,0.0,0.09252580509175334,0.2732763328769857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09953088406405217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26409039636699944,0.0,0.0,0.27003860958808296,0.12350265365423435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12379662877352142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988580429871134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057777420514149,0.2592183927414085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06873821625677133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083467241829847,0.0,0.0,0.12856334118191778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13653692207434767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364359630399301,0.0,0.1314116570569472,0.0,0.08542999513937917,0.17726900566441506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566159703660532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17936459491910728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11850453367653545,0.0,0.0,0.12691583700916065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14190782339290586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157320475325855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12098192814477755,0.0,0.07748315304724031,0.12435591916669053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10328995387318117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19276170224248187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2001008521758032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23924369812772106,0.0,0.08560846456512422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113993187338728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11883197252403638,0.0960201527174464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11814979142422395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701815075089283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08591883975470611,0.0,0.0,0.07788731776257744

He confirmed that it is indeed a cyst and I don’t have anything like cancer. 

I wouldn’t saved myself a ton of anxiety if I would’ve simply gone into the doctor and had it looked at when I first noticed it.

healthanxiety,Vexxelian,2019/03/12,"Vision oddities Hey all, just wanted to ask if anyone had any similar experiences to myself. A few months ago, I (25) had my first panic attack that sent me to the ER. EKG came out perfect, sent me home. Soon after, I started getting more and more panic and anxiety symptoms at an increasing rate. Started diagnosing myself foolishly with all kinds of different things from heart problems, a ministroke, MS, brain tumor, the works. Went from 0 to hypochondriac in weeks. Went to my doctor and got some tests for thyroid and such, all fine. My BP is slightly high at 135/82 as well.

Most of the symptoms of everything has gone away, except my vision. I woke up one morning about 6-7 days ago with.. not what I would call ""blurry"" vision, but almost an otherworldly filter applied to it. Nothing is any more difficult to read, no flashing, no pain, no color changes, but things are just hard to *look at* and I've got a bit of tunnel vision going on. I've always had floaters in my vision and there aren't any new ones, but the floaters themselves are kinda blurry now and I notice them everywhere instead of just outside.

Could it just be eye strain from being in a constant state of stress for a month straight with poor sleep quality? I'm not asking for a diagnosis obviously, but I want to know if this is a shared experience from anyone else.",5.294141414141418,6.682639944664036,5.749374176548091,78.87691150636806,68.52569169960475,8.309969257795345,29.47057531840141,8.680891452615391,2.3318082564778213,1058,39,189,17,18,340,160,253,0.155,0.764,0.081,-0.9644,1,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,1,3,11,13,1,4,13,0,14,10,4,0,5,40,34,14,0,7,13,0,1,0,0,1,6,0,1,0,7,12,0,0,1,1,1,8,6,8,2,3,12,4,16,5,39,18,11,35,0,0,3,0,8,12,0,6,14,129,23,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19946000449255424,0.0,0.1126587577226652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09361421255632484,0.0,0.0,0.2295243236888129,0.0,0.08606697318599854,0.0,0.0,0.15733397158029053,0.11527594833664732,0.0,0.0,0.21035631274986746,0.12799210112487566,0.10570332520585317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12282768596424838,0.0,0.0,0.12559418287446672,0.11488146004152995,0.1286771778123295,0.0,0.0,0.11901669453649576,0.0,0.0,0.1215792875017287,0.0,0.0898270857819844,0.0,0.0,0.07255722373827697,0.0,0.0,0.11419147535169714,0.0,0.11754508535027425,0.0,0.11515491401130565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09398453525634573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10111336291314063,0.22010540120451896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09569775864177878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05877987201823704,0.0,0.06393989449276563,0.0,0.1799630512803637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100783501378891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333204477592679,0.0,0.11886902997984135,0.11285294179045413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171579462822902,0.06183049262055445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944769144442188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1796028305033357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10865923716824112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795278103375706,0.12808911113154414,0.0,0.0,0.15247429315516986,0.0,0.11971458211231645,0.26400368672780605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10765328679788516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11253669563103348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11258750051014736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592650054093451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12887552907509556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338741429190853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14948830646689554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13271820218648978,0.0,0.0902457273508932,0.0,0.1011566300654075,0.208588841510876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08190588982795992,0.0,0.0,0.0799212119257688,0.0,0.0,0.0

Just for some context, I’ve been feeling this constantly since December, and since October I’d say I’ve had pretty bad health anxiety after finding multiple lumps under my skin. In November I went to a dermatologist to get them all checked out and the dermatologist said they were all lipomas and nothing to worry about, but health anxiety forgets about that after a week and ever since then I’ve been scared of the potential of those lumps being sarcoma cancer. I’m not sure if this is what is causing my shortness of breath, as the shortness of breath never goes away, it’s there 24/7. Yesterday I went to a walk in clinic to get examined for my shortness of breath and the doctor noticed a slight wheeze which sent me into a spiral of health anxiety as, me thinking I have sarcoma, I thought it might’ve spread to the lungs or something. Anyways he does some tests to see the power of my exhale (don’t remember what it’s called) and then gives me abeuterol and tries the text again. I got the same results, but he said when he checked my breathing after the wheeze was gone. So, in short, is this shortness of breath from anxiety, or could it be a very minor case of asthma? The doctor also got a chest X-ray done and said everything looked normal.

healthanxiety,qsly,2019/03/13,"Weird chain of health anxiety (19, Male, 5’6, 97 ibs) So 3 weeks ago I had a respiratory virus and after I got better a week later I haven’t felt the same since. My brain was felt so foggy and I couldn’t remember most of the things that were going on because I was so zoned out and it made me think I had dementia or something so my mind was set on that, I got real anxious and scared that I had dementia. Then a week goes by, my right hand and foot start having a burning sensation and of course look up online on what causes that and now I think I have diabetes or that I have nerve damage from exercising. it’s been like this for 4 days and I still have the burning sensations but they come and go and I’m anxious about it.",2.016680161943324,3.6407797368421058,3.6423684210526335,89.77388663967614,77.28947368421052,7.045344129554657,21.56072874493927,7.882392219407189,0.7734406882591087,568,15,127,9,13,189,95,152,0.078,0.88,0.042,-0.4497,0,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,1,1,7,5,0,1,7,0,14,6,3,2,0,27,27,18,0,1,3,0,3,1,0,0,3,0,0,1,11,12,0,0,5,1,0,3,2,3,0,0,13,4,17,2,13,13,2,21,0,1,1,0,2,6,0,3,12,84,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14530482150028146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12539803363263105,0.37036494572652573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09992385739033807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14497355188890154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18298846799363566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16839056722101833,0.0,0.14120220779245893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10571457140661884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3147770146831041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1863185550337228,0.0,0.2622029324572225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17423885331736969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08008282918942011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1376511669508865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1551046744587809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16551205233237415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18657637395981794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18568893525883734,0.13998642969772446,0.0,0.0,0.1641121002936919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355959743672413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12619330469318873,0.0,0.0,0.1160231257445406,0.0,0.13090639208995342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10890088839019596,0.21006610219403185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3944592101232238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,socsrocks,2019/03/13,"Positive thinking for others whose HA is cancer based (the what ifs) So my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer. Today I’m worried about lymphoma and brain cancer. A month ago it was lung and digestive cancer(s). Before that leukemia and before that bone cancer. You get the gist. 

My dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it. Before you freak out, he was older, active but poor poor diet his whole life. History of alcoholism. I mention this because it’s good context for my issues. My health anxiety spirals every year around this time (Jan-Mar) when he was sick. 

Even though I know many many statistics, about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that, it doesn’t always stop the worrying, as many of you are well aware. 

I tend to catastrophise. If I feel bad, it must be cancer, and since it’s cancer, I’ll die a painful death in a couple months. 

I typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly (duh) but today I stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago. Today he announced he was cancer-free. 

The world isn’t perfect, and it isn’t always fair. There are lots of what ifs. But I think it’s so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and NOT fact. 

So you go through the thing, your lymph nodes are swollen. You’re probably a little sick with a cold, or maybe you’ve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check. So you probably don’t have lymphoma. Okay, but what if you do? Honestly, you’d probably be fine. This is not ALWAYS the case. But if we go by percentages, 99% of your worries are not cancer, or malignant, or serious at all. 75% of that 1% of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment. There’s variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer. Treatments are so plentiful and effective. Maybe you DO have brain cancer, but so? That 27 year old kid did. He’s alive and well. 

To be abundantly clear, I think it’s most important to challenge false conclusions, first and foremost. Challenge your worries. If you’re in a rut though, and you just can’t shake the feeling that “THIS TIME is has to be cancer, I just know it has to be”: stay optimistic! We are a community of worriers. Challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios, even if they’re within the worst case. 

I’m here with you, if you’re scared of something today. And I’m so positive that we will get through it just fine, I want you to be positive of that as well :)",2.3151358395198223,4.837076412731008,3.4243069815195097,87.19278964618546,80.56057494866529,6.867303743484443,24.149778865897964,8.012643519586192,1.5600298846943614,1971,72,381,38,52,634,221,487,0.237,0.599,0.16399999999999998,-0.995,0,1,2,0,0,0,77.0,3,15,1,8,27,26,0,3,21,3,42,33,6,2,5,76,59,50,2,11,25,1,2,0,0,2,26,0,0,2,33,25,3,3,11,0,3,4,8,10,4,1,9,3,35,16,50,41,7,43,0,0,0,0,32,14,0,15,24,250,68,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13337549740423615,0.08039906748479878,0.0753329866126856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18779467385811385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151030291808514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06697154630629235,0.0,0.0,0.07068200771618191,0.0,0.12562949721872593,0.0458601237191585,0.0,0.19204813830091735,0.0,0.07895030067038034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519480532637696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08324167854836254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15271577741215506,0.07807790802764553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09937874146798316,0.0,0.06338536825135524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607811535667648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06399145629114958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07861019243165977,0.0,0.08551103018014164,0.06310019952702597,0.0,0.08294245102498139,0.0,0.07449052492848189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2399011280740905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0785216258858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08268998819082296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053137885229405976,0.0,0.07540123310749247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395871203377182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22881729997694955,0.15115931693078768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1801460166001751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578845736742432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08005109583944946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07653698035603128,0.2433352497279584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08562935635525792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08522206574735877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07531936236087887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06223186657026322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05791650479576747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08018624386943715,0.0,0.1257929812786844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049980138328642634,0.1928199668711188,0.14782816520740955,0.0,0.1316034158672977,0.0,0.28524079317306394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044373197213779865,0.0,0.06034577611012627,0.0,0.27056684140832205,0.0,0.0,0.08399273288281837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30560295843971663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14533890627086102
healthanxiety,thebooksparrow,2019/03/13,"I've been worrying about aneurysms since last night and its been a really rough time. How do I get past this? Hey everyone, I'm so glad that subreddit exists because it's so comforting to know that I'm not the only one who struggles with this type of anxiety (since I was a little girl).

Recently though, I have been really sick - like since before Thanksgiving. I've had bronchitis, the Norovirus (ended up in hospital), tonsillitis, the flu, then the stomach flu again, and now I'm at home sick for a week because the cold I've had since early November never went away and it has turned into walking pneumonia and strep throat. My throat is covered in huge white blisters and it's just so disgusting.

But anyways, I was put on a really high antibiotic and Prednisone 3x a day, and it's just made me feel anxious and so strange. I started feeling like my pulse in my groin and it really freaked me out, so I Googled (I want to punch myself lol) and the first thing that came up was aneurysm. Then my husband told me it was probably the steroid making my nerves jittery, so I googled again (I rly need to stop) and it said that some people have experienced something called ""phantom vibrations"" or something like that. The thing is though, I'm pretty sure this has happened to me before and I've never paid it any attention.

I had a rly bad panic attack right after that, but I took a shower and calmed down and was fine. But today, my hip and leg have been aching, and I'm not sure if it's my fibromyalgia acting up bc I'm sick or if it's just a psychosomatic symptom or even possibly the Prednisone  making me feel this way.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? Because I know it's probably nothing, but I've just had a rough time today with being worried about it And having the thought of aneurysm in the back of my brain.

Bless you if you made it to the end of this post.",5.563586956521739,6.061129271739134,5.945108695652177,80.93684782608695,67.42391304347825,9.334782608695653,31.21739130434783,9.318704503766252,2.598922826086957,1484,56,292,27,23,477,183,368,0.109,0.8079999999999999,0.083,-0.8320000000000001,1,0,2,0,0,0,42.0,0,2,0,1,22,16,2,2,21,1,24,12,6,5,5,59,52,38,0,5,16,1,5,3,0,0,6,1,2,1,29,22,0,1,7,0,1,6,4,6,0,2,22,10,28,10,28,29,1,51,1,0,1,0,9,17,0,7,29,186,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06523288590715998,0.0,0.07338303346658095,0.10836893697520347,0.0,0.06707360369787474,0.0982873971459265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912953357854037,0.09012551927842052,0.07376107838486543,0.08009410060187361,0.1754265730944506,0.0,0.16325171237659974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10708500350264698,0.0979510457361911,0.10971364852555912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06186425501825792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08013376142730977,0.0,0.1699237097095919,0.0,0.0,0.06335813716555884,0.0867704477511566,0.0,0.09166128643935116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14550901722633794,0.06852946580986312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08159450210837531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05011731162142634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482693637234358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10135095591545416,0.09622147610923826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10543670681723168,0.07819239294151717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14059361453120414,0.09614292954627286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18153476871857468,0.1280625357616304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07112782244162133,0.1479679002167778,0.0,0.0,0.09001993751734944,0.0,0.09204346627004913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500185694469936,0.07295595216560864,0.0,0.11254834846218936,0.0,0.0,0.091572103988283,0.06650292502827426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10814201336978982,0.09187047395751156,0.09759110304687027,0.20684863988336288,0.0,0.0,0.09643200145066036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458102929241576,0.0,0.0947152311112616,0.0,0.0,0.08192017496438757,0.09124747598381457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.317403507429023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14769685350391276,0.0,0.0,0.067896829581492,0.0,0.0,0.08019832858204548,0.0,0.10028255454831317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18081800797398695,0.09970371573140883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274577807286861,0.0,0.1884933745344608,0.0761544314404307,0.11187030077470686,0.0,0.18185303045817044,0.09166128643935116,0.1065771790953054,0.0,0.10433980854082196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05657956770263201,0.07614149630740136,0.07694595249788443,0.0,0.0,0.08892424916738041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19483476921733955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,-une-ame-solitaire-,2019/03/13,"Final exams coming up. Host of issues... Hey everyone, I’m in the middle of a panic attack right now and this is my best option as it’s the middle of the night and I can’t talk to anyone right now.

I have final exams next week and I’ve been very stressed out lately, and although most people tend to overeat when they’re stressed, I am the type of person who feels nauseous and does not like the thought of food during stress. 

Anyways, this past week or so I was sick with a sore throat and developed a sore neck that still keeps reappearing. On top of that, today my left leg started hurting in a specific spot and I’m pretty sure something happened to my muscle. My anxiety has been elevated because after a night out over the weekend, my friend took pictures and although all our eyes had a white reflection from the flash, one of my eyes was especially white in multiple pictures. I have read about concerning disorders that can be a cause to the white flash, so I immediately went into panic mode. I have been experiencing problems with this eye and suspicions of glaucoma by one doctor, and overall my eye has been especially red lately. I can’t help but think something is seriously wrong but I keep reassuring myself that it’s probably just because I’m a heavy contact lens wearer and my eyes need some oxygen and relaxation. I made an appointment with my eye doc to make sure. In the meantime, I’m trying my best to calm down and forget everything so I can study and not jeopardize my future. :) ",5.7739473684210525,6.746636555555559,6.341717836257312,76.59348684210528,67.125,9.257602339181288,30.782894736842106,9.414487439383343,2.767420833333333,1200,45,217,23,19,391,166,288,0.115,0.767,0.118,0.8365,0,0,2,0,0,0,26.0,1,0,0,3,10,19,1,5,18,0,20,16,9,3,3,45,38,24,0,2,6,0,1,1,1,0,5,0,0,1,10,21,2,2,4,3,0,3,4,10,0,2,11,12,24,9,33,26,5,39,0,1,10,0,9,17,0,4,20,142,34,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08216259583144835,0.0,0.0,0.07509830448882894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122185815128117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309430980829228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22542453281780095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11033192240431286,0.0,0.09251771812744787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1230925359155626,0.10993097941842443,0.09398862556110346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10262766303517208,0.09652641498426068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05430591608364721,0.0,0.0,0.2353083129176028,0.0,0.0,0.12987149344913787,0.0,0.08297888215612285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497564981358866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07198961191746849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497656584247247,0.0,0.0,0.11210027499009488,0.0,0.1909285009552328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2423093293164616,0.0,0.1166930982724643,0.0,0.0,0.05247142189649966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10162681431241354,0.07169198294129524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07963757086034559,0.0,0.0,0.11422374565387285,0.20157988552976674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14555738699118104,0.0,0.0,0.2520273155621764,0.0,0.0,0.1025278107759205,0.07445934969689648,0.0937796943885936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10926692421398504,0.11579802846908248,0.10276965908847084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10743153496704494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834422456549372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16536733774497125,0.0,0.0,0.07602002129935619,0.0,0.08577175154556113,0.0,0.3690875006750116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20245111446612546,0.0,0.0,0.08632603732059861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881916626786992,0.0,0.08526556447224745,0.0,0.0,0.10180498363469244,0.0,0.11932809638962792,0.07291922727296561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08861828612156092,0.0,0.0,0.17230356656838425,0.0,0.0,0.09956316601822937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11742774098715485,0.0,0.0

I'm currently going through a stage where I'm super worried about developing diabeties. Putting anything with sugar into my mouth can cause my anxiety to skyrocket because my brain can't stop thinking about how that food could be the thing that ends up giving me diabeties.

healthanxiety,Hillsider16,2019/03/14,"Eating Beets / Red Stool I had a fairly large amount of cut up beets for lunch today around noon, along with a small cup of beet lemonade. Around 5pm, my stool had quite a red/dark pink tint to it, and the toilet water was that color as well. It is now 830 and I have gone again, same result. I am aware that beets can discolor your stool, however 5 hours seems pretty fast. I thought it normally takes food upward of 24 hours to go from being consumed, to being excreted. Am I worried for nothing? This has never happened before, and I have eaten beets before, but never quite as much as I did today.

healthanxiety,shadowofassassin,2019/03/14,Worried I have ovarian cancer. The more I'm on social media the more I hear about 'silent killer' cancers. I read that a common symptom of ovarian cancer is being bloated and feeling full quickly. I feel full a lot and never really finish my plate and I often have a bloated stomach. I pee pretty frequently too. I just feel so stupid going to a doctor with these sort of symptoms. I also have a fear that a doctor will wrongly say that I'm fine and then I'll be all relax while the cancer spreads inside me. There's so many different types of illnesses to consider and be at risk of. It drives me insane. ,2.8252954545454543,4.957433908333332,4.5945454545454565,81.55227272727275,76.58333333333334,6.696969696969697,25.07575757575757,7.686295010490155,1.5989166666666663,479,17,85,7,11,162,79,120,0.266,0.6629999999999999,0.071,-0.9815,1,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,0,9,6,1,2,9,0,8,11,2,0,2,15,15,10,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,1,9,2,0,0,5,6,0,0,3,2,0,2,1,4,0,0,0,5,11,2,10,11,6,13,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,3,7,65,16,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1629221555849838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21285363670754426,0.0,0.4170509070457493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22925197313368484,0.3090347918364796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157839907379002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2296175980047889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17320326760479213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20654941696129908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15712850692560384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072658230401616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20378431694302726,0.0,0.1305141326515179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16201362494884708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20767624781718488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42350525931258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2068968765486603,0.0,0.0,0.22274588178015586,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,oldworldsnorder,2019/03/14,"I’m convinced I have a urethral stricture In may of last year I had a type of explosion in my bladder. It came with an insane feeling of urgency, frequency and a feeling that my
Bladder was in the grip of a vice. I also had an electrical type feeling in my bladder and Perineum.

I saw a urologist who thought I had a urethral stricture. I was sent for a cystoscopy that showed everything was ok. That was in September 2018. 3 months later the urgency and frequency decreased but then what accompanied was pelvic pain, tailbone pain, I had to start sitting down to urinate and I had to start milking my urethra to empty it - at this time I was also tapering from 6mgs of clonazepam. I hit 2mgs when this started. I finished my taper on clonazepam in the middle of February.

I now have all of those symptoms but they’re at full force now. For the past two weeks I had a slight burn at the end of urination. Peeing didn’t hurt but at the end I had a sharp/burn pain in a specific area in the top of my penis/urethra. 

For the past two weeks I’ve had a feeling that there’s a marble stuck in my urethra. Sometimes I can feel pressure in my urethra when I move about. Sometimes I get a sharp stabbing pain down my urethra too. The side of my penis hurts too.  I
Also have to gently milk my urethra to get the rest of the urine out. 

My fear is that the cystoscopy has caused a stricture. It’s done the very thing that it was supposed to rule out. There was no blood after it was done, nor did it burn when I peed, but the tip of my penis was very swollen for an
Hour or so. Apparently it’s extremely rare for someone to get a stricture from a routine cystoscopy, especially in the area I think mine is. But I’m 100% convinced that I have one. It’s making me very ill. 

I see the urologist in 5 days time. I’m in a chronic pelvic pain support group and apparently this is a very common symptom. But other guys have the same symptoms and have a stricture. 

I don’t want another cystoscopy but I’m guessing I’ll have to have one as it’s the only way to treat a stricture. I can’t believe I’m in this mess. I’m so upset and frustrated.

Then it seems like for a few feet out, I have to make a conscious effort for things to remain focused. Or, it's kind of like, if I zone out, things within a few feet will go out of focus, or be doubled. Everything beyond a few feet stays focused, however.

healthanxiety,Hecate90,2019/03/14,"Absolutely terrified and think I have cancer. I know I shouldn't be posting this but I have gotten myself into such a state. I can't stop crying and hyperventilating, I feel sick, I can't sleep, the list is endless. In February I got a letter from my doctor telling me my urine sample contained a small amount of blood which was not due to infection and I would need to be investigated. Said urine sample was taken about 3 or 4 days after my period ended. I still haven't gone back to the doctor out of fear of being told I have something serious.

However on Tuesday 12th March, I went to the toilet and noticed a significant amount of blood in my pee and I was extremely frightened. My period is due this week however it still hasn't arrived for some odd reason. I'm definitely not pregnant and surely blood in my urine isn't normal. I was hoping this was just spotting due to hormones but I doubt I am that lucky. I'm shaking as I type this. What if it's kidney, bladder, ovarian, or any other cancer? Isn't this the warning sign? I really don't want to die, I've finally found happiness and I'm doing well in life it's just NOT FAIR!!!

healthanxiety,goldenglisten,2019/03/14,"Substitute for food when there is no appetite? I was diagnosed with a kidney infection on Tuesday (3 days ago) after having a UTI from the following Monday to Friday. 

Saturday was when it started getting uncomfortable. I took my mum to eat at a lovely Indian restaurant to which we ordered to our hearts content then I only took a few bites and was full! 

We then proceeded to go and see a show at the theatre, and to be completely honest I couldn’t wait for it to end, I was fidgety all the way through! 

Monday was chills and fevers and an ice pick head ache just about a mm above my right ear (which I still have) 

Tuesday I got a drs appt, to which I got told off for not eating as I had a dangerous amount of ketones in my urine. She also told me to eat...but never specified what when I told her that I physically couldn’t hold down food. 

Now this is day 7 and I’m prepared to drink full fat milk for my antibiotics, there is no soup in the house, I’ve lived off of cranberry juice for the last 5 days.

healthanxiety,andyroo5000,2019/03/14,Heart anxeity I’ve had a bad month so far. I was put into a psychiatric ward for a while against my will and now that I’m out I have to go to court ordered group counseling. Anyway my anxiety problems basically all surround my heart. Even now I have chest tightness and a horrible pain in my left arm. I can’t convince myself it’s not a heart attack no matter how hard I try. I’ve been to 3 cardiologists and been to the er at least 20 times and had ekgs every time. Had a stress test and an echo and it all came back negative. I can’t stop convincing myself that something has happened since then and I’d go back to the er but I’m afraid of being admitted again. I’m a 20 year old male and have my whole life ahead of me but I’m to paralyzed by fear to live it. I “know” I’m having a heart attack every time it happens and it’s hard to even imagine it getting better and being happy. I was on Klonopin and it seemed to help but they took me off cold turkey in the hospital and put me on all new meds. I’m just scared. If anyone has any advice I’d really appreciate it. ,1.2992368475774612,3.0539643842794746,3.503031815346226,89.37016011644835,79.82969432314411,6.807319609066335,21.821792472447488,7.793537801064563,0.862643002703265,840,25,188,14,21,288,130,229,0.116,0.759,0.126,0.6532,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,1,2,11,13,2,4,12,0,18,8,6,1,3,33,34,20,0,2,6,0,3,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,10,15,0,2,4,0,0,6,5,9,2,0,9,4,19,4,23,22,5,34,0,0,0,0,5,11,0,2,16,119,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259078093536212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07835294592852622,0.0,0.08814230389042392,0.0,0.0,0.08056388078936946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2621567427157517,0.0,0.17719276729668024,0.09620314426352444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10190193973935276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13177996728182345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15220227118359936,0.0,0.1941541393090228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12965353172966498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06019722955604676,0.0,0.13096335103881246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2037757571640796,0.12265288523731666,0.206427382696068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5461408011088961,0.07722894081389856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06332140969426026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12518590029637014,0.0,0.08138266492753526,0.0,0.0,0.10174058516776233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12798245707922934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196679446129666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112793345513262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209030741540232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12260125674287688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11024912772563733,0.0,0.2316540588499039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07381231231120396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153544293889006,0.0,0.0,0.10489115054657154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09531043855129033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870130008409867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09632833524934514,0.1319831013834723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20155556907485714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12801267082915846,0.07822621260571881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286380217624403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419732932484363
healthanxiety,pinkblue_purple,2019/03/14,"Shoulder’s going crazy. Hi.

My very first post here, but been reading it for a long time and have a quick question.

Lately, I’ve been dealing with a lot of your common symptoms, such as: headache, nausea, stomachache, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, numbness, random quick pains all over, etc..

But yesterday night I was laying in my bed and suddenly, completely out of blue, my left shoulder started to hurt. And it is very painful when touched. I can move my arm completely and it’s not painful. But when pressed or even just touched gently, it hurts. I haven’t injured it anywhere as I usually spend my days on my laptop working while layind down. And of course I started googling, constantly think about the pain and touch it every 5mins to make sure if the pain is still there. And now it feels like my arm is not painful, but has a weird sensation.

Also, read somewhere that anxiety can cause these random bone, muscle or joint pains all over the body. So was wondering if anyone else had this kind of pain or am I going insane?

Thank you and have a lovely day!",5.596183368869936,6.915673000000003,4.862022032693677,85.77593283582091,67.75621890547264,7.732906894100925,30.775053304904052,7.957251820313856,2.0146187633262262,847,33,160,10,14,253,132,201,0.241,0.682,0.077,-0.9909,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,2,0,2,14,17,0,0,8,0,15,20,8,2,3,34,25,24,0,2,12,0,5,1,0,0,11,0,1,0,10,10,0,0,4,2,1,3,3,12,0,1,5,6,15,5,18,20,4,33,0,2,1,1,6,8,0,10,22,104,25,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07174487049640971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06863155477217095,0.0,0.0,0.06273065432834657,0.09192338558349138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09965288658474046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921617835826966,0.0,0.0,0.1881284624150893,0.09694979642544058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157172116265458,0.0924919902357662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494517978741076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005568544784883,0.05925576057197258,0.0,0.0755885645035799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04536248418676638,0.06409225081134236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763113389569706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1019739444426278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10631243639609113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19208303720884687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09342412901974964,0.0,0.0,0.1012021701511618,0.0,0.0974753619280797,0.0,0.0,0.04383010577283784,0.0,0.0,0.07939474977422115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07627229064851708,0.08097108413632283,0.0,0.0598853067404883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095352604265838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419123577281612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7637027394016103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08592195181235847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10050107646739816,0.0,0.17947809953509278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12700115430363212,0.0,0.0716463325499151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455511057411541,0.09324799894413477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08259730819974243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05748560316640613,0.0,0.0,0.0523134048314796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09880814619387117,0.1480481646476873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09729184290690934,0.0653134222780535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Really_Just_Really,2019/03/15,"A small victory I don't post very often and never before on this sub but I wanted to share a small victory.  As you can imagine I spend a lot of money on doctor visits and tests that turn out to be just fine. I have spent too darn much and so I've challenged myself to just wait things out no matter what. My first challenge arrived quickly.  

On Tuesday I got a rash very likely from sweating/rubbing because I noticed it right after the gym and it was around my neck and chest where my shirt collar rests. It was red, itchy and painful.  I DID NOT Google.  I started to,  but I stopped.  I put some hydrocortisone cream on it and ignored it. Ever so briefly thought about going to urgent care (autoimmune? My joints hurt... is it infected? Etc.) 

It's almost gone today. Four days. Granted the source of the rash was clear. And I'm still worried about the size of the lymph nodes in my neck. And random belly pains make me think of tumors.... but this one thing..... I waited out this rash and it was fine.

Does anyone know what this could be? I read that it can be caused by stomach cancer. Why does stomach cancer cause such frequent burping?

healthanxiety,juicy_cantaloupe,2019/03/15,"Last month filled with illness and anxiety, not being able to sleep well, and surgery possibly coming up. Need advice on how to cope. I've had really bad panic attacks and anxiety since I was around 14, up till the age of 16. After my first major panic attack, I was hospitalized for a week, after which they concluded it was anxiety and referred me to a psychiatrist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've essentially been free of panic attacks since, but have had periods of anxiety, centered around my health. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last month has been especially terrible. It started with an eye infection that caused an eye edema, where my left eyeball developed a dent and a bump. The ambulance ride was nerve-wracking, and I was given antibiotics at the ER and then discharged.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I got stomach flu. Terrible week. I felt weak, dehydrated, and completely sapped of all energy. More antibiotics, I felt better after a few days. This is when I started to become hyper-aware of my heartbeat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I got sick again for 2-3 days: fever, cold, sore throat. Had some relief, but then went out on the weekend, walked home in skimpy clothes in freezing cold and rain, bronchitis for another week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, I started getting wisdom tooth pain. It's an infection and abscess. Dentist said I need to have it pulled. Terrified of the surgery, and especially the anesthesia. Haven't had it before, scared of an allergic reaction or complications. Dental anesthesia can briefly cause palpitations, which sucks because I'm so worried over the health of my heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around 4 weeks of constant health-related drama, worrying, palpitations, panic. The worst is probably the poor sleep. I cant fall asleep easily because I keep checking my heart rate and freak out when it slows down. My resting heart rate is around 60, so I really freak out when there's a long time between beats. This leads to palpitations, poor breathing patterns, tingling, twitching, you name it.

healthanxiety,Haleywilde,2019/03/15,"How to go about requesting a heart check up? Hi everyone, I guess I’ve always been a little bit of a hypochondriac, but serious health anxiety is a new thing for me. I was required recently to take a 9 hour long first aid certification class for a new job, in which we discussed heart attacks and cardiac arrest for hours on end. Following that, I’ve been seeing deaths of young people around my age such a Lotte Van Der (19) and Felicite Tomlinson (18). I am 21, and now I’m in constant fear of an underlying heart issue that I am unaware of. I would like to get whatever tests are necessary to easy up some of my anxiety, because I know that I have never had any tests done regarding my heart. So my question is how do I go about this? What do I request? My mom suggested I say that there is a history of heart attacks in my family, but I’m not sure if that’s necessary. At 21, am I going to receive a lot of push back regarding the necessity of these tests or is it pretty straight forward to get? Any advice would be great, thank you so much.

healthanxiety,KJB1988,2019/03/15,"Enema side effects? 30. F. Australia.

I was administered a fleet enema at the hospital last night (18hrs ago to be exact) for painful constipation. I wasn't completely impacted as I could still pass gas and small stools. 

I am having really bad abdominal pain and cramping today. It's freaking me out. I have had paracetamol, buscopan and simethicone but the pain is probably still a 7 out of 10. I've had two fleet enemas before and definitely experienced *some* cramping the next day but not as bad as this. Is this normal? I understand my muscles are sore from pushing out the stool (and there was a fair bit of it). 

No other symptoms besides the cramping and pain.",3.2196864111498265,6.119677780487809,4.816916376306619,76.17603658536588,80.13821138211381,8.71753774680604,28.29790940766551,9.23628265651192,3.2490933797909403,529,24,90,16,14,177,86,123,0.22,0.732,0.048,-0.973,0,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,1,4,7,0,0,8,0,13,12,0,1,1,18,14,11,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,5,9,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,7,0,1,5,1,8,0,12,7,2,16,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,8,61,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14468584284867986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725659517003597,0.0,0.0,0.1388893127467131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17819539625603126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17113443781680926,0.0,0.0,0.1303189343655333,0.0,0.0,0.10526424180166634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13304715227262667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735877145832338,0.15317214224919642,0.1599222283515433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6947159259627744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1759801782030839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10456375052148646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26069749755383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16964943711321145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15471471663939948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15944350260392806,0.1699191397179992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,hxnglex,2019/03/16,"freaking out about stomach issues. so two months ago, I was feeling this weird burning/cramping sensation in my stomach and was prescribed omeprazole and took that for about three or four weeks.

the pain went away and then two months later, I found myself feeling the same thing again.

I would feel a pain/nauseous feeling when I get hungry, get full easily after one bite, and would feel nauseous again after eating.

I'm not sure what is going on, I have a doctor's appointment this tuesday but cannot seem to stop thinking about worse case scenario.",9.375346534653461,8.582537029702973,7.592950495049507,76.6032871287129,59.8910891089109,9.268118811881187,37.031683168316825,7.554174236665415,2.8644201980198014,444,17,74,3,5,131,74,101,0.114,0.807,0.079,-0.6527,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,0,4,0,7,5,2,0,1,21,21,9,0,2,3,0,5,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,5,5,1,1,8,0,0,3,2,3,0,5,5,5,7,1,11,14,2,21,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,13,53,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15140783817652362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16047640225622975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17482559102725892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1747755925760241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4318193072520349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18727826206917625,0.0,0.0,0.17847654968655582,0.0,0.09707210448544876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17827546823599902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726689630442655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11574151501124408,0.0,0.363495952423051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554939552888835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14280016737602502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16098117167659678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134748862179395,0.10944459405741548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1897700274102899,0.0,0.0,0.3337022553865425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13700902612159294,0.0,0.0,0.15833743532321132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17406432563542254,0.2426691597227988,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Lilneso,2019/03/16,"Left side of face slightly numb Yesterday during the afternoon I took a nap. When I woke up my left side of my face felt slightly numb. To describe it, it’s essentially feels like when you go outside into cold air, the slightly numbness you feel. I till can feel things on my face, and of course I’m not showing any other symptoms. First thing my anxiety goes to is stroke, but no other symptoms have popped up. I’m having some crazy health anxiety over this. I’m not really looking for advice, mostly posting this because of my anxiety and seeing if others have gone through something similar to this.

healthanxiety,MightyJoeTYoung,2019/03/16,"I’m having bad anxiety about HIV and it’s cause me to be super depressed, even though I keep telling myself I shouldn’t worry. So this is kind of a rant because I’m sitting in my car outside work, trying to find the strength to go in...this anxiety has just been CONSUMING me for the last two weeks and I feel like it’s at its worst today.

I’m not sure why I’m so worried about it, but for the last two weeks I’ve been SUPER worried about having HIV. Two weeks ago I found a cyst behind my ear and went to the doctors thinking it was a swollen lymph node. He told me it was a cyst and sent me home with a cream, it’s basically gone by now.

But I’m still convinced I have HIV. I know the best solution is to get tested, but I work so much that I won’t be able to make that happen until next week.

I’ve had allergies and eczema my entire life, so while the seasons are changing here, they’ve been going crazy. Now I have a swollen lymph node in my neck.

I’ve never had any of the symptoms of HIV (flu like symptoms lasting weeks, a rash, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, etc.) But something in my brain is just TELLING me I have it. 

I’m a gay man and for the last few years I’ve been really safe with sex. My main fear is two people I slept with back in 2013. One of those guys was tested in 2017 (when I was seeing him again) and he came back clean. Ive slept with a total of one other person in the last two years because we were dating for the majority of it and he was clean as well. But I am still convincing myself I have it. I’m not sure if this anxiety could cause my lymph node in my neck to swell (because it’s swollen) But this is only fueling my anxiety.

I’m freaking out and more depressed than I’ve been in years. Would I have seen genuine symptoms by now if I had contracted it?",3.349105263157896,3.6986472789473694,4.529052631578949,89.66436842105264,72.26315789473685,7.658947368421052,25.989473684210523,7.554174236665415,1.075966315789473,1386,41,320,15,25,457,176,380,0.117,0.7659999999999999,0.116,0.764,0,0,1,0,0,0,40.0,1,0,0,6,22,19,0,1,19,0,36,28,7,3,4,45,63,26,0,5,12,0,1,2,0,3,19,1,3,3,19,16,0,2,5,0,0,7,5,6,1,7,23,5,35,13,40,34,9,48,0,2,3,6,12,10,0,2,32,203,54,5,0.08117285579546568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07195483897282035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08795075534072612,0.0,0.05520032547674837,0.0,0.2483880500146184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12483383121069665,0.06777594399676215,0.14844665842112292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08518590419011306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09061575254293704,0.0,0.09284012233448807,0.0,0.16677376598830593,0.08587011829502474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06480992025728834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13982812350576768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830838574950677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052919128733104,0.05361390569346928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09134203016713614,0.04104343486160779,0.05798990439938417,0.0,0.0,0.0741905196267815,0.0,0.0,0.0890018466189729,0.0,0.0,0.04240946686705925,0.0,0.09226480915551806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08037388921571942,0.07178088830245727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08142299279296689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07215016389844339,0.0,0.08452903809538635,0.0446104786916139,0.3308335573502349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057334788614879076,0.0793139142846879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0541835115610286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05967138887816096,0.0,0.0626055105372906,0.0,0.08632825302444891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000965571405473,0.06173561462142298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056275037592865514,0.0708770066975956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05200140997233972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0646842565839181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06249083013827494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12964949498702266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1530089118918748,0.25310903310860017,0.0,0.0,0.1418973076073665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0520122883774724,0.07975191868194523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07694237600119902,0.07756414229888127,0.0,0.05511104075892677,0.0,0.3964704261745531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255598432396993,0.0,0.0729841458282055,0.07524805055843918,0.07324587672535167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818961156629115,0.2473049258534451,0.0,0.05766286779408965,0.0,0.0,0.15681797332698805

I've seen a lot of posts worrying about those things, but I also suffer from a real fear of throwing up. I'm paranoid about food poisoning and it's ruined my enjoyment of a lot of foods. I overcook a lot of my food and throw a lot of stuff out. Right now I'm sat here worrying that the chicken I had earlier from a take out wasn't cooked properly.

healthanxiety,rainbowmcflurry,2019/03/17,"I think meet all the requirements for colon cancer.... I’ve noticed bright blood in my BM’s for a few years but my GI doctor said it was hemmorhoids. It’s usually blood that I see on the surface but sometimes it’s kind of faded. I drink enough water and eat plenty of fiber, but I still find that I strain when I have a bowel movement, even when I use a squatty potty at home. I thought it was hemmorhoids that just wouldn’t go away but now I’m getting more concerned. I’m going to the GI tuesday to assess but I’m still very scared.

I’m 25 years old with no known history of colon cancer on any side of my family. I know my risk is low but I’ve had this for at LEAST five years and there’s a chance I may have let it go on for too long.

I’ve been having headaches all around my head, pain ranging from mild-moderate.

Sometimes it’s in the side of my head, sort of like pressure? I can’t explain it. Also I have wisdom teeth coming in, and sometimes it goes up to my head. 

Right now it’s on the left side. Very very mild.

healthanxiety,bergamottime,2019/03/17,"UTI...or not So I woke up on Friday having very mild symptoms of a uti, just a tiny bit of burning after peeing. I immediately drank a ton of water to flush. Afterwards the burning was barely noticeable but I know it was still there. Saturday morning I wake up and it’s still barely noticeable but still there so I make a doctors appointment. Unfortunately, my regular doctor isn’t in that day and neither is my usual back up so I book with the only doctor that’s in. At this clinic for as long as I could remember (I’ve gone here for over 10 years) they usually give you the results of the urine sample before you leave, keep this in mind that was the only reason I went because I convinced myself the only thing this could be is a uti or perhaps something worse even though I know I don’t have any of the symptoms but you never no right? It’s better to be safe. Anyways, she comes in and I explain my problem. At first she mentions it could just be irritation and she mentions something in particular that I do to dry my nether regions and I thought wow I could of actually cut myself or overwashed and a wave of relief washed over me. Because I do tend to overwash and use scented products. But then she said she would prescribe me a medication if I have a uti. She left and the nurse came in a few minutes later. The whole thing took 5 mins. 

The nurse comes back in saying I won’t have the result for three days and I’m confused so I call in the doctor. And she said there’s no harm in taking it even if you don’t have it. This goes against what my usual doctor says, she never suggests taking anything unnecessarily. 
Especially when it comes to a urine culture. Because of resistant bacteria or something. 
Anyways i left and picked up the medicine but it occurred to me she didn’t ask many questions...so that left me thinking it could be something else. Like a cut or a yeast infection or just being incredibly over washed. She didn’t even ask if I was sexually active or not or if I was having any other symptoms or if my period is due. 
But I was also in shock by how impersonal that visit felt as it’s not what I’m used to. 
So I have the medication but you know, me being anxious I don’t want to take it unless I have the results of the culture. At some moments it feels like I’m just irritated down there given what happened during the week leading up to these events. I quit using the regular soap I was using down there but I stilll used it for the rest of my body and if some slips down there it does burn. 

But sometimes I think omg did I just had a tiny muscle pain in my back is it an infection. Or regular body sensations freak me out. I’m really trying to relax but my mind keeps racing to all sorts of things :/ ",2.408229590017825,4.483282861818182,4.063155080213903,85.13983065953656,77.65454545454546,6.4955436720142625,24.602495543672013,7.5105763829236425,1.2371008912655967,2154,76,427,30,51,720,239,550,0.097,0.8290000000000001,0.07400000000000001,-0.9151,0,0,4,0,0,1,43.0,0,5,1,4,32,16,2,1,33,0,42,24,6,13,3,95,84,51,0,14,34,0,2,2,0,2,16,4,0,0,33,18,2,3,11,2,0,9,15,8,0,2,22,8,64,8,61,49,9,68,0,0,0,0,31,31,0,19,30,320,97,7,0.0,0.0,0.06620216715132123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05425171624680369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09226721041905588,0.0,0.0,0.07664002114678037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05582663510682016,0.0,0.1268427014152754,0.0,0.0,0.15649458502630464,0.0,0.12406411511393035,0.0,0.057726942046379785,0.0,0.0,0.05999906962411811,0.07406383622448329,0.1507101508097585,0.0,0.0,0.06927234340490622,0.077591019878817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17531475885155945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2708240620854806,0.0,0.0,0.08750252508085375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34718616673525426,0.05936734266884116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056671711855633834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344232703869777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034302001011678226,0.04846499241795861,0.06513715010071937,0.0,0.0,0.057704768004486165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06507842091542883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059990790524046274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12059882431293208,0.0,0.0,0.11184946072648802,0.0,0.0,0.07183288749335884,0.2211254535601109,0.0,0.0,0.06628650787165014,0.0,0.0,0.06003636784671002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04528380421009128,0.06877922968605714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366835594343773,0.0,0.0,0.13699835621232415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10464495932310723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15447284339049835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15478639560804586,0.07218666649658981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0649138289941135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0721563139597153,0.0,0.0,0.043460115448291134,0.06975093799251658,0.0,0.0,0.07684962677579439,0.05793508838289335,0.12906297107242154,0.10789836627537278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2089065426274851,0.06709560938083943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16253161278547326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21153556808856214,0.1530219732523799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13520987586050634,0.08693841412442976,0.06665256951655145,0.053857474281132085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537286502586428,0.04605898561466775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2929603929334549,0.22414891014894986,0.05597520048299718,0.04001385808737437,0.0,0.054417248994021034,0.0,0.0,0.06288846718325765,0.0,0.07574106679200783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06913487393650132,0.04819167197088848,0.0,0.0,0.043686810471633405

healthanxiety,lesserlightsofheaven,2019/03/17,"Are my symptoms a result of anxiety or is my anxiety a result of symptoms of something that’s killing me? It’s safe to say I live my life with nearly constant anxiety, particularly when it comes to my health. I’m hyper aware of sensations and little pains that come and go in my body at any given time. My life is kind of miserable as a result. In the quiet moments during a conversation I can almost guarantee you that’s what I’m thinking about. Whether or not the pain I just felt in my head or torso is a symptom of anxiety or do I have some sort of cancer that’s eating me alive?Am I alone in this or am I just a crazy person?

healthanxiety,b-ett03,2019/03/17,"First time health anxiety. Around late October I noticed whenever I smoked weed it was hard to swallow. Normal people get hungry and eat. I didn't eat, I had anxiety until I felt normal again. I guess the dry mouth you get made it worse for me to swallow? Anyway, fast forward to late November. I quit smoking weed. I'm due for a dental surgery and days before the surgery it feels as if I'm gonna choke on whatever is in my throat. At this point I couldn't even check my throat or put my tongue down long enough to look without gagging so much. I go through with the surgery, the surgeon says that one of my tonsils is larger than the other, and for me to get it checked out when I can. I go to my local hospital and they agree that my throat is swollen with a white spot (possibly a tonsil stone) along with swollen lymph nodes. He refers me to diagnostics for an ultrasound. This takes a month to do, because I live in a rural area and paperwork and such. Anyway, February 25th was my ultrasound and the results were sent back to my local doctor. He recommends a biopsy and CT scan this month. I may miss my daughters first birthday, and anxiety is through the roof. I had a family member give me a clonazepam once. It was the first time I felt normal in a long time. I really should get a prescription, but I dont wanna be dependent on meds. Basically raw dogging reality at this point. Dont smoke weed, dont drink. No support system in place. Basically suffering in silence while I try to maintain composure. I'm newish to reddit so apologies if this isn't posted right.

healthanxiety,str3ga,2019/03/17,"Have completely convinced myself I have lung cancer Here are the facts:
I’m 27F, very fit, never smoked, had the radon tested in my house last fall, it wasn’t optimal but was well within safe range, never been exposed to asbestos that i know of, no family history of cancer. About a month ago I started having upper respiratory symptoms, first shortness of breath and chest tightness that led to a cough. then i started having heart palpitations so i went to my PCP. she did an EKG which was normal and listened to my lungs and said they sounded clear. My cough cleared up after a couple days and I started getting back to normal but my anxiety was still nagging at me.

About a week after my doctor’s visit, I woke up from a nap totally unable to breathe and my blood pressure was very high so I went to the urgent care. they ran the full gambit of tests on me which all came back fine - EKG, blood work, chest x-ray, all normal. The doc said my lungs sounded clear. Figured it was a panic attack.

I felt okay for a day or two but my heart palpitations persisted and I still felt short of breath. I emailed my doctor and she ordered a bunch more blood tests which have all come back normal except for my blood calcium which was .2 above range. This is freaking me out because I read that high blood calcium can be caused by cancer. I’m doing a 24 hour urine test on Monday and then will have another appointment to talk about the results. I want to ask my doc for a chest CT but I feel so stupid asking for something like that just because I’ve been feeling vaguely out of breath.

I need someone to look at my situation logically and tell me I’m being ridiculous. This anxiety spiral has totally ruined my life for the past month.",5.3765686538980315,6.170934011869434,5.7205894254113865,81.33214931211225,67.93175074183976,8.263771243593201,28.968033450229296,8.296473431620573,1.96726824925816,1370,46,260,18,22,438,184,337,0.147,0.746,0.107,-0.9749,0,0,2,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,2,3,14,15,4,2,18,1,25,27,18,3,11,49,52,19,0,6,7,0,5,1,0,1,9,7,0,0,12,13,0,2,7,2,0,8,4,8,1,2,20,13,38,7,39,29,8,51,0,1,1,0,13,17,0,1,26,172,50,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891585562819062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10546743787972017,0.1538876346130558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18805840496472506,0.11442485405346155,0.0,0.2320206185873553,0.0,0.12262589459943515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115037312160551,0.10254853655987016,0.10332389324664076,0.0,0.08664120612521435,0.10545675447887533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11129042479760312,0.0,0.12973222040751567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2058968344683524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09481835642022593,0.0,0.10171305917295356,0.0,0.19314613162935956,0.0,0.0,0.08555373315690279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05254916684589631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383767848660075,0.0,0.21253766892457693,0.0,0.0,0.09905154511271627,0.1160564080489277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05527641965388082,0.08198654257039198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710429910010891,0.049138558237624363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08446229924887186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16056481210416376,0.0,0.0,0.0745791760959518,0.15514778476274346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3941901907326527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11800956097256328,0.0,0.0,0.09601548078354606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10060773172772887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1913502015415536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130567110090626,0.0,0.0,0.08522154244877862,0.07743179299019759,0.0,0.0,0.2135742148104273,0.0,0.16064745555316326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10454166481838334,0.0,0.08084280659801496,0.08791180181322601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825254648835388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16597891408745194,0.059324992643922624,0.0,0.08067962077596899,0.0,0.09043396061200104,0.18647828684190454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0732238115267703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Godkiller125,2019/03/18,"Solvent exposure I was working on a project involving supergluing wood together, and to assist the drying of the superglue I used a glue accelerator, which I believe with alot of exposure can cause brain damage. I think I used a decent bit too much and I got high off of it. I feel light headed, I’m out of focus, my head feels heavy and fuzzy. Did I give myself brain damage? I am super paranoid about permanently injuring my intellectual capacity, and I probably won’t ever use accelerator again, but have I already reduced my memory and processing power? Is it a practically non-existent or have I actually permanently hurt myself albeit slightly?",6.9768589743589775,8.509825777777777,8.973579059829062,56.77524038461542,64.72649572649573,12.345726495726495,36.84722222222222,11.93303328291395,5.414829914529913,524,26,78,19,8,187,83,117,0.101,0.856,0.043,-0.7383,1,0,0,0,0,2,13.0,0,0,0,3,4,4,0,0,7,0,8,5,4,4,1,18,17,7,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,7,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,3,3,17,1,10,13,3,6,0,3,0,0,2,4,0,2,2,56,20,2,0.0,0.0,0.17845047927998497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20179677343469685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20602694787707015,0.0,0.0,0.19964190962757009,0.0,0.0,0.4082770478061611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18785337791284595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16541243444879408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849247172469443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17542137822464174,0.0,0.0,0.14625435193199754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753457927183387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1932075814540696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19576144241535395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344272811624289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19716008141189356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11717291393863902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4738115815109031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13312835886006058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,tiredHApartner,2019/03/18,"How to be a supportive partner to someone with health anxiety? Hello. New to posting in forums like this, but I am struggling and could use advice/perspective. I hope I am allowed to make posts like this, but feel free to remove if it is violating any community rules.

&amp;#x200B;

I found this subreddit when researching health anxiety. My long term partner has been afflicted by this for the last 3 months. I know that is not a very long time, but it's been very hard. It feels like he suddenly starting having heart problems and ended up in the ER because he called an ambulance. They said it was panic/anxiety, and things have gotten worse since. We have done all the medical tests, and physically the doctors say he is fine and that his symptoms are anxiety. He is convinced otherwise, but I see his behaviors mirrored in all of the posts here. I believe he has health anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really trying to be as helpful as I can, but I feel so helpless. I am trying to reassure him that he is okay, but every other day he spirals into believing that he has cancer/kidney disease/muscular disorders/liver cirrhosis, etc etc. He even at one point thought he had an STD, which was hurtful to me as his long-term partner because I have not been unfaithful and I viewed it as an attack on my character. I realize now that it is US against THE ANXIETY but sometime's it's still hard. Before all of this, we used to go and do things all the time. Now it feels like we don't go out and any time I can get him out, it's a chore because he feels so sick (or anxious).

&amp;#x200B;

He has started therapy, but insists it will not help because he thinks he has a true medical problem and not health anxiety. I want to be as supportive as I can be, but I'm really struggling with how to support without enabling or indulging in his fears. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm hopeful that this community can help give me some advice on how to help a partner experiencing health anxiety? What is helpful for you to hear from your partners? How can I be the most supportive partner I can be without losing myself (which is how I am starting to feel lately)? Should I push or encourage him to go out even when he says he is sick? I miss our old life, but I don't want to force him into an activity if he really is ill. Alternatively, is there anything I can do to be more empathetic? What do you wish your partner knew about your health anxiety?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your advice. I just want to understand and be helpful.",4.877977637335928,6.077499000000002,5.9063928050559085,78.0713004375304,69.33057851239671,9.330481283422461,33.03694701020904,9.627879704456738,3.2165254739912488,1972,91,368,44,34,654,214,484,0.173,0.6859999999999999,0.142,-0.9349,1,0,0,0,0,0,75.0,5,7,1,2,20,29,2,3,17,1,55,16,1,9,5,81,97,41,0,12,22,0,8,4,7,2,15,4,1,7,29,20,0,0,13,0,1,5,8,11,1,1,12,15,50,19,50,74,10,44,0,4,2,1,60,14,0,9,26,258,79,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097427594397344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2798988988178876,0.3138974893123063,0.07026891471471604,0.0,0.3557171696158173,0.058367550999297364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04251648059276896,0.0,0.0,0.05877720862143788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259797593605654,0.0,0.043963717435209784,0.11641913491478816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05275647078414932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041250868721283564,0.0,0.0,0.03332011146919278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05288204776029557,0.0,0.0528719635922617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04576048759587725,0.0,0.1152418571234918,0.0682494339328512,0.0,0.043530592548045366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058138292412670024,0.15674242492125307,0.07381999311346994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05664878889305824,0.0,0.0,0.026993203252336204,0.049562460903556316,0.08808844807150981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09256466350789123,0.0,0.0,0.3295094292612679,0.05823101486726456,0.061224120102572575,0.2077826350208974,0.0,0.0,0.10263142375668774,0.0,0.0,0.055309215640239766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028394125356055136,0.042114452814235814,0.05828117603185255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03649302188500912,0.10096503291286996,0.0,0.0,0.13716759375865464,0.0,0.057800718625953665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03448726542771492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10409554312064093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041239080164782185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04989906873591228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05421447595745712,0.0,0.03501002506960918,0.0,0.0,0.06061858362841242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048840799765502894,0.0,0.1484444174792905,0.0,0.0,0.09887422178856632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09929513850232208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04914592554563034,0.08217329930347042,0.0,0.0,0.04117088504482399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04273841269537048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043776191990703706,0.0,0.05109871244509173,0.0,0.1097077753248182,0.0,0.04126030610945663,0.0,0.0,0.10802444464833684,0.0,0.0,0.2345185608878982,0.0,0.05370045951547939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04756684813928473,0.05908424691367872,0.0,0.06864880956284639,0.033105303497289434,0.0,0.04101680596847514,0.09038008032599568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015525704752393,0.0,0.0,0.05378583058452666,0.062147492766078526,0.08924517722963057,0.0,0.08525925019331712,0.09142133056515674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05941302156367177,0.09960780961115093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052651776708026836,0.0,0.0,0.3138974893123063,0.0
healthanxiety,CatarinaPi,2019/03/18,"Weird feeling on lower leg, of course I'm convinced it's bone cancer I'm 24 years-old, female, and I've been struggling with HA for around a year now. Mostly I have a hard time with cancer, which brings me here today because I'm freaking out.

Since Wednesday last week I have this weird feeling below my left knee, in the front of the leg. It generally doesn't hurt when I'm resting or when I'm active, it's just like the skin is hyper sensitive there and when my jeans move against the skin, it hurts. It doesn't even affect my day to day but my anxiety is so over the top that I'm ALWAYS hyper aware of that area of the leg. First my mind jumped to ""maybe it's a cloth"", then it went to ""maybe it's bone pain"", but since I don't know what that feels like, what do I know really?  


Honestly, I'm just looking to see if someone ever feels weird pains and skin sensations in random places of the body (had something similar awhile ago in my right arm that went away) due to anxiety, since it's not a symptom that I see around much.",6.036805437553098,4.823961542056075,6.168300764655907,85.48957094307563,66.75700934579439,9.27714528462192,28.80033984706882,8.00094639256281,1.5628467289719628,806,20,180,8,11,257,121,214,0.126,0.7709999999999999,0.104,-0.4138,1,0,1,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,2,13,14,0,1,11,1,10,16,11,1,1,27,29,12,0,1,7,0,8,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,18,8,0,0,6,0,0,6,4,9,0,1,4,11,12,5,24,25,3,38,0,2,3,0,0,15,0,4,19,99,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11413155160055564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10713260894683688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19699101514154668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22923450384171806,0.0,0.0,0.12096745456087153,0.0,0.0,0.07848648632660714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14301528906987113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16606975510997435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08503998246001035,0.11646424097861205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2604050524269015,0.0919809961463414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10951703030658873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11533718168084126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27566498104881354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14151829740431018,0.10495068229164224,0.0,0.0,0.13989024845236436,0.0,0.0,0.1258041881553542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10811988963285274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25869890221144914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13000358244306182,0.0,0.0,0.13684380583444153,0.09464809172037968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351043611302873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2740040248259563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13451922863610824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08248231377185877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10995415196454746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20519855713497304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3195168361008401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090917941595876,0.0991201635123127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13460033803628574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13382341426549862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07507676867785669,0.0,0.12204256005864005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10327769633899343,0.0,0.0,0.2387101934421881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08291255492177206
healthanxiety,Charger1897,2019/03/18,"Anxiety Symptoms I'm new to this Reddit thing but I have been reading posts in this subreddit for a couple of weeks now and I thought I would post about my anxiety symptoms. I am recently struggling with the thought that this really is anxiety, my biggest fear is of course the big C-word, lymphoma for example. Everything started in November about 4 months ago, on vacation in Vietnam. I experienced what I think was my first panic attack with heart palpitations, pressure on chest, difficulty to breath etc. Since then, I have experienced so many different symptoms and sensations such as lump in throat, feeling of not getting enough air, difficulty to breath, waking up several times every night (sometimes with a strange feeling of fear), lately my skin feels like its burning or is sensitive, it also sometimes feels like my heart flutters, skips a beat or is just pounding out of my chest but not a fast heartbeat just very hard and powerful. I also experience headaches like never before, extremely cold feet pretty much all the time. Man, I've probably missed a few sensations too but this is really getting to me. I've had EKG, echo, blood work done to test my thyroid etc and all came back clear. I'm thinking about how I feel all the time and I am noticing every little sensation in my body and the smallest thing can set me off into almost panic for a few seconds. Lately its been more of pressure on my chest and difficult to breath thats been the worst symptom. On top of this, I had a cold for about three weeks ago and I felt a lymph node that was swollen, this set my health anxiety off into a frenzy and I can't stop thinking about it ever since. I can still feel the lymph node ( I'm touching it all the freaking time hoping its gone, knowing that I shouldn't) and my doctor said it was nothing to worry about, but as you know, health anxiety finds its way back no matter what. Sorry for all this rambling but this is really affecting my life. Do you guys have similar or the same symptoms? How do you cope or how did you overcome this son of a b\*tch anxiety?",7.296982002768807,7.2305497918781745,7.1777941855099225,75.49940470696815,63.771573604060926,10.513890170742963,35.67558837101984,10.125756701596842,3.5545522842639588,1654,70,300,33,22,527,201,394,0.166,0.746,0.08800000000000001,-0.9858,2,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,0,4,0,5,21,16,1,7,19,0,28,28,14,4,8,64,53,28,0,3,13,1,10,3,0,2,14,1,0,2,25,17,0,1,15,1,0,2,6,12,0,3,16,15,33,4,46,35,14,52,0,1,0,0,8,20,0,6,28,207,58,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13341658934562795,0.0,0.0753561961131636,0.0,0.0,0.12036148955931256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3454154745556376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08561249980268132,0.0,0.11573164663303633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06403576894045022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083590435004164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08607074001636641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832673246546027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07862460658051247,0.0,0.07702584742672547,0.0,0.0770111592362847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775769010576193,0.16785661826490822,0.0,0.0680717189689818,0.1268097935692328,0.0,0.06763360931159265,0.07361303334963626,0.0,0.16936376069728976,0.2283046632763741,0.1075232100007521,0.0722558193007674,0.0,0.06878096200120706,0.06401117155536727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863441161346653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07451347487314322,0.0,0.0,0.06741296858230028,0.0,0.0,0.15998335981611994,0.0,0.17835314378264214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747443860656017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827154643256045,0.0,0.16977999767437574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0531542565937722,0.11029618107593456,0.07542446363417858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07629593226226881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06006717272351824,0.0,0.055320485038178296,0.0,0.05804066696113471,0.07268096108172692,0.0,0.07062095502676062,0.0,0.07220842039255496,0.08567738872241759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17658914401162734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14414541463973327,0.07656056079750895,0.08113673980130358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07527455013107648,0.0,0.14462927425132466,0.0,0.07430442923123008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07158396323610475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08501580911393908,0.0,0.1245020794374637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14885662697248606,0.08424089926982567,0.053265299672198216,0.0,0.06009808957423082,0.06291586855325744,0.0,0.07867201388981387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3910895640930495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09999107363206587,0.14465952988939654,0.0,0.11948683427616615,0.17552528245908022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06209258411167432,0.0,0.059733269481095926,0.12072873633792665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05478594315670487,0.07642427807670485,0.0,0.053458414074703565,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Cruzin180,2019/03/18,"Can I Wait? DT2 I need to know from a nurse or doctor - someone in the medical field please - 

I had gestational diabetes last summer and experienced symptoms with it - dizziness, fatigue, nausea, thirst, frequent urination, headache. I had the baby in September and everything went back to normal. About 2 weeks ago, all these symptoms returned but worse. I went back to the diabetic diet and started walking, most symptoms are gone with doing this- but if I vary at all, I get SO SICK - and gain 3-5 lbs overnight. I still have headache and bloating even on the diet... I know I probably have diabetes- it runs in my family. But I don’t have insurance and my husband is unemployed until June. How bad is it if I wait until then to get this checked?

healthanxiety,protokitty,2019/03/18,"Heart anxiety is back thanks to weird arm pains My anxiety is back. 

This time, this weird arm pain that extends from my elbow to my hand is triggering it.  Logically, I know that it's likely due to the fact that I tend to lean on my left arm, but my brain keeps telling me ""well, what if it isn't?"" 

The pain usually happens when I'm resting my arm on my leg or have it bent to some capacity (it happened about 5 or so times during an hour video game session), but I've been lying in bed and it hasn't happened since. It doesn't seem to get worse with exertion either, as I run and do other cardio and weights at least 4 times a week. It just comes and goes seemingly at random.

I want to believe it's nothing wrong and it's a nerve thing at worse. My mind won't let me. To it, any arm pain like this is impending doom. I just wish I could shake this feeling.",2.8362345941351492,3.6769102265193396,4.052154696132597,90.80915427114323,73.80662983425414,7.558181045473863,24.97280067998301,7.882392219407189,1.0479660858478534,665,20,155,9,13,218,111,181,0.187,0.7170000000000001,0.096,-0.9586,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,0,8,13,0,1,5,0,13,16,10,1,1,29,28,13,0,4,8,0,3,2,0,1,5,0,1,0,21,7,1,1,5,2,0,3,4,9,1,0,1,3,16,4,18,24,4,21,1,1,0,0,2,8,0,7,12,94,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08526248167886279,0.0,0.19183022365095095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19281846899594127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14125996392630202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13996518814482267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10800349222456593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10010547203880564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339573331681689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06550570781119927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326185101766511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14857552417717554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12347372873539884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11144322020545357,0.0,0.0,0.06890539302582903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13622538889868607,0.12820921727222714,0.0,0.12250835670209255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12659773481322434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12030518422377058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336512766925502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22828190301638385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371536672273557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10958736643001513,0.1154327638177584,0.0,0.0,0.08329668803611298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21932969860755575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380880037311342,0.0,0.07395218358895482,0.0,0.10057201630555827,0.15267867244674854,0.11273138958475908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14418044403061092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25554521029126176,0.0,0.13708299736903998,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,shelbycoop,2019/03/19,"I just want to feel normal again,how can one do such a thing? Just a college student who wants to feel somewhat sane again. It’s been almost three months since my blood clot and although I’ve adapted to things I still don’t feel like myself. Prior to today I was living in fear, constantly thinking about how things affect me and the worst possible outcome. These thoughts took over everything in my life, even before this clot I was and an over thinker. I’ve never been on medication for anxiety and just got on it, so hopefully that will help some current thoughts of fear fade. “Will I wake up tomorrow?”

Throughout these months I have been to numerous doctors appointments and check ups, my body just wants to have multiple issues this year I guess. One problem after the next and the moment when my fear starts to subside another issue arises, school. I started to feel better, healthy in a way, yet because I was so determined to feel humane again I fell behind. Some professors were understanding, others focused more on the needed work rather than my health. Little do they all know that if my grades fall, I lose my scholarship. Three years down the drain right there. “How do I explain to professional people that I was afraid to live? Or that my meds persistently make me tired?”

I know in my heart, mind and soul that there are people out there who have it SO much worse. Believe me when I say I “overthink”, I do. You could make eye contact with me and I’d think something is automatically wrong with me. I don’t have time for counseling because I fear it would interfere with school. I’m not one to vent, no one ever has their full attention so I keep everything in. But goodness, I’m so tired of living in fear. The idea of being told how super rare my case was and that I’m lucky to even be here lives in the back of my head. 

If anyone has advice with life after a blood clot, anxiety, college or anything I could really use it. 
I know my post was extremely jumbled and vague, for that I am sorry. It’s an accurate description of my jumbled mind.",5.028549783549785,6.309583095959599,5.212077922077924,82.88454545454549,69.05050505050505,8.384415584415583,28.284271284271284,8.738905477910976,2.058524098124098,1630,56,313,27,28,513,213,396,0.117,0.807,0.076,-0.9432,1,0,1,0,0,0,42.0,0,1,2,5,29,16,0,6,13,0,33,14,7,7,3,73,65,26,0,13,11,0,5,1,0,3,7,1,0,1,23,15,0,2,17,0,2,3,5,10,0,6,15,7,45,6,46,43,8,50,1,1,1,0,11,19,0,11,27,221,68,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710278512948054,0.0,0.0,0.07900963595589547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273633900771886,0.12072066755771592,0.0,0.0,0.055170588018800135,0.0,0.0649301822065038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060671290090870376,0.0,0.09619668203445113,0.0,0.06714036871689974,0.08889630017525922,0.0,0.06978300797568159,0.0,0.08764308948339074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08526576574664442,0.0,0.12599473827121271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08076023576403472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10422895119650273,0.07137199078566234,0.0,0.0,0.14182528115053653,0.0,0.0,0.4439372529074864,0.1994778273376404,0.05636808993258556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06617982397282468,0.06310568061728715,0.0,0.08692019693157509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08097691249330892,0.08386985855211325,0.0,0.09350005499676783,0.052886802808214665,0.0,0.0,0.07836816396519901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08907152098134066,0.0,0.16470779547873038,0.0,0.07013232681448316,0.0,0.0,0.1300885473533194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114625917867044,0.038547863629105665,0.07908121324165583,0.2786900459156093,0.0,0.0,0.08827191573068084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10533630238465384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764308948339074,0.0794861485178729,0.0,0.0,0.15933842714749266,0.0,0.1259587318515414,0.0,0.058002548021482574,0.05850533700674555,0.060854610553193224,0.0,0.08391389467882644,0.0,0.07730787319202828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21386599032946374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10940236625145956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08895091568394876,0.07556695615509885,0.0,0.0,0.07549920815117697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050547076845555636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06738245709513678,0.0,0.06274657758468552,0.0,0.1597074479421748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06526911176178407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06074313744227551,0.0,0.08832508973662898,0.11169544518574503,0.0,0.06301178169574981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15725830258160964,0.10111530202460807,0.0,0.12527982786584907,0.0460087868797198,0.18137404584651887,0.07479051422799825,0.07539489147172374,0.08766378002527514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214047191327079,0.0,0.06814658148771112,0.0,0.0,0.13961653383338166,0.06262927429443806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05744209033337192,0.0,0.0804085711583986,0.05605019962099739,0.08626769357947878,0.0,0.10162147722199427

healthanxiety,CupricFlipper,2019/03/19,"Thyroid cancer? Lymphoma? Random infection? I'm a 21 year old male.

 20 days ago I started feeling pain in the lower right part of my throat right above my collarbone. Halfway through the week I noticed a lump was there and made an appointment with my doctor. Doctor sent me for an ultrasound and found a 3cm lump in my neck but couldn't make out what exactly it was, so I was sent for a CT scan. The CT scan results showed that this tumor was near a muscle and lymph node. It looked suspicious to her and she also saw 2 other minor swollen lymph nodes so she referred me to a much better hospital (Vanderbilt) so that they could do their own tests. 

That was 12 days ago. This past Friday I had a fine needle biopsy done on the lump and got the results back yesterday. Apparently cancer wasn't detected and bacteria wasn't either but I did see something about 2+ polys. The test was essentially inconclusive but whatever it was it looked ""infectious"" and ""something on the uncommon side"", according to my doctor. 

My doctor was going to prescribe me Augmentin but since I am allergic I was prescribed Clindamycin. He wants to try me on that for a week and see if it helps. However, the day after the biopsy was done I have started experiencing slight pain right under my adam's apple when I yawn or look down. Seems like there is a bump there too. I let my doctor know this yesterday but he still wants to go through with the antibiotic for a week to see if anything changes. 

I don't really notice any other symptoms. I think my mouth has been a bit more dry as of late but nothing crazy. I was pretty worried early on but started to get over it until this other lump showed up. Wouldn't the CT scan from just over a week ago detected this new lump? I feel like I should be relieved that they didn't find anything malignant but I'm also worried that maybe they missed it or didn't get a proper reading. I have all the trust in the world in this hospital but my nerves are getting the best of me. Sorry if this is kind of all over the place.

healthanxiety,healthquestion29,2019/03/19,"Hows do you differentiate between imagined problems and real problems? (Long rant) Since I was probably 19/20 I have had a roller coaster of health anxiety. It all started with an actual kidney issue which later resolved itself and the only possible cause was ""stress"". Since then I have had a huge fear of STI's which led to my ultimate fear of cancer and warts caused by HPV (especially throat/mouth). I have always had some form of anxiety, when I was younger I'd pull out my eyelashes and scour my face for blemishes. I believe this has led to me being so hard on my self that I notice any imperfection. I have tonsil stones and while I stuck my finger down my throat I went past my tonsils this time ( gross I know) and I felt a bump, almost like a skin tag. This led to me feeling so panicked  I became physically ill  and left work early. Since then I've been googling and come to the conclusion that I can't keep doing this to myself. Normal people do not stick their fingers down their throat to find god knows what. Of course It's going to feel weird down there.

I understand this new thought will not pass immediately but how do you guys differentiate real vs imagined issues? How do you calm yourself down? I am at my wit's end, my gf is too. I'm sick of being withdrawn and lying to her about what's wrong. I'm sick of going down rabbits holes for hours on end. I'm sick of physically checking my self countless times. I'm just sick of it. Sometimes the only times I find any relief is when I am in actual distress from a confirmed ailment and that's just sad.",3.4323126550868466,5.31295523870968,4.476129032258065,84.20727047146403,74.03225806451613,7.091811414392061,25.148883374689827,7.882392219407189,1.3942158808933005,1244,41,243,18,26,405,177,310,0.187,0.767,0.045,-0.9924,2,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,3,2,3,12,14,0,4,9,0,25,15,7,8,1,49,43,21,0,3,6,0,7,1,1,1,8,0,0,3,16,13,0,1,13,1,1,9,3,10,0,0,11,7,37,4,34,29,3,38,0,1,0,0,10,12,0,2,18,151,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.21555228862897965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11059241131792484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189717434767927,0.0,0.0,0.1502096474106302,0.0,0.16897672745347192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12443110355693775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2269101528848634,0.0,0.0951366073724701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1956389033478476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2485574863314173,0.11168629579331307,0.0,0.10604231238296573,0.0,0.2018852551701792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12553426390119027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093556374518087,0.0,0.0,0.09893496665384036,0.0,0.0,0.11739542629141025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876381318383548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305469711950142,0.0,0.0981665469016974,0.0,0.0,0.12139283993731773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11999631744193287,0.0,0.0,0.05395672487691328,0.0,0.0,0.09773831467442652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10666624853066754,0.0,0.0,0.10821039746265043,0.0,0.12573974673570545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16799330121465694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10543005465299976,0.07656706261999223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245075506982042,0.0,0.0,0.11907591099245708,0.2113574978802205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514159447206933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304316469386062,0.0,0.0,0.27407802986249136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10923065498700477,0.0,0.07817191198815365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12651174048425298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876791677720987,0.1932000807729724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497474638095792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10238149001024907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804036014626852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12075175561011467,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,alanasofly,2019/03/19,"2 things Hello! I’ve been suffering with anxiety most of my life but got diagnosed officially in college. Anyway I am on Zoloft and am doing well. However there are two things that have been driving me crazy and I was wondering if anyone else gets this. 

1) ever since I was little I would try to fall asleep but I would have the urge to urinate. It would frustrate me SO much because it literally made my skin crawl. I would get up and only go a tiny bit. This would happen about 4-5 times and I finally would calm my body down and fall asleep. Well I’m an adult now and this still happens from time to time. It’s so annoying and I’m not sure why it happens? It’s such an urge to go and I can’t shake it off until I literally go to the bathroom. 

2) I’m on birth control and I have bad ice pick needle headaches. I’ve kept a headache log and it seems to happen soon before my period. However I am convinced that I have a brain tumor or some type of brain thing that’s causing me these HORRIBLE headache pains. It’s always the left aide of my head and the pain feels like someone is putting an ice pick in my head real quick then over and over again. (It  happens minutes from each other and then some time will go by but it will randomly happen again) my doctor said I could get an MRI but I don’t want to because a) I’m scared if they do find something and b) I am just crazy and nothings wrong with me. Ps. I have a nose ring that I refuse to take out because I did once during surgery and it closed up. 

I’m a 26 year old healthy female.. on birth control, Zoloft and have hypothyroidism. (On meds as well) basically I’m just looking if anyone else has these feelings?!! 

Thanks so much. This community has helped a lot. Even though we all deal with this everyday and it’s a pain... it’s nice to know I’m not the only one who has to suffer through this. :) ",1.1183593750000007,3.273813700520833,2.5659791666666685,93.76443750000004,82.56770833333334,5.715,21.31875,6.961326702584282,0.415041875,1447,45,322,18,40,469,198,384,0.152,0.7709999999999999,0.078,-0.9863,2,0,1,0,0,0,42.0,1,0,1,2,21,20,2,2,17,0,33,19,10,6,3,68,66,34,0,11,12,0,3,1,0,8,9,2,0,1,30,25,0,4,6,0,0,9,4,11,3,2,9,7,31,9,36,48,9,46,0,2,1,0,9,16,0,11,22,207,61,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06696661161669985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06156771935568964,0.0,0.0,0.11254832659721344,0.1649245226810479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06719824562919204,0.14718135118696302,0.0,0.06848337508775483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08786437141472349,0.08939621103733879,0.0,0.17968675132124354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08267612245963671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1805324955200746,0.06425750323544982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08297234291702046,0.0,0.08168648724374067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08237567984358975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13446304142548726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05315691957167278,0.07279964213994553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08138719004571365,0.05749561879992913,0.0,0.08816296530778918,0.07355814566708249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12614395035229048,0.0,0.18295675258641092,0.0,0.06436798126778731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.427014319168514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16519338149930987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0539446956149265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04423023462274636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874428059688331,0.0,0.05684608699252504,0.03931893515322898,0.08066307189432897,0.0,0.0,0.06758374250623042,0.0,0.0,0.06842203999096362,0.0,0.07615303678373526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939621103733879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832554178990876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07722365827817694,0.0,0.08445123635534722,0.08570960308277209,0.05453598600271105,0.12241880380442086,0.2569122691818031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809056006784661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09160495980354116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07655582943222082,0.0,0.08057548783704012,0.0,0.0,0.07326684956834123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06657468744734125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06819126204309398,0.061958180226962624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06427220408951334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07585235880489398,0.0,0.06051167109280079,0.0,0.0,0.07409606131841802,0.0,0.0,0.16040393472920011,0.0,0.07907214130790606,0.0,0.18771639592877806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054641293583099264,0.0,0.07861821027254401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0474697594392617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21708616372653494,0.0,0.07262155457031834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08727817546280195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3430282184395078,0.08799330313882947,0.0,0.05182710398054336
healthanxiety,Mozartmoonlight,2019/03/19,"Sleep disorder - heart starts pounding, thoughts races at 3am **like clockwork** every night I'm at my wit's end here. By all appearances I seem like a pretty mentally stable person. I've never experienced depression and am even-tempered, keeping cool and civil in most situations. But every single night, like clockwork, at 3am I get these raging panic attacks and can't sleep. Whether I go to bed exhausted at 10pm, or leisurely after bath/chamomile tea/meditation at 11 or midnight, almost like an internal alarm, I'm ALWAYS back up at 3am, my mind screaming panic and negative thoughts that I'll fail at everything, I'm a waste of space, nothing I do will ever work. This keeps happening despite my overall productive days when all the items on my to-do list at work and personal life are checked off. I've tried medication, meditation, nothing works.

healthanxiety,mybreadprofile,2019/03/19,"Painful pinching head pain... Very scared A few weeks ago I had a really bad panic attack about having a blood clot from a really bad leg pain..it turned out to be nothing but since then I started getting these short, pinching bursts of pain on the top right side of my head in the same spot. At first they only happened once or twice a day, but now some days they happen more frequently or hurt more/less.
 My neck and back muscles on the same side have been sore, and sometimes when I'm slouching or just getting out of bed is when the pain happens. I went to the doctor and she asked my family history of aneurysms, which was none. She scheduled me an MRI for next week but she said she really doesn't think it's anything....

healthanxiety,Somethingmango,2019/03/19,"Rabies bite? Hey guys. So everybody thinks I'm too imaginative, but I recently got a very small bite on my finger from my new three month old puppy. I've had him 10 days today, and he's great. Eating and drinking regularly, playful, already understanding commands but last night I was playing with him and his chew toy and he bit my finger instead of the toy (my fault not his, he's teething) I immediately washed it throroughly, also used peroxide, finally placing Neosporin and band aid. 

He's getting his last vaccine (rabies) in two days. Should I be concerned that I have it?? He has not been outside or had any contact with any other animal since I've had him which like I said was for 10 days.

healthanxiety,jillianjiggs92,2019/03/20,"On the Here and Now Looking out at a beautiful spring day I find myself buried in anxiety.  Thoughts crash into my mind

“*I’ve lost weight recently, what if it’s the beginning of the end”*

*“I feel dizzy, oh god there’s something wrong I know it”*

*“What if I stop looking and miss an important symptom?”*

&amp;#x200B;

I am so fucking tired of this.  We spend so much of our day worrying about the future or ruminating on our past.  But we have *only* now.  Our consious mind doesn’t inhabit the future or the past, it inhabits this very moment.  Right. Now.  

And right now I don’t want to feel anxious.  Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to feel anxious ever but I can only change that *right now*.  The best part?  The more I change that right now, the easier it will be to change that for future me.  

&amp;#x200B;

So starting right now I’m going to:

1. **STOP GOOGLING (and body checks).**  My doctor once told me I have “googleitis” and the best and only cure was to just stop.  Helpful advice there.    
Obviously go to your doctor if you're worried about something, and by all means, get a second opinion if you're still concerned.  Beyond that, leave it to the professionals to diagnose.  
2. **Stop seeking reassurance for every symptom.**  I know what people are going to say to me.  “You’re fine”, “Statistically that only has a 0.00001% chance”, “breathe deeply”.  I can do this for myself.  I can be kind and firm with my own mind.  
3. **Stop asking “what if”**.  Things can and will happen.  Worrying about the future will never help.  We can only live our best lives now, and take life as it comes.
4. **Actually acknowledge statistics.**  Next time I feel a symptom I’m going to ask myself “what’s the most likely cause?”  Pretty much any symptom can be better attributed to harmless things like lack of sleep, too much coffee, too much anxious thinking, and so on.
5. **Recognize and challenge maladaptive thought patterns.** The more I think in anxious ways, the more my brain will automatically go back to those patterns.  Time to see those thoughts for what they are: unrealistic beliefs and fears.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know anxiety is going to get worse at the start, but I can handle that.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can do this.  So can you.

healthanxiety,JTC02,2019/03/20,"There is always light at the other end of the tunnel! Just a little backstory; I have had hypochondria that has steadily i creased in terms of severity, since late last November. Over this period of time I have been worried about; going deaf, having heart disease/dying of a heart attack, going blind, having the Hantavirus, having lung cancer, and the most recent one - skin cancer. Throughout all of my fictional illnesses, even with the consideration of how rare they are to my specific case, I continued to believe I had them. I mean heck, I live in Australia and there are only 15 cases a year of the HantaVirus out of the whole country. Didn’t matter. My brain knew I would be in that 0.00000062% chance of getting it. Although of this considerably unrealistic thinking, I still believe that deep down I knew I did not have the virus. Enter, Skin Cancer. Out of all of my fears, this one really stood out to me. I had an ‘oh shit’ moment where I realised my petty fears before where nothing compared to this beast. Due to the fact I am a relatively avid golfer who plays without sunscreen and typically without a hat, this fear was so real to me. Book the doctors in, a 16 day wait I shit you not. In the beginning of this wait I was fine because my worries were on other things. However, approaching the date I developed absolute chaos inside of my head. I head to google and establish... “Yep... must be Stage 4 skin cancer, this is the end.” For the week I could not attend school, maintaining the fear there was a long road of chemotherapy, doctors appointments and eventually death, ahead of me. Today I finally go in to the get the skin check. I was essentially prepared to have my life torn to shreds if I needed to get a biopsy, and then to wait for the results of said biopsy. Doc looks at practically every mole on my body - nothing. No stage 4 cancer. No risk of death. Just, nothing. Although other worries have taken the limelight of the skin cancer, I maintain a sense of happiness and humour about how much I work myself up. How much I google every single one of my bloody symptoms. Not just I however - we all do. This story was to simply let people know that there always light at the other end of the tunnel and I cannot say it enough - stop googling your symptoms. If you are really worried about something, get it checked up with your doctor ASAP and put your concerns put to rest by the professional!

Hope someone had some advice for this.

I'm 28 and for the last 10 years plus I have had an issue in the winter months where I get really itchy when I start sweating.

I can be walking to work, playing football or just in a shop that is too hot and I become unbelievably itchy and have to stop to cool down.

There is no issue in the summer months.

Any ideas?",2.337414104882459,4.203800354430385,3.4494032549728786,90.43316455696205,77.10126582278481,6.033273056057867,21.4122965641953,6.868970318607317,0.4110853526220613,304,8,64,3,7,98,57,79,0.113,0.8009999999999999,0.086,-0.2928,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,1,6,3,0,0,5,1,8,2,2,0,1,11,12,7,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,2,5,3,10,9,2,16,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,3,10,43,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2441877575140489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16993247583823426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2759817718066914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13055621758488706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24819526541121414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2820932464407549,0.0,0.521636503214404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20369215219419956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3989165919037732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16008471448960868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2117293747299687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1768720821085611,0.0,0.0,0.20891763938561808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18192151167912055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609197423700832

I, 23F, have had bloody discharge for over 2 weeks now. And though I don't fit into the risk factors (never had sex, don't smoke) and dont have any other symptoms, this is really eating my head now.

Can anyone please share their experience or knowledge regarding this?

healthanxiety,jetlaggedjess,2019/03/20,"Am I Going Crazy? So, I’m a healthy 27 year old American woman (today is my birthday) and the last few months have been almost unbearable and I can’t seem to get a grip on anything. For reference, it all started last November when I started having pain in my upper left abdomen that wouldn’t seem to go away. I’m currently living in Spain, which is where I’m currently living and working. My doctor said that I had acid reflux and told me to what I ate. Pain persisted, lots of mucus coming out, constipation, tons of gas. Decided to take a probiotic and managed to get my symptoms to disappear for a month while on winter break. Then in January, the pain came back. My stools were hard and dark, and the pain was consistent. Had an ultrasound and was told that I had tons of gas in my colon so they couldn’t see clearly, but my other organs looked good. But then, my coworker suddenly began having blood in her stool too and many intestine issues. Turns out that she had worms. I decided to check my stool, found something that looked like a worm, went to the emergency room, tool mebendazol to get rid of the worms (This also made sense because I lived in Asia for 2 years before Spain and had just recently moved).
Just after my first dose of mebendazole, I started to have a weird feeling in my lungs. Felt like I couldn’t breathe in all the way, but that was it. Anyway, in addition to that, I began to have sinus pressure, a mild sore throat, and drainage. 
I took my second dose of the worm medicine, had a stool sample that came back clear of everything (no blood), and even a chest X-ray that was clear. I’ve been secretly worried that I have colon cancer since a friend of mine suddenly died at age 25 from it. She had no symptoms and went to the doctor with a persistent cough and ended up having stage 4. Since my lung issues flared up, I’ve been so worried that I have some cancer that has metastasized and went to my lungs. I haven’t been able to completely shake this cold yet and it’s been over 3 or 4 weeks. I still wake up and spit up yellowish colored spit. Lungs feel a bit off. To make matters worse, I’m still having stomach problems after being cleared of the worms and my doctor says that I probably have IBS. Then, last night, I began having heart palpitations and rushed to the emergency room. My EKG was normal and my blood test was normal. She said I have pvcs and need to relax. Honestly, I just feel like I’m shutting down and I haven’t felt healthy in a long time. I can’t seem to shake this chest cold, my digestive problems are still there, have some reflux too, and now pvcs. I feel like I’m a mess... just spent the morning of my 27th birthday in the emergency room getting the tests on my heart. Can anyone relate?",4.883833333333332,5.7134488277777775,5.228518518518519,84.29333333333336,69.05555555555556,8.666666666666668,27.592592592592588,8.841846274778883,1.9281481481481482,2157,68,434,36,36,685,253,540,0.13,0.785,0.085,-0.9757,2,0,1,0,0,0,70.0,0,0,1,4,22,19,0,3,28,0,46,39,21,2,6,73,95,36,1,8,8,0,8,4,1,1,17,3,3,1,23,30,2,0,14,1,2,14,9,11,0,2,38,19,50,8,61,53,9,91,0,0,4,0,13,32,0,8,46,273,73,7,0.07634460213500156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644809108327398,0.0,0.0,0.0610527507448157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05338192091320863,0.0,0.06282510257542827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07172826681645769,0.1174085731415272,0.0,0.046538960856518964,0.0,0.06496363337124272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08334853245282611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1746357728167374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06576411472624663,0.0800458628217097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923364375790999,0.0,0.0,0.2344258058488721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761865721316439,0.0,0.0,0.050424889687077486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06861360567057605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15440849895234726,0.10908119803923584,0.14660558096394474,0.0,0.0,0.06493867957537425,0.0,0.08370791569200252,0.058983650228528375,0.0,0.15954761443315038,0.0,0.08677679351073599,0.06403423012572464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.068389767904876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18093744222980887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15936785935720654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18669312095501106,0.0,0.0,0.08294863360097024,0.0,0.0,0.14919246515341542,0.0,0.20224104714947014,0.06756257046495201,0.1282204758280457,0.0,0.0,0.0649054506263703,0.0,0.07223910847539287,0.050960614750664684,0.07740144380576486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12187506610833597,0.08114222997172436,0.0,0.05660855512416254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07164423737851723,0.14960300119690356,0.0,0.0,0.08011081739629261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3249441574652556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08231239359820113,0.1461029473589307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07538108432688623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14524239873672484,0.06071229186570917,0.0,0.0,0.06083676353263692,0.2085037754429294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263060876188467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05877380458331815,0.0,0.0,0.16211130700399445,0.0,0.18290669365006545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1587025468886725,0.0574016396025556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04451715145194654,0.0,0.07236575608396129,0.14590107803208566,0.08482166205419991,0.0,0.08304100421850408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060598791626039525,0.061239034797286776,0.0,0.0,0.2123166331289563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05557977961410415,0.15506329864654078,0.07780167187739706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983268414376764

I do have to note that I am on my period and using a tampon. So I’m not sure if that blood would be able to mix? Please let me know if you have a similar experience or I’m just freaking out over nothing.

I'm really trying not to believe it's a blood clot. I googled and low and behold... made my anxiety worse.

healthanxiety,iNeedSeriousHelp0,2019/03/21,"13 trips to the hospital from 2018-present (went to the ER last night). Near trips to the hospital: Almost daily. Hey guys,

I am really suffering in a way that makes life absolute torture. I have health problems, however they're compounded *significantly* by my constant fears of death and cardiovascular/heart-related health anxiety. 

Does anyone here ever feel like suicide is rational when your life has been distilled to daily panic attacks of the worst kind and constant thinking/fears of sudden death or further disability (i.e. strokes, fatal arrythmias, heart failure, etc.)

I don't want to die, I fear the unknown so intensely, however I feel that I deserve dignity and mercy for my situation. I feel like I should have the right to end my own life because of the amount of suffering I experience on a daily basis. I want to have the option to terminate my consciousness peacefully and legally under the supervision of empathetic doctors and nurses.

healthanxiety,xLumeni,2019/03/21,"Swollen lymph node, rash, dermatits and surprise another lymph node today What the fuck is going on with my body?

In October 2018, my perioral dermatitis flared up again after accidentally eating gluten. It was around the time of the holidays and i was stressed due to major family issues. December comes and I start to notice and itch on the back of my neck. I also notice after I eat a heavy meal, I have this mild pain on the left side under my rib cage. Spleen? January - the rash is a deep red, unbearable itchy, oozing and now paired with a swollen lymph node.

I change up my diet to vegan because I figured it was keto catching up to me. That helped and the rash slooowwwwllly got better but still lingers. Fast forward to this week - the itch is mostly gone but the lymph node is still there albeit smaller. Yesterday, I finally got my hair done because I couldn't previously with it so itchy. I noticed a deep pimple on the opposing side of my scalp. This morning, I now have a swollen lymph node where the pimple is. I also am hardly eating,not very hungry and have managed to lose around 10lbs in a month but this could be due to vegan, mostly raw diet. 

Of course, I researched online and the worse is coming up - lymphoma. I am absolutely panicked. I've been to a naturopath who put me on a multivitamin, hormone rebalancing herbs, probiotics and a liver cleanse.

healthanxiety,Vadermaulkylo,2019/03/21,"Head pains are worse then ever lately. Been fearing a brain tumor for a year now and I constantly get terrible heard pains. It can be on the top of my head, either side, wherever. They go in straight lines and hurt very very bad. I had heart fears last year and had chest issues but as soon as that cleared up the head fears started and have lasted for a year now. I’m scared constantly and think I’m going to die. These pains are just so intense. Maybe it’s brain zaps from missing medicine doses but I’m not sure. It’s been going on so long now and has been at its worst this last week. It’s like I’m having an aneurysm each time in the area it’s at and it scares the shit out of me. Anyone else got similar feelings?",0.722764705882355,2.9934097000000013,1.6965098039215682,98.6151176470588,85.33333333333334,4.862745098039216,18.15686274509804,6.2272716619740125,-0.3563725490196079,565,14,129,5,17,176,97,150,0.276,0.638,0.086,-0.9861,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,1,1,8,16,1,5,8,0,12,12,8,0,3,19,26,14,1,0,5,0,1,1,0,0,4,1,0,0,10,9,0,0,2,0,0,3,1,14,0,0,7,2,5,2,16,18,3,34,0,2,0,0,2,12,1,0,20,73,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792274694615341,0.11609726220926612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09460730540239404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25297802345643344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24489102235069884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11759563881865873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465415284554347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10249341947294573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3825084315097008,0.0572918435027758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05919866470670272,0.0,0.1931863533635187,0.0,0.09062262273245528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3488595694938079,0.0,0.0,0.13427032442329384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12129837578998315,0.0,0.0,0.11826393650110235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27708301398876306,0.12781616788379327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05535648246927584,0.0,0.0,0.10027386419753677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138329451115297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3617025606029523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2268818096177848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11630885949263953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08019986545576181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10679128908432574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07260308246595575,0.0,0.0,0.06607070702659709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18698165305380104,0.0,0.0,0.09088870681787974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11547035920165935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21889958324799727
healthanxiety,Filangie,2019/03/21,"So anxious I literally just ran out of the dentists office Basically title.

A couple months ago I had a consultation to get a few teeth ""deep cleaned"" and two small cavities. No big deal for normal people, but I really dislike needles and put off going back.

Today I go back and they insist on doing the deep cleaning of the whole mouth for $500, while saying it doesn't look bad on X-rays so the insurance company probably won't cover it. When I said I can't afford that, the hygienist basically scolded me and went to get the dentist.

I started feeling like I was having a panic attack and removed the bib from my neck, put on my coat and bolted to my car. I still feel shaky now. Idk what's wrong with me. 

Don't know if I was being scammed or I just made myself look really foolish.",2.6653254972875224,4.613157069620257,4.7190235081374325,81.3306329113924,76.40506329113923,7.299095840867992,25.20976491862568,8.192908349453996,1.7229207956600368,619,22,118,11,14,213,111,158,0.168,0.777,0.055,-0.9524,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,0,9,6,1,2,11,0,10,5,3,1,0,19,24,13,0,2,5,0,2,1,0,1,2,2,2,0,4,8,0,0,3,0,0,8,5,5,0,1,7,6,18,1,14,15,2,27,0,0,2,0,5,9,0,3,11,80,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14981445932535667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19092974178071945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19226979841620745,0.0,0.2599118168467817,0.14111373953565512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18700296992724824,0.0,0.0,0.17423873908352602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17090997882629974,0.12073859517918588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17659830637283616,0.0,0.19210108306423146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09288179698316018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08256825638944558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283846536396062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15991845764617454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348997309691996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16559092239349174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19829323521600312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11716813560897353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18221807144634186,0.0,0.0,0.33979731923706946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2165403530985604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1607643067654941,0.13440110599697982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11962398544787825,0.0,0.134969164482622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16019882226658974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16509522746140973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15667113109596334,0.0,0.1886902183533882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18478256305281504,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,SheRahh,2019/03/21,"Punctured my hand with wire Was doing my art project and ended up stabbing myself with some wire an hour ago. It bled a bit and stopped, my arm kinda sore. Because of that I'm now freaking out that I could get tetanus. I don't think I've gotten that shot before and I heard you need it to stop tetanus. 
But I have really bad anxiety so I wouldn't know if I'm imagining any pain I'm feeling.
I don't even know why I'm worried the puncture was like 1cm deep, but I'm still panicing about going to the doctors to ask if I should get the shot :(
Its always something with me :( always feel like I'm about to die everyday :(

healthanxiety,AccountForMyOCD,2019/03/21,"One spot on my spine feels tender, I'm worried it's cancer. I haven't been worried about my health for a while so this didn't concern me much until today.  I notice that when I hunch over, or when I press on this particular spot on my back (near where my bra strap would be) it feels like I bruised it.  It's not painful enough to disrupt my day, but it's a little disconcerting.  I started googling and I saw a bunch of people who had this and it just went away on its own or it wasn't anything, but then of course I continued googling and ""back pain"" can be cancer.  It's surface-level though, really does just feel like a skin bruise.  And I don't feel it at all if I sit normally and don't press on it.

How worried should I be?  Any way I can rule out cancer?  I'm seeing my doc for a checkup soon.",1.763663865546221,3.1375842235294122,3.1668907563025246,93.9852941176471,77.3529411764706,6.033613445378151,22.142857142857146,6.5431188927421005,0.23228571428571465,618,17,145,5,14,202,100,170,0.157,0.802,0.041,-0.9683,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,0,12,5,0,0,5,0,14,10,2,1,1,23,24,18,0,4,8,0,7,2,0,2,8,0,0,0,16,6,0,0,4,0,0,1,6,2,0,1,6,9,19,3,17,13,5,27,0,0,2,0,1,12,0,3,14,101,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10915945185482147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13209470318831776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15081430394732392,0.2468607289940141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1035224499619862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14047258076569402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16586059753615914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3246559735318497,0.22935177003681545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17062579674661493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1568444267855579,0.16088372211409308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11800104519491755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15727601889276988,0.0,0.1827536655153926,0.0,0.0,0.10877285244941297,0.0,0.341610282144918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11128471080001552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283354960741127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12791406447977086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11361724376787685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15771058689424694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15215467510669484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12741370989091202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488041217358954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4890491118305185,0.0,0.1140291653430781,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Lallah_,2019/03/21,"Could those symptoms be caused by stress/anxiety? Afraid of cancer I’ve been feeling really anxious about some things I’ve been getting recently. It started with sudden one-sided tinnitus at my right ear for at most, five seconds. I’ve dismissed it, since it seemed to be common. But then I’ve started to feel lightheaded for one or two seconds randomly, which led to more searching, and the discovery that one sided tinnitus could be a red flag for cancer. And thus started my anxiety

Besides the tinnitus and lightheadedness, I’ve also had some muscle spasms. Not really common, once or twice a week only, and it’s just on the fingers of the right hand, along with a  a weird twitching feeling on what I suppose is the median nerve.  What left me more alarmed though, is that today, my vision suddenly became blurry, accompanied by a headache, lasting for three or four seconds. Never had that before.

I’ve been very anxious about this, and I’m hoping that those symptoms are not that uncommon or at least, anxiety/stress induced. Should I go see a doctor, or just wait to see if it gets better? 

TL;DR: lightheadedness, one-sided tinnitus (SBUTTs), some hand twitching and quick head pain with blurry vision. Hopefully it’s just all anxiety",7.3925142857142845,8.307952102222224,7.197857142857143,72.08250000000002,63.53333333333333,10.161904761904765,34.73809523809524,10.125756701596842,3.7284095238095247,993,42,159,21,14,315,124,225,0.118,0.7879999999999999,0.093,-0.7040000000000001,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,0,1,8,7,0,2,11,0,14,13,5,4,2,43,30,16,0,6,12,0,6,0,0,1,8,1,0,0,18,10,0,1,5,0,0,2,3,4,0,10,5,10,6,3,23,19,8,25,0,0,3,0,0,9,0,14,14,113,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09786966394374153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2808680462455498,0.276515975279162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10413894360276378,0.0,0.0,0.10823784365338952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12572108257057524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1954257802544382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12526421582578806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18564160973296132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12788016278630993,0.0,0.06955309560505224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12560029508959225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2431079233966069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0997585027459594,0.0,0.0,0.1329695189173578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943893365121182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303339315595156,0.33171963054565823,0.09307780821966158,0.1302241713257583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15680340413676988,0.0,0.12083847657615425,0.0,0.0,0.20902887587150928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19504685799499824,0.11141291306645802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10123650612380457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.259870013134648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28037869208326555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25440565316918456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813058463265507,0.0,0.12024070445801036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11600480146381385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955043622239055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097881577667604,0.0,0.0,0.09816828370109897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,xSisterFister,2019/03/21,"Possible mono...maybe something worse Noticed swollen tonsils/scratchy throat last Thursday. Still hasn’t gone away, but developed a persistent headache that intensifies with movement that’s been going on for like 4 days now. Obviously think it’s a brain tumour. Went to the doctors yesterday morning and they did a basic physical and did some neuro tests (because I complained of strange, intense headaches). Doctor ordered some blood work to test for mono but to only go through with it if my condition worsens

All day today I was extremely tired. Had to stay up to write a final essay but then around 3 am I start shaking uncontrollably (chills) and was burning up. I felt like I could’ve thrown up any second. My fever reached 38.9 C which to me is extremely high. I took an Advil about an hour and a half ago but my temperature is still the same. I’m too scared to go to bed because I’m worried my fever will skyrocket and I’ll die in my sleep

I’ve been so good with my health anxiety lately and now this just randomly came along :( these are the only 2 outcomes in my head:
1) I either have mono which I actually wouldn’t be too nervous about because then at least I know what’s wrong
2) I have cancer

healthanxiety,chukinator1,2019/03/22,"23 year old male with Lymphoma like symptoms Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I have had an interesting few months, and would like to share my story with everyone! Would love some feedback given I am not seeing an Internal Medicine Doctor until the end of April.. Here goes!

&amp;#x200B;

Background information:

In May 2017, I had a nice EBV infection that lasted a year. Additionally, I have thalassemia minor which I believe has never effected me, and Asthma which is mostly brought out due to my dust allergies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current issues:

In February this year, my cheeks randomly started swelling which has never really happened to me before. I didn't think much of it, but after a week of them staying swelled I visited a Doctor. He said it's likely due to the cold weather and sent me off. 

About a week later I developed a nasty lung infection, it caused my lymph nodes to swell like crazy, and a very mild sore throat for a few days. I went on Antibiotics and the symptoms went away. 

About a week after that, I got food poisoning which then eased itself out after a couple days.

&amp;#x200B;

After the food poisoning however, some of the initial symptoms came back. My cheeks kept swelling, and my lymph nodes (on my neck) were overly active. I went to the doctor, and he gave me some Ventilin and another inhaler, as he thought it was due to lung inflammation. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks later I started developing fatigue, I could sleep 10 hours and feel as if I didn't even go to bed. Then at around dinner time every day I would feel sick to my stomach, and extremely light headed, I didn't get it but thought maybe I was just stressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then got another lung infection which went away naturally, but after this one, the facial swelling and lymph node action came back harder than ever. I even started developing numbness on my temples during night time, and have been noticing almost rapid hair loss on my hairline (Never had any signs of balding before). Which now leaves to the last few days..

&amp;#x200B;

I went into the ER yesterday as I knew this was problematic. They said they couldn't find anything alarming in the blood tests, but did notice my spleen was enlarged and that they will perform an ultrasound. The results from the iron test and stool analysis won't be back until next week.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be honest, I have had health issues my whole life, this is the first time in my life where I am really really scared. I have googled the symptoms as you do.. And really the one that fits the story the best is Lymphoma..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious to hear what people think.

&amp;#x200B;

healthanxiety,juliaofbath,2019/03/22,"Chest pain anxiety. CHD &amp; open heart surgery survivor. Apologies for this wall of text. I just need help. 

So I'm new to reddit and to this sub. I know that chest pain is a very common symptom/trigger of HA, but I haven't been able to find any resources about cases similar to my own, although I'm sure they must exist out there. 

So I am a moderately healthy 25 year old woman. I excersise, I eat healthy, I was slightly overweight as a teen, but I've been at a healthy weight for the past 4-5 years. I was born with a somewhat serious congenital heart defect (CHD), an atrial septal defect (ASD) to pe precise. At the age of 5 I received corrective surgery for this defect, and have been considered healthy and symptom free ever since this surgery. I have had no major health events since this time, and I have never had any sort of restrictions placed on my physical activity levels by my cardiologist. 4 years ago I entered into a long distance relationship with the man who would eventually become my husband, and it was around this time that my HA began. I believe it was triggered by my fears that something would happen to one of us while we were apart, and that we would never see each other again because of sudden death due to illness or a freak accident. I began to be plagued by images of him dropping dead of a heart attack or getting hit by a car (same for myself). We lived in 2 different countries, and usually spent 8-9 months apart in between brief visits, and as our time apart progressed I was aware of new unhealthy habits forming (googling symptoms, anxiety induced nausea/chest pains/numbness/tingling/jaw pain). 

We are now married and have been living together for a year, and although I am happier than ever, all of my bad HA related habits have decided to make a home in my brain. I feel so unlike myself as I have never expeirenced anything quite like this before. I was so caught up with dealing with a long distance/international relationship that I didn't do anything to stop the progress of this anxiety and now it has become an integral part of my day to day life. Like many of you I experience chest pain, numbness, tightness, tingling, and nausea, and I have been to see my doctor on a few of these occasions, and have been told that I am fine. I have even been to the hospital (same results). Again, I know this is all very common for those suffering from HA. My added complication comes from my history of heart defect/heart surgery. I wish that I could just erase my knowledge of this event since it really exacerbates my HA and often sends me into a spiral. Although I know most of my chest pains are benign, the fact that I have had major surgery lends just a bit more credence to the HA voice telling me I'm dying, and this is destroying my mental and physical health. 

It doesn't help that I can't find any resources on living post-op from a pediatric heart surgery in your 20's/30's, and what to expect as you age. All of the materials I find online about what to expect after a heart surgery are clearly directed towards 55+ year olds, which is very alienating. I am always the youngest person in the cardiologist's office by several decades, and I've never met another person in my age group that has had open heart surgery. I've looked for support groups for young adults living post-op from CHD's, but I haven't been able to find anything. 

My question is this. Does anyone on here relate to my story/situation? Does anyone here have a history of CHD and open heart surgery? Since I can't find any information about this, my HA is telling me this is because they all died young and my time is limited, although I know this cannot be true. I just want to talk to someone about their experience with this and get support from people who know where I'm coming from. AH and CHD open heart surgery are an abundantly shitty combination and I know my current anxiety levels are unsustainable. I can't live like this. 

Even if you haven't had open heart surgery, any advice/resources would be welcome. I'm very overwhelmed and not sure how to deal with this.

healthanxiety,YouDontMeanLITERALLY,2019/03/22,"Unsubscribing today. Thanks for all of your support. This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns, but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.

I started off as a mess and eventually got a full heart/body checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24-hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional, comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains, numbness, tingling in my limbs, dizzy spells, being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke, and a ton of other shit, something outside my control changed: my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself ""stressed"" but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis (inflammation of the rib tissues, read: stress-induced) I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and self-adjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough, I am. Also, my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back, but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf (I know, stick with me) and it's been life-changing. Yes, this is obvious. Yes, we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just *how* much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time, it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!

So to recap, here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact:

-Get a doctor's opinion. As in, a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this - TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something, get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.

-Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job, but if something is stressing you out (a situation at work, a significant other, family) take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.

-Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety, your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fight-or-flight response. You absolutely do not to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people (like me, apparently).

-For the love of Reddit, never Google your symptoms.

The terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you, it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body, you can come out of it quickly too. Hope this helps someone.",4.843820754716983,6.733088042452831,5.4752025157232715,78.46382264150947,70.30503144654088,8.547119496855347,30.172830188679253,9.120678840339163,2.7002745660377365,2689,111,484,55,50,868,314,636,0.166,0.7070000000000001,0.127,-0.9792,4,0,3,0,1,0,92.0,4,19,1,4,27,44,7,11,47,2,48,33,12,9,7,93,91,38,0,10,18,0,2,2,0,3,20,1,0,2,36,32,1,2,12,2,1,9,10,28,2,3,24,4,58,16,69,59,21,69,0,1,1,3,41,36,4,14,24,339,94,14,0.0,0.0,0.05201319440766662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05881796927555793,0.042624058781106686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036245885591704975,0.0,0.12232325759069355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12295342622417232,0.0,0.06498247430164583,0.0,0.0,0.06005094374857287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184087577580197,0.0,0.05950052234494576,0.0,0.0,0.05434298900277988,0.1095077391211425,0.2255376906992093,0.04591330378372852,0.0,0.0,0.0597805776146339,0.042555780868406064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990009463570308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055687244563015735,0.0,0.21821958238650133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04452538176619979,0.0,0.0,0.05507323589772968,0.0,0.03520420350978731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09580535931985504,0.0,0.05024657662664676,0.05997741401989839,0.026950124504448187,0.0,0.0,0.05838763791677064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058440792189904923,0.0,0.0,0.1392354728701847,0.05113029836441847,0.030291666651495224,0.0,0.04262894709333236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16996649404477976,0.0,0.12632171489769212,0.10717777053319433,0.0,0.0,0.10587802184511733,0.0524898473185536,0.0,0.0,0.06016930834584894,0.0,0.0,0.0528921101031348,0.04737556460943878,0.0,0.0,0.08787699852577091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03764742636227498,0.052079458556888863,0.05342068768420174,0.0,0.047168898039296185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045313826305320826,0.04810540775830479,0.0504338292441533,0.03557822067236032,0.05403792049123349,0.0,0.058059418106699325,0.0,0.05369422826402322,0.0,0.056542967326510436,0.0,0.0,0.042543619397804884,0.0,0.1175450859589767,0.0,0.04110831145915528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11352570216566638,0.0722350341335227,0.0,0.22686019383905245,0.06253616569565416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03695156788738654,0.04653957841110337,0.055687244563015735,0.0,0.0,0.06008783744193976,0.05104674800159626,0.0,0.0,0.10200196617428917,0.0,0.053581307086953855,0.0,0.05669120131896468,0.053314508839262184,0.06066716569385789,0.06829079865692851,0.054801364578130125,0.052627403845609606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05560361305430905,0.060213924873539625,0.10942354278214618,0.0,0.17973458644538648,0.0,0.0,0.09032197824471383,0.1230990285017432,0.0,0.0,0.037726074553143925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5494956063850892,0.05572082161404287,0.0,0.0,0.06048430491337783,0.050234699406620696,0.11079839327089662,0.08015006140436652,0.0,0.0,0.04907155724872607,0.0,0.0,0.07082041632558682,0.06830508471138394,0.0,0.0,0.031079708237655858,0.0,0.1010444968795748,0.15279154625464267,0.0592183556875427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822687936797444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042307126621181385,0.0,0.0,0.047923177569156566,0.0,0.0,0.05950764153523853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07760619347732492,0.05412882364570359,0.05431734024944231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,littlebluefleur,2019/03/22,"Buspar, how long? I started taking 7.5 mg of Buspar twice daily as of this Wednesday. I know it's probably too soon to expect relief from it yet.

Where I live EVERYONE smokes. Go for a coffee? It’s in your face. Go to the bars? Clothes smell like smoke. Walk on the street? SMOKE!

I’m freaking out. I know it’s not as bad as me smoking, and for years there were no smoking laws (remember non smoking sections on airplanes?) and most people were fine.

healthanxiety,Kivijakotakou,2019/03/22,"Antibiotic cocktail and side effects Disgusting me has a bacterial infection in the stomach and I'll have to take 15 pills every day of antibiotics to get rid of it. Normally I won't take a look at the side effects because I know I will go insane about them, but after my mother saw the prescription she said I should consider another form of antibiotic treatment that only has 70% success rate (compared to 95%) but less side effects. SO I looked up the side effects and its worse than anything I've ever taken. It's nausea and diarrhea and vomiting in over 10% of cases and a condition with black burnt skin and multiple organ failure with unknown probability. As I'm already vegetarian and you're not allowed to eat dairy products I have to go vegan for a week and I'm not allowed to go outside in the sun cause the medication will cause my skin to burn in the sun.

I can't find the side effects for the other therapy but I also I want to be done with the whole thing if I survive the ten days.

healthanxiety,shegoesbyjenna,2019/03/22,"That awkward moment when your health anxiety was 110% accurate. Fml. I’ve spent my whole life not feeling right. My immune system has always been shit. Seizure activity as a child-teenager. Anyways, I’m 25 now and I had my adrenal gland removed a few months ago due to a benign hormone-secreting adenoma. It was found via MRI in October. 

Not even a couple weeks after surgery, I noticed extreme mental changes. Which led to paranoia. And then I lost 30+lbs and stopped sleeping completely. I would get SO angry over shit that wasn’t even important and I had to literally shut it down by cutting myself off from people. My hormones were a mess according to labs. I just KNEW something else was wrong.

A week ago today, I got an MRI which confirmed a brain tumor (of the pituitary). I have to have my concerns because I work in the medical field and I usually know what something is the second it starts creeping up. But I thought it was impossible to have another one present itself, even though my last tumor was benign.

I just want to feel normal, if only for a few moments. I’m starving because I’ve been too worried to eat all day, plus the random nausea.

I’m just now starting to figure out what’s good for my colon even though I thought I was doing things right (eating frozen vegan patties which may be even WORSE now that I think about it. I was worried about processed MEAT only and not processed meals in general).

I’ve had hemorrhoid symptoms lasting over 2 months now (itching and bright red spots). Bowel habits constantly change. Lot of gas, bloating, and nausea. Feeling hungry more than usual. I had diarrhea for the first time in a month and a half last weekend, no bowel movements at all for almost 4 days. 

TL;DR I’m nearly 24 years old and have eaten processed food most of my life, worried about colon cancer because of that but also really hoping I just have some chronic hemorrhoids, and improving my diet moving forward ",6.4663714821763625,7.305125663414639,6.2741463414634175,78.16679174484055,65.53658536585365,8.25891181988743,30.40337711069419,8.139509932561175,2.2587373358348968,871,30,147,10,13,273,134,205,0.095,0.831,0.073,-0.3457,2,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,1,16,4,0,0,4,0,15,24,7,1,1,31,29,14,0,4,5,0,2,0,0,2,8,0,0,1,7,9,10,0,6,2,1,5,4,1,0,2,11,4,17,3,26,13,7,33,0,0,2,0,2,11,0,7,19,101,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11998526530554215,0.0,0.0,0.09582228139313964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000470659121086,0.07304289075486656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12675667616452999,0.10321676632079074,0.0,0.12948592156913946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07727581872953028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12260867853101436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15828371072120642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12117205576818756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10192124599887634,0.5795610121990175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06809808096063713,0.10050171274913894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1190111159368151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1953432133368001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16926883012898067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018690931693476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1912828944964799,0.12735271545283575,0.08808357396609091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12573391359985234,0.0,0.0,0.09113066880262274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12918928705566066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07676157917142098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10232805016355764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250013539050144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08481122246603805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245418095028719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07960497023969107,0.07677763726594758,0.11772533135607635,0.095125950158203,0.06986966125538024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13196792917756267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13779035189521832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.365057729309248,0.12210971012023915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543239600803689
healthanxiety,Gnexus99,2019/03/23,"Wall of Eye Floaters Help So I have floaters. Evident by the fact I'm posting here. Whether they stay or go away in a few years, I don't care. 23, so I have all the time to wait. One thing that I've recently noticed though is that when I almost close my eyes completely and look up at the sky during the day, I can see an entire faint sheet of what I assume is the liquid my floaters are in, and I can see the entire field of my vision is in what essentially looks like a very faint wall of bubbly protiens and crap. When my eyes are wide open it's harder to see but in the sky I can still ever so slightly notice it. My question is, has anyone had this along with the more prominent floaters and did the wall eventually go away? I don't mind the individual ones but having literally all my vision be through this murky shit is stressing me out.

About 2 weeks ago I masturbated dry way too much and I injured myself, and my ejaculate was slightly pink and i had groin pain. I rested and put ice in my groin area that night, and a week later I felt better. I ejaculated again and it looked fine, but there was a weird piece of something, it looked kind of like old dry blood, it was dark red and tiny. It happened again recently, about another week apart, and now I’m freaking out. Did I injure myself really badly? Should I see a professional? Or just wait longer than I am again to heal properly? I can’t find anything like this online, so I’m freaking out.

healthanxiety,slimgunner,2019/03/23,"3 year problem I have had this numb, tingling sensation in the same spot for over 3 years now. It’s everyday same spot and never really gets worse, I only really notice when my mind isn’t busy. I am on medication for it as my neurologist said it is a migraine disorder which I beg to differ. I have had 3 mri scans even with contrast and two eeg which came back normal. I occasionally get pins and needles in leg and tingling on left side of face.

healthanxiety,morioh_jojo,2019/03/23,"I have a ridiculous fear of HIV/AIDS Hey all,

I just want to get this on paper (well, you know what I mean) 

I just found this community today, and I just want to express my irrational fear of getting HIV/AIDS.
So, today I was doing laundry (university dorms) and I realised there was some face towels from another person in the wash after I washed my clothes.

I have a small cut on my hand and I for *god knows what reason* am afraid of getting HIV or full blown AIDS, because in my brain, I touched a facecloth of someone I don't know, and don't know their history (its a uni dorm so sexual activity is obviously bound to happen)




I sound so stupid but I *can't get rid of the thoughts*




Also, to add stupidity to this, I am **asexual** so that takes out a huge risk of getting it. I also don't do drugs.


How do I talk myself down out of this.",-0.08150037697914314,2.2216023930635878,2.349258607690377,91.61661975370696,91.54335260115609,5.3208343804976135,20.23850213621513,6.8959733430537185,0.4853515456144764,646,22,141,10,23,220,101,173,0.116,0.838,0.046,-0.8759999999999999,1,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,1,1,0,12,9,4,4,7,0,14,7,3,2,2,27,30,13,0,2,5,0,2,0,0,0,4,1,2,1,9,7,0,1,8,0,0,0,4,8,1,0,4,3,24,1,22,26,3,13,0,0,0,1,6,10,0,2,3,97,33,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2640640126215197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17312383799856676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10064464415677273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18430842970833136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914658985963003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37157129249682747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18102581649599989,0.0,0.0,0.4312948920956923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14599914953888687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3629429561838009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1798444746247541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14416069436349818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697523492770968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13989038517951222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241361535687422,0.13270273019038986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13107254251310374,0.0,0.0,0.3129947741059583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947628694169218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14844652208595374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Type_O_Negative92,2019/03/23,"I just found out I'm diabetic. What now? Hey folks. Yesterday I went in for a routine DOT physical to get my medical card updated. These happen every two years to make sure my health is in check for driving a rig. 

So, I go in to my appointment. I give a urine sample. There is a massive glucose concentration. They use a diabetic meter and my glucose level was a 257. With almost no symptoms apart from occasionally dry mouth/thirst. I went and immediately got an a1c test to determine what's going on. (I understand this won't find Type I, but it's worth doing). I've taken my blood sugar three times since. Last test yesterday was still in the 250s, today it's been 157 for two tests.

I'm worried. I enrolled in insurance yesterday because I'm not financially prepared for the lab work, but I cannot continue driving until this is diagnosed and handled. 

I bought a bike to start trying to get my weight down and keep active. I'm internally freaking out right now. I've always had good health minus a little extra weight. Any advice?

healthanxiety,FuckAnxiety911,2019/03/23,"Been putting off taking an antibiotic Hey guys, 

I have been having symptoms of a UTI for a two weeks now and I was prescribed originally Cephalexin for 5 days - this didn’t get rid of my symptoms. On Monday I went to my Primary Physician and she prescribed me Augmentin but I have been too anxious to take it. I’m scared I’m going to have a bad reaction to it, but I need to take it because I don’t want this UTI to get worse. Not sure how to make myself take it, the fear is incredibly strong.

Has anyone else gone through this?

healthanxiety,nutaway404,2019/03/23,"walking mess yesterday at work i would be drinking water normally and would notice a sharp pain at the top of my head but would think nothing of it at first. several sips later, the sharp, almost electrifying pain would occur in the same exact spot it had before. so i kept sipping and noticed that it only hurts at first, and the pain goes away if i continue to drink repeatedly. fell asleep with hopes of waking up with it being gone but unfortunately the first sip i took gave me the same incredibly sharp pain in the same exact spot. i can swallow my own saliva and eat food without any problem.. when i’m not drinking anything i can still feel a slight pulsating pain in the top part of my head, my left eye is spasming uncontrollably, and my ear on the same side hurts when i apply pressure to it. i’ve tried researching the pain to see if it’s worth visiting a health care professional but can’t seem to find anything. should i be worried more than i already am?",8.355508274231681,6.927703723404258,8.185390070921986,73.58277777777779,62.29787234042554,11.121513002364068,35.782505910165476,9.994966539143718,3.3304945626477527,772,28,147,13,9,249,114,188,0.21600000000000005,0.718,0.065,-0.9877,0,0,3,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,6,4,14,0,2,13,0,14,20,6,0,2,34,25,13,0,10,7,0,4,0,0,5,7,1,0,0,7,7,7,1,4,3,1,5,3,12,0,3,5,7,15,2,22,12,7,29,0,2,2,0,2,14,0,5,10,96,22,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09752645568030233,0.0,0.10747717827099244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06623155398444723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16029463901874974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150527548268214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08287548872751499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09930011506292273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2862283965830814,0.0,0.09965881912521037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04924555151198808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08901674697308,0.24853096391823715,0.11776973453016115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19990957234165385,0.1035257275145762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09673464732789153,0.0,0.0,0.20852550897569536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10581933602259164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542586517940027,0.09345258484894484,0.22176841414587428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07407285477481686,0.6218072588056159,0.0,0.0,0.1054686795179557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319331861956594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07761075310481974,0.08866423358546342,0.0,0.11002798664657194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07777931970624252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062406419813199325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820879825563637,0.06612442661595233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09388475752496388,0.0,0.07090430691528209,0.09890877397200336,0.0,0.2767448422245978,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,-PraiseTheMoon-,2019/03/23,"Does anyone else have a fear of doctors? I am a hypochondriac and I never go to the doctor. I know, it doesn't really make sense, but when I am sick (infection, fever etc.) people always tell me, I should go to a doctor. But I never will. I don't know how to explain it, but the diagnosis would just scare me. The last time I went to a doctor was because I got vaccinated and because of my tinnitus. I'd rather just stay home and suffer.

healthanxiety,tay165,2019/03/23,"Health Anxiety is a Beast I’m just having one of those nights/weeks/month where the anxiety is piling up. My son was recently diagnosed with a form of epilepsy and my daughter will be starting speech therapy soon, amongst other things going on. I’ve had pretty severe health anxiety over the course of my life (32/f) but this year it seems to be peaking. I’m currently on the tail end of a week long brain tumor worry and I found my self going down the Google rabbit hole again tonight after reading a news article about “silent (brain tumor) symptoms”. It’s been a rough night. I really thought I could see the light at the end of this tunnel. Ah well. Just looking for some support and maybe we can cheer each other up. Thanks for reading if you did! :)",3.8481963470319616,5.729771239726027,4.268698630136985,86.128299086758,72.90410958904108,7.3324200913242015,25.865296803652967,8.07648339933343,1.5754995433789958,595,20,114,9,12,187,105,146,0.085,0.779,0.136,0.8955,1,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,1,1,0,0,7,4,0,0,11,1,12,7,2,0,0,16,24,5,0,2,4,2,1,0,0,1,5,1,0,1,8,6,0,0,3,2,0,2,0,0,2,1,6,5,9,4,18,14,3,23,0,0,2,0,5,8,0,3,13,73,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3373193198061737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32815796637247396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11735206647606028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14918223707040676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2603624092676428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1611566652058527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16706494892194754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124670554085872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10381675981413507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13007322496153564,0.12342670418163147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14766178999901214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11731852993467125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13793135669057693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09959787312739707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14953213271882593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29404079341373585,0.0,0.09415954989138577,0.0,0.14512563201812936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712452582036395,0.13380563775612278,0.15333284367724515,0.16604626610882325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10403364051834807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16679186766427367,0.0,0.1527691437830023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532000895820928,0.1680851503601071,0.0,0.0976473940191832,0.0,0.0,0.11668619570585345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11789898896382152,0.0,0.13215323053829667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492659559081772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465070140215254

healthanxiety,KF2015,2019/03/24,"How do we know that it is SVT rather than VTach? Very rarely, I will have these 5 to 10-minute episode of sudden high heart rate, above 180. I learned that this is may be SVT.  I have already seen a cardiologist and she did all sorts of tests and concluded my heart is structurally normal and there is no worry. But no test has ever been able to catch these rare ""racing heart"" issue of mine. I have had these since I was a kid, decades ago. And I do have them every couple of months or sometimes there will be 1 or 2 years between ""attacks"". No other symptoms except the racing heart which feels like it's ""lightly beating"" so fast (I once counted up to 200+ bpm). On Holter the ""worst"" they caught was a few isolated PACs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have been reading about VTach and this seems to be dangerous kind of arrythmia because there is a chance if can go to Vfib. Yeah, we anxiety sufferers are a hypochondriac bunch.

&amp;#x200B;

So how do I know what I have all along is NOT VT? Now I am so afraid to be left alone and so afraid of those attacks whereas before I learned about VT, I did not mind them too much as my cardiologist assured me I am okay. But now, I am always thinking what if these are SUSTAINED VT rather than a more benign tachycardia??",3.768806161745829,5.289992577235775,4.0415875053487405,89.14707958921696,72.41463414634146,6.967565254599915,26.36200256739409,7.475848149327749,1.1832146341463416,978,33,204,11,19,304,147,246,0.117,0.8270000000000001,0.056,-0.9345,0,1,0,0,0,0,41.0,2,0,3,2,18,12,3,2,8,2,36,5,4,3,4,38,44,19,0,5,11,0,1,1,0,3,1,0,0,1,15,9,0,0,8,1,0,3,5,7,0,0,9,3,25,5,22,28,7,16,0,1,1,0,7,4,0,7,10,146,40,5,0.11804684011750564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046414012254065,0.0,0.0,0.12226092529747493,0.1302676234903011,0.0,0.09822442751296087,0.25580740389573703,0.2868796632265969,0.0,0.0,0.09030550958148176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2685906448576437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07196025806447456,0.0,0.10044916637939312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13061658330323664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067801251954244,0.0994595541174648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059688029274092835,0.08433268616681998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06708873962927651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5595442956504767,0.0,0.1247229678054056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12321023155076599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12292761844520456,0.12975091227401425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12825823718806248,0.0,0.0,0.05767172330520065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11919365714728805,0.0,0.09422386154924504,0.0,0.08677801012987461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566083959780872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257160320930581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180787852689336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10746540971372497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09764956600758734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675134332609907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12269586620989785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07563964862480613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09740100596215598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988229626930688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868796632265969,0.07601829471799157

healthanxiety,Coco_and_I,2019/03/24,"DAE feel like they've accepted death since having HA? So my health anxiety has gone a bit mad, every time I'm reassured by my doctor of one thing, something else pops up straight away. 
I'm not really sure how to cope as I've only really had significant HA since early last year. 

Recently I've been having palpitations &amp; arm pain, I'm checking my heart rate/BP almost hourly. I feel like I've now began coping by just sort of accepting that I might die as I'm too embarrassed to seek reassurance from anyone in my life. 

Does anyone feel the same, or have any better advice other than the 'roll over and die' approach?

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! I am a 20yr old male (soon to be 21) that has indeed been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. I have dealt with these issues for around 6-8yrs of my life. Part of my anxiety issues is changes in eating habits. Things such as me not eating when get a full blown anxiety attack, feeling some stomach cramps when eating certain foods or eating them in certain locations, and sometimes feeling discomfort when I have a BM but not all the time.

I am writing this because this week has been super stressful causing me to have a few anxiety breakdowns (one major one yesterday). Today is the aftermath and my mind is really letting me have it. As of now I'm hungry which makes me anxious which makes me not eat which makes me feel sick which makes me more anxious. It's perpetual :T

I don't want to keep going through this. I have been to many doctors, have not been given meds and have underwent many tests. I also did go see a therapist for a while but stopped going when my anxiety issues went away.

**my point is**

Should I go back to my psychiatrist, reopen my case and perhaps get medication?

Or perhaps this is seems more like a digestive issue and I should see a gastroenterologist?

Or should I go back to see my therapist?

Or lastly do all three?:&lt;

healthanxiety,donkeykongo-,2019/03/24,"Struggling with fear of carcinogens everywhere  

Hello, just wondering if anyone has advice, info, anything relating to this would really be great; I have a problem with fear about contamination but mainly in the form of long-term damage, ie being exposed to a unknown carcinogen, or drinking water with lead, or exposure to anything that is deadly / harmful, but only through exposure over time.

This is mostly fueled by any story of ""new chemical used in products and only 5/10/20 years later people confirm it's a carcinogen / otherwise dangerous"".

Because of this I get stressed out with chemical things like cleaning products, detergents, anything scented, general air pollutants, clothing dye, any drinking water, plastics touching food, heavily processed foods, and so much more. 

 I'm struggling to get over it because these cases do happen, and I wouldn't know there was a problem until it was too late; I can't shake the feeling it is rational to at least have some skepticism... but I know it's impossible to know about everything and I want to stop stressing out so much. any coping tips or advice would be great, thank you.

healthanxiety,Hocelyn,2019/03/24,"Pro tip: don't Google symptoms if you're logged into Facebook. They will use the data from your searches to give you relevant ads and articles and it will exacerbate your HA. There have been times where I've frantically googled the symptoms for everything from MS to brain tumors to ruptured ovarian cysts and shortly afterwards I would see an ad or an article about something related to it-- nearby gynecologists, cancer centers, etc. But since I've stopped doing that, I don't see them as much anymore. It's been really helpful in taming my anxieties. 

Googling something once every so often doesn't affect the algorithm too much I don't think, but when you're a chronic symptom-checker (like I used to be), triggering ads definitely start becoming more prevalent. So resist the keyboard and just breathe.

healthanxiety,throwawayanxiety19,2019/03/25,"Super anxious Hi everyone. So, Im freaking out right now. I'm really scared that I have HIV. I moved to a big city at the beginning of the fall for college, and I decided to try hooking up. However, it was always an instinct to use a condom when participating in sex. I've always topped too. But, I stopped after a couple months because I felt like I was doing too much. But, about a month ago, I hooked up with another dude. I've topped every dude I've had anal with and I've used a condom every time. However, I'm so scared that I have contracted HIV. I keep looking up the risks and everything. From information to ""use condoms"" to ""condoms don't always work,"" my anxiety has skyrocketed. As I type this, my cheeks and neck are red hot causing me to think I have a fever. It's more of a deep blushing feeling because my face is only affected along with my arms. But when I tell myself I'm good, my cheeks go back to normal causing me to think I'm jinxing myself. In addition, I feel a little more tired than usual.

I'm just so scared. I protected myself but I don't know if something went wrong along the way. I don't recall a condom breaking but sometimes the other dude would give the condom to me, and Im scared that they might have done something to it. I'm just so frightened. I tell myself that I should go to a nearby clinic and get tested, but what if something results that makes me fall into a depression. The semester isn't over and my life would completely change. I just need some piece of mind. My spring break wasn't even relaxing due to me freaking out. Any advice?",2.4079937304075223,4.402154689655177,4.014106583072103,85.87564263322888,77.3385579937304,6.907836990595611,24.47962382445141,7.873277556716777,1.383478996865204,1242,43,248,20,29,414,166,319,0.14400000000000002,0.825,0.031,-0.9862,2,0,3,0,0,0,42.0,0,0,1,4,15,13,0,5,19,0,21,19,6,8,0,54,46,22,0,7,11,0,4,1,0,4,6,0,0,0,11,16,0,4,8,1,0,6,5,9,0,0,7,6,36,4,36,35,5,39,0,1,2,9,6,16,0,4,15,157,47,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061409140319702,0.09127034142987757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25701998246040897,0.0,0.0,0.07001825902502909,0.10796551073102076,0.07876628749214172,0.11631869713990395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07917206514007855,0.0,0.1255303779577457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21154238937354636,0.10892102779038004,0.0,0.10795457428606917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11392641932241235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886817395192225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10536672885854594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0680059819170824,0.0,0.1735012596631852,0.09838540189088027,0.09253635764908416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10412220683834444,0.0,0.0988604690049767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05379383202118868,0.09877133408284508,0.11703230462050684,0.08636034155014356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2224350621439932,0.0,0.0,0.09151809923054634,0.0,0.0,0.05658568179232335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272569583077698,0.050302440671418334,0.1031958106832305,0.0,0.0,0.08646285013883145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06872849235216573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922729760029393,0.1039631126562878,0.0,0.16436790627289696,0.1094331997236472,0.07568953129840186,0.07634563803741029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10088171791028402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07830787623621809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06596062906628522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792969911212557,0.0,0.0,0.4123350422078198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23779746370266724,0.10183287726447901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608154101941567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17998811335255327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13194885532449935,0.0,0.0,0.060038457504388826,0.11834063319712565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06990500678520231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26678049439222024,0.1133990170484643,0.0,0.0,0.08172710645658803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09544758023842796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07495817067421051,0.0,0.0,0.14628368867256933,0.1125736974659549,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,19Peachoid99,2019/03/25,"Depression or fear of it? Hi guys, this is the first time I post in this subreddit, so, let's get started!  
   
For about two weeks I have been feeling very frightened about the idea of ​​being depressed, also because this anxiety is accompanied by a kind of weight that I feel inside my chest and that accompanies me all the days. 

I haven't lost interest in activities or in socializing, but when I am at home alone I start to think and look on the internet for symptoms and feelings about depression, and end up feeling scared, anguished and sad with this feeling of heavy head and the impossibility of thinking positive.

What do you think, is it all the fault of anxiety and hypochondria that have been with me for years, or is it the beginning of a depressive phase?

healthanxiety,metallicadad420,2019/03/25,"Random Twitching / ALS Fears I was hoping to find some relief here. About 5 months ago I had some bad panic attacks, with high blood pressure, likely due to high stress. Same deal, thinking I had heart issues. I've been on the generic version of Buspar and a blood pressure medication since then. Things seems ok, until I started to have panic attacks again. A friend told me he had twitching issues with the Buspar, so I'm hoping maybe thats it. 

For the last 3-4 weeks I have been having all sorts of weird twitches EVERYWHERE.  Mostly been in the bridge of my nose, but also in my back, head, arms, neck, abdomen, legs, knees, elbow, and butt. It's very random just a small twitch here and there, and there seems to be no pattern to it. They usually will last a couple seconds. I've been having bad anxiety and stress lately. My wife and I had a baby recently and when I got back to work from my leave, a bunch of people were laid off. A week into being back at work I started having bad panic attacks, chest pain, reflux, I started to get spasms in my esophagus, and trouble breathing, which made me think I was having a heart attack. I then started obsessing thinking I had a heart condition. I got checked out by the doctor and some blood work done and everything checked out ok. I was relieved to hear that things were fine. My doctor switched out my blood pressure medication, but then I started getting muscle twitches all over. Thinking it was because the medication, I went back to my old BP medicine, but after being off of it for over a week, it's still happening My family has a history of ALS, seems to happen later in life, 60+, but when I googled muscle twitching, my anxiety completely went off the rails. The twitching seems less severe, but it's still happening.

I went back to the doctor do more blood work, check for an electrolyte imbalance. I should have the results back at the end of the week. I started CBT last week with a therapist, but the unknown leaves me constantly fearing the worst, and I'm finding it hard to find relief. I haven't been sleeping well because of the baby which could be contributing to the problem. 

Has anyone else had issues with muscle twitching following panic attacks?",5.739857142857144,6.782088414285719,5.7966666666666695,80.22000000000003,67.23809523809524,8.095238095238095,30.952380952380953,8.192908349453996,2.286452380952381,1754,67,312,22,28,553,197,420,0.212,0.7390000000000001,0.049,-0.9971,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,0,0,1,4,20,36,5,12,29,2,36,36,20,2,2,54,68,25,0,5,7,1,1,1,1,2,16,1,0,0,14,19,0,0,11,0,3,4,2,25,1,1,25,3,35,11,49,36,12,63,0,0,0,1,7,19,1,13,41,215,49,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052801930816576505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04763514849136848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911361127323926,0.0,0.0,0.04165014185984254,0.06103271344420445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3388263269048622,0.0,0.2748168467854623,0.14920611693524838,0.07262212706190026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0624541321253348,0.06437000885192083,0.0,0.0475588434982922,0.06590897784538255,0.0,0.0,0.0614102396263076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18290589589475587,0.0,0.06095700575232722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04976000016704013,0.0,0.05275806147701778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05353434947275704,0.0,0.056153806259627584,0.13405729555874854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16332755686072375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04602077552480262,0.0,0.06224186635531801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09528122299426192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15802284678298387,0.0,0.05335970467662551,0.0,0.06113220855230105,0.0,0.06713554910881378,0.21175905646635992,0.0,0.125870132474873,0.0,0.11832555220668195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865152237848193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14566345382503718,0.06719338078727978,0.12614422175119713,0.0,0.0,0.0420734391882862,0.029101085310147694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05636307319701918,0.0,0.0,0.05984235448187286,0.0,0.0,0.18002034130216896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047545252266613984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06250481159133271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633827428061235,0.27955287452012706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041295772238488807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056996904378303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05881453499712306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21690768901903573,0.0,0.06729296398846354,0.0,0.0492738587998712,0.0,0.059609317946947016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2529680018363735,0.0,0.0951394480542818,0.0,0.13646599051243705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06916106523000208,0.07914640567700236,0.1526707191190579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05691815219070453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06560386385166636,0.049148435686562915,0.0,0.0,0.23890246388976544,0.0,0.05355725721495265,0.16565567026714262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734599029682673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I woke up yesterday and had muscle aches all over my body but most noticeably in my right calf. Not striking pain but very sore like I worked out too hard. I worked out on Thursday so possibly it’s a delayed pain? I also have some pain in my back and shoulders, as well as one side of my neck when I turn. Wondering if I maybe slept on it in a weird way? 

Now I’ve been freaking out about possible blood clot/DVT. I’ve been having some pain around my heart but I think that might be anxiety about this. I don’t particularly want to go to the doctor unless the symptoms get worse.

healthanxiety,_kingofnowhere_,2019/03/25,"Health Anxiety: A Hypochondriac’s Guide - A NEW PODCAST! Hello everybody,

As a longtime reader and occasional poster on this here sub, I just wanted to let you know about a new podcast episode I’ve recorded, in which I discuss my experience with health anxiety. I also share things that helped me overcome and deal with this often hellish condition. 

[The episode can be found here on iTunes.](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/heavy-mental-podcast/id1454724561?mt=2)

We’re also on Spotify too — just look up “Heavy Mental”. 

I’m also the dude that wrote about health anxiety in a blog post, which I think some of you might’ve already read?

[You can read the blog post — that I reference during the podcast — here.](https://rhysowenking.wordpress.com/2018/03/04/healthanxiety/)

healthanxiety,desertfool,2019/03/25,"seizure worries? hi everyone! 

i need someone to tell me i’m not losing it. lately i’ve been worrying that i’m just going to have a seizure. i’ve completely convinced myself that it’s going to happen when i’m not at my house. 

yesterday i went out to eat with my parents and we were sitting in chairs at the restaurant and i leaned my head back to laugh and of course, i hit my head. at the time it didn’t feel hard enough to do anything but now it’s really worrying me. i’ve tried to avoid googling anything so i won’t further my own worries.  

my cousin has seizures  but no one else in the family does and i’m just feeling crummy about this. the rational part of my brain tells me i’m fine but the panicky/anxious part tells me not to go to school or work because you’re going to be uncomfortable and definitely have a seizure.

healthanxiety,igot99symptoms,2019/03/25,"Maybe you do have a health condition, but it's more likely to be benign/chronic than whatever you're imagining I used to have bad health anxiety. Until I was diagnosed with POTS: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

What is POTS? At it's core, it's an increase in heartrate when you're standing. To be diagnosed you need to have a standing heartrate that's 30+bpm higher than your supine (lying down) heartrate.

But what is POTS really? It's a complex condition of the autonomic nervous system. There are dozens of possible symptoms, all somewhat benign, ranging from heart palpitations to nausea to trouble regulating temperature. Some people with POTS aren't affected much while others are confined to a wheelchair because of their fainting spells. Yes it can be a terrible experience, but it is *not fatal.*

So why am I telling you guys this?

Because there's a 100 conditions like POTS. Simple, relatively ""harmless"" conditions that make you feel uncomfortable, but pose no risk to your life. To name a few:

* Raynauds disease - intensely cold fingers/toes
* Fibromyalgia - pain/aches in muscles
* Arthritis - pain in bones
* Asthma - difficulty breathing
* TMJ - jaw pain, headaches
* Crohn's disease - abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, vomiting
* Cyclic vomiting disease - recurring vomiting spells
* Ovarian cysts - pain in pelvis, back or side
* Hypothyroidism - fatigue, weight gain, hair loss
* Anemia - fatigue, coldness
* Sleep apnea - sleepiness, snoring

I'm not saying that it's easy to live with these conditions. No way. Most of them suck. HOWEVER, they are not cancer, they are not heart disease, they are not multiple sclerosis.

So when you're listing your symptoms, focus on what the *most probably cause*. Neck pain? You probably have ""text neck"". Stomachache? You probably ate something that your stomach doesn't agree with. Headache? You probably have some environmental or dietary trigger.

/r/healthanxiety is very near and dear to my heart. I spent many anxious nights terrified because of heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, muscle cramps. I can't tell you how much of a weight off my shoulders its been to have a diagnosis. (I should've mentioned that the caused of my POTS is mitochondrial dysfunction, which comes with another huge slew of symptoms)

I hope anyone here with an undiagnosed chronic condition can find a diagnosis and treatment asap. I know it's hard to keep your head on straight until that happens, but try to! You are your best advocate.

healthanxiety,delinde24,2019/03/26,"Health anxiety is affecting my relationships I’ve been a ”worrier” for all my life about everything. Health anxiety is just a part of it. Now I’ve come to the point where it’s starting to negatively affect my relationships especially with my partner. The worst of it being that i got drunk, lost memory for a bit, became convinced that i was taken advantage of and contracted an STD and created a weird situation in my relationship. There was no indication that this had happened, other than a minor cold that i was sure was a symptom of a disease.

Understandably he is upset and i felt guilty. It was awful and we’re still in the middle of it. This has to serve as a wake up call that my life is so negatively affected by all this. I’ve been festering at home all evening not being able to do anything but worry. My head is in pieces. All i’ve managed is to use reddit as an occasional distraction. I need help, i feel like i’m lost in this. 

The point of my post was to hear success stories of others overcoming these fears and honestly to just find some hope and support.

healthanxiety,Ocdgirl55,2019/03/26,"In need of some advice/support Hey all! First I want to say thank you to everyone in this sub. I’ve been quietly reading your posts for months now and it is truly the reason I don’t feel so alone anymore. 
I’ve been dealing with health anxiety since I was 12. I saw a poster in the nurse’s office at school which explained the symptoms of menengitis and spent almost a year touching my chin to my neck to make sure I was okay.  Then, it turned into having anxiety about HIV/AIDS and lymphoma. My anxiety was so bad I had to drop out of my dream college because I couldn’t handle it. 
I felt happy for years after that. I focused on other things. But this January something changed. I suddenly began feeling everything I used to before. Constantly worried about various diseases even after being reassured that I was okay. 
It’s straining my relationships with my family, my boyfriend, and my friends. My constant reassurance seeking is making everyone lose their patience with me. I feel like I can’t handle it anymore. I sleep most of the day because that’s the only time when the terrible thoughts don’t come. 
The worst part is this feeling I like to call “happy...but”. It occurs in situations where I feel happy but cannot truly experience the moment for what it is because I’m worried. “I’m happy...but I could have a disease” “I’m happy... but it will only be for a little while until the anxiety comes back.” 

Anyone else feel this way?

healthanxiety,Imsoafraidd,2019/03/26,"My fear if brain eating amoeba is ruining my life ? I'm new here, but I've been to counseling multiple times and I still can't get myself together.
So, it all started in December when I was taking a shower, and a droplet of water got in my nose and I snorted it, it ruined my entire Christmas cause for two whole weeks I was waiting to die. It totally traumatized me, I never got over it even when a month passed. 

When I shower, I hang a towel nearby and wipe my face whenever it gets wet . When I wash my face in the morning, I dry out my nose with a cloth after, even if I'm late for work. When I brush my teeth , I hold my breath. When it's raining outside, I breathe with my mouth . Sometimes when it's raining a truck will pass by and water will splash on my face and I'll need to go to the nearest gas station and get a tissue to dry my nose out if anything even got in there. I don't go swimming anymore, even though I used to do it as a sport. I'm always careful when drinking water, I'm even scared of my own spit when I laugh of it getting up my nose. I guess I'm just scared of water as a whole now, I know my fear is irrational and I can't even get the infection from most of these things. Also, I live in Canada where we've never even heard of this stuff before.

I even read you could get the intention from soil or dust. So I'm afraid to breathe in or touch my nose with a lot of things that I think have dust on them or dirt. I never even put my hands towards my face anymore without washing 4-5 times first.

I've started having severe existiential crisis caused by this, I'm always scared to die and it keeps me up at night. I just want to be normal again like before and not worry about these things anymore, but it's so hard.",3.2327642276422743,3.770025956639568,4.4607089430894336,89.37067317073172,72.63143631436314,7.204813008130079,25.058102981029812,7.087006719466742,0.863820509485095,1354,38,304,12,25,447,180,369,0.152,0.809,0.04,-0.9924,3,0,2,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,1,2,32,11,0,6,14,0,15,27,17,4,5,48,46,34,2,7,12,0,4,1,0,2,4,1,2,0,21,15,6,3,2,4,0,7,8,8,0,2,7,12,46,3,45,35,7,50,0,2,0,0,3,17,0,9,27,203,67,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06809739533119788,0.1417094252426178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533488121672087,0.0,0.0,0.07007425209527159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449190796438657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09505970825876717,0.0,0.0,0.08681988790897491,0.17495264449249395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06798831261719729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17675222481181532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08341822260045395,0.0,0.08713350936309479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5061890324507755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916432076274415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243170670251499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.266935809811805,0.0,0.09678963750500794,0.0,0.2043156151089561,0.0,0.09380641767772133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762810029820429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07568853470326169,0.0,0.0,0.04679825494689114,0.0,0.09605709985222834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060146587385300064,0.04160180399754878,0.0,0.07519229066623917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07239464359153053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06796888310966047,0.0,0.0,0.06314040088923173,0.1970273843142039,0.08224198882807571,0.0,0.07991099330411995,0.0834325611127709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08560300345400085,0.0,0.0,0.08517675906840556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2557611724941236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0961994602065912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08421920177066919,0.0,0.12054447589484032,0.0,0.06800386700713598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974806311290642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06402499636768777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697170339693642,0.054563062384662284,0.08366309289756646,0.0,0.09930763231661377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08318280649387973,0.0,0.0,0.07354546943074053,0.0,0.0,0.050225867519221916,0.0,0.06830517399162288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.190142164154886,0.0,0.0820851427967997,0.0,0.061992918887833925,0.08647773130999949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,uoliram,2019/03/26,"Shortness of breath/Lymphoma/PE Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I need to say I'm so glad I found this community ! I've read several post and it's good to see that I'm not alone with that hell that is health anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always had anxiety but rarely experienced physical symptoms from it. For 5 days now, I really have trouble breathing. It feels like I'm always gasping for air. I did have chest pain for the first days but not so much now. I feel like something is stuck in my throat. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this started because I found a painless lump in my neck about the size of a pea. Of course, I googled it and found it might be lymphoma. I also googled shortness of breath and found it might be PE (which is scary because my grand mother had two PE in fall).

&amp;#x200B;

I did a pulmonary Xray and blood test 1 month and half ago and everything was normal but I can't help but think of the worst. I'm fairly young (F 23) but the fear of having cancer or suddenly faint is intense. I have a doctor appointment coming up (not related to this) and I don't know what to tell her without sounding crazy lol.

&amp;#x200B;

healthanxiety,Danoria_1013,2019/03/26,"Anxiety over therapy Hii! 
 I live in Belarus and in my country there are no CBT practitioners. All our doctors can offer is pills. Maybe talking therapy. I don't want to spend my time just talking about my anxiety, it's not gonna help. 
I've been struggling with anxiety throughout my life. 
I had OCD (sometimes still have it), but overcame it on my own using Internet and articles of Dr. Steven Phillipson. 
I had GAD (just general anxiety 24/7) and overcame it by accepting using the book by Claire Weekes ""Hope and help for your nerves"". 
Now I suffer from severe health anxiety. 
I've read some books and other sufferers on forums told me some techniques. What I've been using is more ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) than CBT. And it was quite helpful for me. I have always had problems challenging the thought, it's much easier to accept it and let it float past me as clouds as ""just anxiety"". 
Lately I've read on Wikipedia that CBT is a gold-standard approach. And developed anxiety - ""what if (yess classic what-if thought) the approach you've been using is wrong and is not recognized by therapists?"". I lack confidence, although I have tools. But I continue googling.( 
I understand this is just another anxiety about the therapy) maybe a sign I'm recovering.

healthanxiety,angsty_,2019/03/26,"Panic, pain and tingling in limbs - is my birth control driving me crazy? Hi there everybody! It's my first time posting here but my anxiety is skyrocketing recently, so here's a quick summary of my problem:

I feel constantly stressed and pressured due to mental health reasons. Last year, during a very stressful stretch at work, I passed out the first time and I've had dizzy spells ever since. Had blood work and an examination with a heart rate monitor made, nothing major except for a slightly lower blood pressure. Thought I was going to die the entire time, of course, but it got better then aside from me growing obsessed with my health.

Fast forward to today. After stressing for a whole month that I might've gotten myself pregnant I finally started birth control on the 16th, thinking I might finally chill, but nope! Now I'm convinced I'm developing a thrombosis or something worse. I had a panic attack last week that my SO had to talk me through, thinking I was having a lung ebolism, and now suddenly my right foot, wrist, upper arm and leg hurt, I get tingles in my right little and ringfinger, and occasionally there's this burning sensation around my knee and elbow that just... make no sense whatsoever? Travels to my left side sometimes, too, and my hands are often cold.

Can someone please tell me that I'm okay? I've been to my doctor so many times this month because of different things and I'm so embarrassed to turn up there so often for little to no diagnosis. I should know my symptoms are too much over the place to be anything serious, but I just want to go through a single day again without me obsessing over every little pin &amp; needle that I'm feeling. :(",7.008157894736844,7.594868850318477,6.826600737512572,75.55442004693262,64.31847133757961,9.285685551458263,35.63459604425076,9.134995656068208,3.2446012738853494,1345,60,232,21,19,425,191,314,0.22,0.731,0.049,-0.9958,2,0,1,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,7,22,18,1,10,14,1,16,18,11,5,1,43,37,22,1,3,9,0,3,0,0,2,7,0,0,0,10,15,0,2,8,1,0,7,4,15,0,2,11,4,30,3,33,23,4,58,0,1,0,0,3,20,0,4,32,149,40,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10272454007032916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07252793935046074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07801899065603167,0.08439931222100988,0.0,0.10785790418888792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0577941396569447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08385006267022521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10245387822738156,0.2126706985883712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06114338320408901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098395842721783,0.0990542888362702,0.0,0.09704011085959977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08575935709681726,0.07987991587984562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958756511580032,0.0,0.0,0.20771528546831566,0.0,0.16128744808409484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0495333207960435,0.0,0.10776325966115388,0.0,0.07582670091336174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.201553160281894,0.0,0.11234805862597116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10149403520860134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05210405400340274,0.1545625157486142,0.0,0.0,0.10300928139472408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850678787876736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897097194926994,0.06328514499891584,0.0961205357968994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09554426879482077,0.2011528299225528,0.0,0.0,0.15134984670328955,0.0,0.06969486451958233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909709318882336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10088250613907196,0.22247376282087386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990542888362702,0.10407082683629268,0.0,0.0,0.09079995536465428,0.0,0.0,0.09071855052786916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747852022739548,0.0936115640508492,0.0,0.0,0.16193120400513364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784262425827607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08033059807072168,0.0729879096512414,0.09376763817715664,0.0,0.06710566333044309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3258070852445521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854192046825612,0.0,0.07620316198380776,0.08286646092301994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06298629092952633,0.12149840853287358,0.0,0.07526704367291838,0.22113346931619485,0.0,0.08986699609368297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10312399131242952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07822661414388092,0.05592027558632587,0.0,0.07604934154938539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10584986128962692,0.0,0.09139162812833902,0.0,0.13804285639393665,0.0,0.09661755671530484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06105330997393035
healthanxiety,mmattstokess,2019/03/26,"Bad Tattoo Experience making me lose my mind I got a large elbow tattoo Wednesday and it's RUINED my mental since, to make a very long story short basically the tattoo artist wasn't as clean as I'd like him to be, he didn't even wash his hands before putting on his gloves and tattooing me, the needle and grip were new but the tattoo wire was not covered in plastic or the workspace. He says that he uses a very strong cleaner between every client but my mind doesnt want to accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

To make it all worse he didn't do the tattoo i even wanted, and did a fucking terrible job so now i have a huge bad tattoo with a terrible story with it and just waiting til i can lazer it off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't stop thinking I could've got hiv or hepatitis c because of this, do you guys think I am being crazy? I went to my doctor and asked the opinion of many people in the tattoo and health field and they all say I'm fine but I can't stop thinking that I could've ruined my entire life and it wasn't even my fault.

ANY ideas on how I can make myself feel better?

healthanxiety,Daintyfemale,2019/03/27,"Bleeding after having bowel movement So I’m a 24y female. And every time I have a bowel movement I bleed. There won’t be blood in the stool, but when I wipe. 

This has prompted me to... inspect my asshole if you will (I feel weird admitting this). Anyway, i have tears that bleed. It feels slightly painful while in the process of defecating but after I’m ok. Now, I know this probably just anal fissures but at times I worry that it could be serious. I’ve been taking cymbalta for almost a year to help me with my health anxiety.

I just need to know if anyone else has anal fissures and how to combat them? This is making me nervous Everytime I use the bathroom. Sometimes the blood is minor sometimes it can be a good amount. It seems like when the year is ALMOST healed I make it come back ☹️.

I also do strain.. if that could be a reason.

healthanxiety,R43N17,2019/03/27,"I’M [23F] FREAKING THE FUCK OUT -All last week was getting headaches and I never get headaches or have allergies 
-Friday and Saturday when sitting down for a while and would stand up my head would feel very heavy, got dizzy and dull pain enough to make we wince.
-Monday morning woke up sucking from my throat a decent amount of blood mixed with my mucus. 
-Constantly since Monday morning sucking up either bright red blood streaked all through mucus or just straight up like dime to penny sized black blood clots in mucus. Seriously every couple of minutes sucking it up. Occasionally will stop for 30 minutes or so but always starts up again
-Havent been sick or coughing or had nose bleeds
-Went to doctor on Tuesday they sent me for blood work which still isn’t ready, referred me to and ENT. Saw them today they put a scope down up my nose and down my throat didn’t see anything ordered an XRay of chest and MRI of my brain. X-ray won’t be ready for 24-48 hours and MRI people aren’t even calling me schedule until Monday. Going on four fucking days of spitting up dime to penny sized blood clots and I’m just sitting around here probably fucking dying while I wait on all these tests. 
-Did ease up a bit today just smaller bits of bright red and dark black blood throughout the day towards end of day started to turn more brown than red or black and I started to feel better until I just spit up a huge black clot.

healthanxiety,whatdowehavehear,2019/03/27,"Kidney infection anyone? (21M) Had some weird urinary symptoms. Left it longer than I should have. Health anxiety struck and I'd convinced myself it was a UTI that'd spread to the kidneys, and obviously death was imminent. Went to the walk-in and they said urine looked good (no UTI), but they'd do the STI tests. Whatever.

Now I'm convinced that they didn't look hard enough into the UTI and that it's already spread to the kidneys and gone septic. I started feeling sick and got a fever last night. Probably a cold or something cuz I was out in a big city all weekend but obviously it's all connected in my mind.

Taking everything in me to not go to the ER and wait to go to the non-emerg clinic tomorrow.",2.2786930091185407,4.572350531914896,3.4853748733535994,88.01250000000002,79.1418439716312,6.8654508611955425,24.965045592705174,7.957251820313856,1.492347112462006,559,21,113,10,14,181,92,141,0.08199999999999999,0.84,0.078,-0.1421,0,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,3,0,1,4,0,0,11,0,10,10,4,1,4,23,23,11,1,1,4,0,2,0,0,1,6,1,0,0,7,9,0,1,1,1,0,4,3,1,1,0,9,6,9,3,13,11,4,17,0,0,2,0,4,7,0,2,6,66,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2395452352687767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16606009965610075,0.0,0.0,0.15178235060881354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2242942320624577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1950910378320493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10975853118450984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24673495205932386,0.1820703676757965,0.17361295003049346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19445459347688615,0.0,0.0,0.2307382381338865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17694330624981053,0.0,0.0,0.23585023491781498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36457296561139335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21918164989030325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20370812010619244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23404119542430066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2064859442222496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16711324847944448,0.0,0.0,0.15364524678269845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2256217573505101,0.16321173233614467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20122866255323169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,honestlynott,2019/03/27,"Got a bloodtest, scared to hear about Leukemia. I've posted this in r/AskDocs but I just wanted to hear more. Sorry. I'm seeking as much support as I can that isn't from people close to me because I don't want to scare them too.  

I'm a 18 year old female living in Canada. 5'9, 60kg, Half Chinese Half Russian.

I have always had pretty good health for my entire life, so such a sudden change in health is scaring me to death. For the last week, my skin suddenly changed. I have never really bruised, no matter how hard I would hit my knee on something no bruise would ever appear. My family always joked about how even if I fell off a building I'd be completely fine since my skin was ""so thick.""

For the last week, I've noticed weird changes in bloodclotting. I pick at my acne sometimes (gross, I know) and it would be fine the next day; however, suddenly now when I wake up, I see a HUGE blood scab and bruising around a small white head I picked at the night before. It made me look diseased but I brushed it off as something silly.

Then my legs and arms started having weird red dots all over, paired with bruising in odd places like the middle of my thigh where I would never get hit or hurt. It isn't a rash, and my doctor appointment confirmed today that it wasn't a rash too.

Not only were my legs and arms covered in these red speckles but my chest, upper belly, and my gums were too. The days before I was surprisingly out of breath. I was out with my friend and constantly needed to sit down after a couple minutes of walking. Even in the bus, I was extremely uncomfortable with standing and would squat in the middle if there were no chairs because I could not stand to stand. My friend joked about it and so did I as I usually would walk quite fast and wanted to go everywhere. Such a sudden change left her a bit weirded out too.

I finally decided that I was freaked out enough to go in a walk-in clinic. The doctor said it MIGHT be hemophilia and sent me to get my bloodchecked. Now I'm waiting anxiously at home and can't get the thought out of my head. I know it's useless to be afraid and think about it but I've never had such a sudden health change in my life. As I'm typing this I feel strange little zaps in the joint of my right hand. I haven't really told my friends and definitely not my parents as I don't want them to worry.

All I can do is wait.

Some pictures of my skin:

healthanxiety,Squidlake,2019/03/27,"Concussion worries I hit my head on a concrete wall last weekend and got a mild concussion (confirmed by doctor yesterday) I’ve been sitting letting myself heal at home, and was playing with my cat with one of his toy lightsabers. I held he tip as he played with the handle of it. I thought to myself while daydreaming “could you imagine if I hit myself in the head with this” and while in he daydream apparently my body acted this of and I hit myself in the head with the handle at it’s full length. Now I’m worried that I’ll cause serious damage because my doctor gave me a pamphlet to avoid head injuries after concussions because it can cause permanent damage. It wasn’t super hard but it was still a hit. I’ll just keep resting and try not to worry about it.

healthanxiety,Toan290,2019/03/27,"Extreme fatigue. Anyone else relate? For the past 5 months my fatigue has been very overwhelming. Worst I've felt in all my life. My symptoms are fatigue, malaise (generally feeling unwell), light body aches randomly, not all the time, very tired, sometimes my body feels heavy and unbalanced, which then triggers anxiety because I fear I might pass out. It's so bad I can't focus on life or work. I struggle daily to get out of bed.

Few facts about me. I'm 27, 171lbs, white male, 5'10"", fitbit tells me I get around 6.5-7 hours of sleep per night, I eat alright (should eat more veggies), I got a cubicle job without windows, I drive 1 hour total per day for work. I don't excercise much, mainly light walking with my dog or in hallways at work, I suffer from depression and anxiety, I stopped taking the 5mg Lexapro cold turkey after being on it for 5 years, 2 months or so after I stopped the symptoms and fatigue started, I reinstated 0.5mg Lexapro using liquid solution made from water. I have only had 1 blood tests in my life at age 26 and I didn't fast. They found my vit d was 20ml but everything else checked out.

I want to die. I feel like death. If there is a God please show me mercy.

healthanxiety,Grompson,2019/03/27,"I turned down additional medical testing! Had a problem and went to a surgeon for an opinion. TMI *She confirmed that I had some internal hemorrhoids that likely caused some pain/bleeding injad a few weeks back that caused me a lot of worry and distress* END TMI. 

I had an open conversation with her about my medical anxiety and was given three options of:

- Wait and see if symptoms resolve, then possibly book a relatively non-invasive treatment
- Book treatment now without waiting
- Have invasive colonoscopy you have no real indication of needing just to get a full medical workup and ease my anxiety

I CHOSE THE FIRST! I'm proud of myself. I listened to what she thought it was, what to look for, and I decided not to feed my anxiety and see if my symptoms go away on their own.

healthanxiety,keswickbill,2019/03/27,"Chiropractic adjustment on neck now scared of cervical artery dissection This will sound ridiculous and it is embarassing to even type but that is what we are all here for to get these issues out in the open and find people who can support us right so here it goes. I am a 27 y.o male and have been seeing my chiro for years because I would get headaches. He uses the drop table method and I have had my neck adjusted 100s of times before. Last week I went to my doctor for an unrelated visit and mentioned I was seeing a chiropractor. He responded right away ""dont let him touch your neck"" he told me that an older patient of his had had a stroke days after a neck adjustment because of a torn artery. Now I will mention that the chiropractor this patient had seen was using a different type of manipulation on the neck as opposed to the thompson (drop table) method. At my chiropractic appointment yesterday he did what he normally does and worked kn my back and neck. this time my neck was sore all night and I have not been able to sleep or focus on work or my kids because all I can think about is ""what if he tore something, what if I am going to have a stroke????"" seems silly right? Anyone who has health anxiety knows that these ludicrous thoughts seep into our mind and pollute our rationality and thinking. I have all but convinced myself I am going to have a stroke and die and leave my kids behind fatherless no matter how crazy I know it sounds. My neck hurts as of writing this but very mild discomfort perhaps a 2 out of 10. I would assume if you tore an artery you would feel it? Anyways I would love some responses maybe just to reassure me or if anybody has some insight on an issue like this they could share.

healthanxiety,marconova7,2019/03/27,"Fear of MS . Ok, first time posting here. I'm 21yo.
So to make it clear, i've never had panic attacks or stuff like that so I don't know if I truly suffer from health anxiety.
Now, in the past few weeks I have had 3-4 episodes where my finger would  get kinda tingly for a few minutes at most and three days ago my right hand felt tingly for 30 minutes or so; I then went to see my doctor, who thinks I have anxiety, who told me that it is almost certainly anxiety but if I keep having these symptoms for the next 15 days I can come back and he'll make me get an mri or something like that i'm not sure.
For the past three days I only felt tingling for a few seconds in my feet and I am CONSTANTLY fearing that the symptoms will come back, like I can't go 2 minutes without thinking about it.
Also since I was younger, wherever I laughed a lot( like a lot as in those cases where you laugh for minutes and almost cry ) my face goes numb/shaky or trembles and the same thing happens when I'm anxious sometimes, and especially after I am relieved.
Lastly, like 2 years ago or so my left lower back and hip felt like they were sunburnt for 3 days for no apparent reason.
I can't go on like this, I am CONSTANTLY thinking about it and expecting symptoms to show up...I don't want to die..",4.589266917293234,4.524212992481207,5.355404135338347,86.27791823308273,69.45112781954886,8.15375939849624,29.782894736842106,7.6454224807358475,1.6710909774436082,1000,35,217,10,16,326,151,266,0.116,0.7240000000000001,0.16,0.9357,2,0,1,0,0,1,28.0,0,1,1,1,15,19,1,4,10,1,18,12,5,3,4,45,43,24,1,5,10,0,5,7,0,3,7,0,0,0,15,10,0,1,8,1,0,5,8,6,0,4,9,6,25,13,24,31,7,39,0,1,1,0,6,9,0,13,31,136,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16888776994062227,0.0,0.1907819705957345,0.0,0.0,0.07618086947846985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2186251705534064,0.10761877875437773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837411030842416,0.0,0.2197514545298576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16411930270816616,0.0,0.2058884415386968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046406724392735,0.2457440576403439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098866763573916,0.0,0.0,0.09750454320179024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21439213813825328,0.0,0.0,0.2743989539859813,0.0,0.0,0.08102968355206899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09954077287635693,0.0,0.10827901281356857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423974205777962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10125889516241812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08467311202142548,0.0,0.0,0.05235342313152988,0.07765112467767381,0.0,0.0,0.10350228208692984,0.0,0.0,0.3257809068165544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1619764417585608,0.0,0.0,0.12717605328184595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347181379025125,0.0,0.10131206145618787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245093191900674,0.0,0.11176925925825452,0.0,0.0,0.18187643570671636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091234522427359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09794505078946347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135310201510616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07591136329866177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07880158926372861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07333722856205713,0.09421640852000274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10905203056011616,0.0,0.0,0.08978316913550803,0.2970406213380975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06328774226097228,0.18311984681595805,0.0,0.0,0.05554795259740186,0.0,0.0,0.09102678296009603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056187909086910695,0.0,0.07641331242189323,0.0,0.0,0.0883086921783981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09182902692696217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06767128722088653,0.0,0.0,0.061345510090959274
healthanxiety,grentrees,2019/03/27,"Tips for letting things go? TLDR at end

I am 17, recently coming off a fear of 
having visual snow. I had read about it and essentially convinced myself that I had it. I am no longer anxious about that however, and I am now on a depersonalization scare. I have had HA for a few years, all over things that haven’t been problems. Recently, for about a week, I have been afraid that I have depersonalization disorder. I don’t have the same symptoms, and I don’t truly believe I have that disorder, but sometimes when I think about it (the disorder) or when I think about the fact that something could be wrong with me, everything feels surreal for a few seconds. I have wierd thoughts where I think “I’m actually here and doing things”. This can often happen after i have been on my phone for some time, or when I have been distracted and I snap out of it. I believe it is just snapping back to reality, and my brain has taken this and made it into a problem. I’m pretty sure everyone experiences this from time to time, but since my brain  thinks it’s a problem whenever I think about it I feel that feeling. I realize it could also just be an awareness of how many things I do without really thinking about it every day, like tying my shoes, and my brain thinks that because I am not truly thinking about what I am doing I am depersonalize. In conclusion, do you guys have any tips for realizing that you’re ok and letting things go? 

TLDR I have HA, feeling weird, I know nothing is wrong, how I do convince myself that I’m ok so i can forget?",4.984999999999999,5.765644224422445,6.051833333333337,78.65775000000002,68.8019801980198,8.964290429042904,30.001485148514853,9.120678840339163,2.4315453465346533,1212,45,237,22,20,404,145,303,0.121,0.7609999999999999,0.119,0.3375,1,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,0,1,0,1,22,18,0,4,11,4,43,5,4,3,3,53,66,20,0,5,8,0,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,29,13,0,0,17,1,0,3,6,10,0,1,10,4,39,8,31,50,5,27,0,0,0,0,3,9,0,4,16,188,68,1,0.0,0.0,0.08768796390220528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185901520426985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061106185527809276,0.0,0.0,0.10151340502829756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909487565722049,0.0,0.05477630172238377,0.0,0.0,0.20247727707114485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30093208357783074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07740428502167024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14348781377937886,0.0,0.0,0.05795065774133488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30895346081460523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07958707932886536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07570882445461376,0.08586269788603487,0.08075813248300485,0.08789788331918594,0.0,0.10111467629354567,0.1817386201034913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10213618302522212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889730584664054,0.0794606959302894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04938333540374476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18377077614324525,0.0,0.04389983862738624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0850253449836075,0.0,0.0911014075437574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08622070062215259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09141738811207588,0.0,0.2579444935954555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08988182286823622,0.0,0.057565019373227125,0.0,0.17744689366744162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08996303942576367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433105764989019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06917669827553308,0.08887137123374511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08468963612734012,0.09339635471541677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29848667155606645,0.4606164932354984,0.0,0.07133682270299528,0.15718990335457653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07207827131305325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08661942935690448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19649015381679594,0.0,0.05786528786713021

healthanxiety,anxiousb1tch,2019/03/27,"Ready to look into medication but anxiety began with...medication.. Help me? So my story with health anxiety, being a hypochondriac, what-have-you, actually started with medication.. 

I was using Xanax for a good while, things kind of spiraled for me and went from a “when I am having a panic attack” use to a full blown addiction. Blah blah.
I think it might be important to add I ABRUPTLY kicked this addiction in a single day after being given a (clearly not RX)  Xanax, laced with something horrible, almost died, huge ER bill. The whole 9 yards. That was enough for me, was the last time I have taken so much as an ibuprofen. This was the middle of 2017. This RUINED ME. My anxiety over this one night has vastly affected the past 2 years of life, without a doubt.

Fast forward through a long time of the absolute hell of withdrawal and just pretty much (seemingly) permanent drastically increased anxiety, that didn’t exist on a scale even close to this before even being put on Xanax. 
Went through a decently long period of CBT, talk therapy, lifestyle changes, etc. kicked a large amount of the anxiety. The agoraphobia, social anxiety, extreme fear of any male (lol) 


BUT, here we are, present day..... I just can NOT kick my health anxiety. 
I can’t. If it’s not one thing, it is another. This is an every other week thing, where I am completely obsessed with a new thing. I won’t name them all as I completely realize that can be very triggering but I am currently fixated on breast cancer. 
I don’t think I can do this any longer, the constant obsession and panic and symptom analyzing, noticing every mark or spot on my body, etc. And I sure as hell know that I can’t afford it either. I am going absolutely insane over all of “my diseases” 

So the point is, I am ready to seek out a medication option.... But how does someone who’s anxiety has literally all stemmed from a single pill, go about this? 
What are some of your experiences? How can I convince myself to begin a medication when I can’t even take a Tylenol? How do I shake the fear of another medication further screwing up my brain? 

Getting very desperate and need a little push or insight to really shake this thing.

It’s almost 3 hours later and I’m still around 100. I’m normally around 80. Of course I’m freaking out thinking that I’m having a heart attack. No other symptoms to speak of other than just feeling incredibly anxious...which I know isn’t helping the heart rate.

healthanxiety,Explosives_are_fun,2019/03/28,"I am doing much better! Hey guys had an awful panic attack that sent me to the ER back in August and started a whole slew of anxiety related problems and oh boy I don't wish this upon anyone. So I have had pretty much every symptom under the sun from anxiety and SSRI medication. I could barely function, work, study, I couldn't leave the house. Then the health anxiety started up and I wa sure I was dying all the time. Pain would be all over the place and move around and change the type of pain. All just anxiety. Life was brutal. But since we rarely see posts on this. I AM DOING WAY BETTER!!! I feel like my normal self and honestly feel like i am a better person I am much more compassionate, sympathetic and understanding because of my experiences. And for everyone battling anxiety, I know it can feel hopeless, but you can get better. Take things one day at a time. Just try to do 1 thing better everyday.

healthanxiety,Orpher,2019/03/28,"Concerned for Co-Worker (Vision Problems)   

I’m reaching out on behalf of a co-worker. Over the past three weeks, he has been having progressive problems with his sight. I’m not sure of all the details, but he has been to a family doctor, an optometrist, and a doctor that specializes in how the nerves relate to eye sight (not a neurologist, can’t remember the name). I’m not sure of all the tests performed, but he claims to have explored just about every route possible, and no one can tell him anything! I asked him what the next step was, and he told me there were no next steps.

He is 64 years old, and has had cataracts previously, but has been fine in the six years that I’ve known him.  He wears glasses due to being farsighted.  The problems started about three weeks ago, and have progressed to the point where he can’t make out anything that he can’t make anything out (glasses or not) that is more than about 10-15 feet away from him. I was talking to him this morning and standing about that distance away, and he said he couldn’t make out the details of my face.

From his explanation, if you take each eye and break it off into quadrants, each week he starts having problems in a new one. So, he had problems in one quadrant in his right eye three weeks ago. Then problems in another, and so on. Currently, he has blurry vision in three of four quadrants in his right eye and one of four quadrants in his left eye. Beyond this, I don’t have much more info.

Does anyone have any insight as to what this could be? Or what steps he could take?

Thanks everyone!",6.017745098039218,6.11267816013072,5.655032679738562,84.79764705882354,66.41830065359477,8.368627450980393,30.398692810457522,7.793537801064563,1.813837908496732,1231,41,248,12,18,379,149,306,0.096,0.872,0.032,-0.9569,1,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,0,1,0,3,11,11,0,0,16,0,31,10,8,4,4,52,45,21,0,10,11,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,12,18,0,0,5,0,0,4,11,6,0,11,10,8,16,5,44,30,7,50,0,0,7,0,31,26,0,3,18,166,28,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1678570684725947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438597421335375,0.0992807402905314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06620279415867544,0.0,0.2337419071464855,0.0,0.08851346936126021,0.0,0.17791085828960942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15118932065764645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19381896972606408,0.08285552748003967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07977238927538155,0.09047125760228128,0.0,0.0,0.08925633169611298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287062027903987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1895998700022255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06960104804459195,0.0,0.0,0.0914429991111838,0.2013875325955221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09935123845754494,0.0,0.2566317787024138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0903832329975914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950365853886379,0.10673801698911503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5435786040205479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10725452878480528,0.16171322790523834,0.09006281960434702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13403066437453412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17847046680247014,0.0,0.14237587804893567,0.07610058466925639,0.08275491412093755,0.08716906672432523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09047125760228128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037878851720065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785703647343386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219422518450534
healthanxiety,jlg90,2019/03/28,"Terrified that I have Lung Cancer Hi all. 29 y/o F. Never smoked a cigarette in my life, but I have fully convinced myself that I have lung cancer and it has consumed me fully. I spend the entire day googling symptoms. I have had a weird on and off cough since September. It doesn't keep me up at night, though. It is somewhat productive with clear mucus. My breathing also feels strange, like I have to do a little cough when I exhale sometimes. I've recently noticed pain in my mid-upper back near my spine. 

&amp;#x200B;

In December, I started having a bad pain below my shoulder blade. My PCP ordered a chest xray, which came back normal. I had a CBC in December which was normal, except for low B12, which I've been supplementing with B12 vitamins now.

Do you think it's worth me asking my PCP for a low dose ct scan?",3.815213675213677,5.562084358024695,4.639135802469138,83.99764957264959,72.7037037037037,7.206837606837608,26.659069325735988,7.882392219407189,1.6422112060778726,654,23,123,9,13,211,107,162,0.199,0.728,0.073,-0.9716,0,0,2,0,0,0,30.0,0,1,0,0,6,8,0,0,8,0,15,17,6,0,3,16,21,6,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,11,0,0,0,9,5,0,1,2,0,2,1,2,6,0,0,5,2,21,2,16,16,2,24,0,2,1,0,3,13,0,1,10,81,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12291360362965252,0.0,0.3330671460469928,0.37352394510344106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436884821684334,0.0,0.0,0.2363711814093185,0.12833283892895336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17579152370441894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912359855542308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07771519221388243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13661536551551182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10856265156100774,0.07508991528917637,0.1540474891271945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854269267324155,0.0,0.0,0.14423676719004455,0.30118616715208485,0.0,0.17498814007716978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3270946590055758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15175992247843267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12714198951071312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15201294460822468,0.0,0.10878944677561407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15975285065224554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09848456890532303,0.15100918601700342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37352394510344106,0.0

healthanxiety,leviiipriiice,2019/03/29,"my mum died of adult death syndrome and I’m scared it’ll happen to me too I’m 15 years old and I’ve been worrying about this pretty much every day since my mum died, I’ve had a lot of problems with high blood pressure the past 2 years and thats made me really depressed and just worried all the time, but that got better about 3 months ago, but the past 2 days I’ve had a really bad pain in my left arm and I was convinced it was a heart attack when it first come on, but I went to my doctor today and she told me it’s just a trapped nerve in my shoulder so that made me feel a little better, but to be honest this is making me feel the same way I did when I was in and out of hospital with high blood pressure, I know a trapped nerve isn’t really something to worry about but I think it’s just been kind of a shock to me so I thought I’d come here looking for some reassurance, all in all I’m terrified what happened to my mum will happen to me and the idea of death just terrifies me all together, it’s causing me to have severe anxiety and today was the first time I’ve been outside in months, I just want to start doing the things I enjoy again and stop worrying and thinking I’m going to die everyday.

healthanxiety,vietusernam,2019/03/29,"Seeking post-cancer anxiety advice I had cancer at 21 and been clear since but it created some serious anxiety. I get real aches and pains from the scars but also the fake aches and pains from anxiety, the trouble is differentiating between them. I usually get weird looks when I see a doctor about these aches and pains, so I feel embarrassed to see my general doctor. I have trouble keeping up with my cancer tests and follow ups because I’ve always been needle-phobic and get panic attacks when it comes to anything related to medical emergencies. I know better then to search WebMD, but if I hadn’t searched WebMD when I was 21 I wouldn’t have suspected a tumor and seen a doctor, so I have a fear that cancer is back or that there’s a real unrelated issue. I’m trying to see a psychiatrist, but does anyone have advice on how to deal with the health anxiety so it doesn’t get to the point where I feel the need to go to an ER? Is there any benefit to seeing a cardiologist or checking on these anxiety aches and pains?

Is there such a thing as health related PTSD?",9.426757044125466,6.950905253588519,9.839872408293463,65.876884635832,61.05741626794258,13.11664008506114,37.57628920786816,11.645159339076185,4.2960330675172775,854,30,155,20,9,290,111,209,0.349,0.602,0.049,-0.9972,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,1,1,15,15,1,3,15,0,15,13,0,1,1,31,34,25,0,3,7,0,2,0,0,1,13,0,0,0,8,11,0,1,4,0,2,3,3,13,1,0,6,8,15,2,22,27,1,16,0,0,6,0,2,7,0,4,6,106,23,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20242992148710515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08283107469248238,0.08618497029006372,0.0,0.0,0.07043640945034693,0.0,0.3961834065809186,0.0,0.0,0.07242395837120635,0.0,0.08523564787013388,0.0,0.0,0.11783462288029414,0.0,0.07964488227624557,0.0,0.06314002392667249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0916060866149572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08922304453968072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10678409339464187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3180485923603067,0.0906415710892224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11655374458957506,0.1047440267133419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2164603593924366,0.0,0.05886561192717633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22019657076365956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10810824165132916,0.0,0.09206464712605818,0.0,0.0,0.05692361260119853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08697920798695817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043436678504184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.076801575695116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4408560375991883,0.12152615118891999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09791443582506086,0.0,0.0991988355271962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12107682565144938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2357882696612908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3301521679364227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08568057008111384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881244257547771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07032248086590788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11407623821719527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,SAL16,2019/03/29,"Don't know if I legitimately messed up my neck or if the stress is making it this way For the past 3 weeks, I've had stiffness and discomfort in my neck. For the first 2 weeks, I'm pretty sure it was a legitimate issue of carrying heavy bags on my shoulders while traveling. It started to feel better but then I felt the back of my neck with my hand and I noticed a hard lump where my skull meets my neck. It seems reasonable that it would be my spine but I've never felt it before now and it's close to the surface and large. It seriously freaked me out and now I can't stop messing with my neck and pushing on it. It is now stiff again and hurts. I convinced it was my own fault from messing with it and being super stressed out again. But this morning I also noticed that when I move my head side to side in a certain position, there is a crunching sound that almost sounds like sand grinding. It makes my head and neck feel almost dizzy but seriously uncomfortable. I don't know if that is real or anxiety. I'm going to the doctor on Monday but I'm afraid they won't take me seriously, but I think I may have legitimately messed something up I. my neck. I'm young and this came on rapidly so I don't know if I screwed it up from traveling or what. But I'm seriously scared since it's near my spinal cord and I will go paralyzed or have to get surgery. Has anyone dealt with this? ""Crunching/sand sound in neck"" seems to be a common Google search but no satisfying answers.",3.3513763317016974,4.6864758940397335,4.456697379786927,86.49701266916212,73.17218543046356,7.503829542182549,26.04434206737691,8.04050195162591,1.3776272386985309,1168,39,250,17,23,382,150,302,0.145,0.748,0.107,-0.7817,0,0,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,3,12,23,1,5,11,0,21,20,15,3,3,60,44,32,0,5,16,0,7,1,0,4,4,3,0,0,24,19,0,3,12,2,0,7,7,17,0,1,6,10,31,6,29,31,1,45,0,1,0,1,2,18,1,13,20,160,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26299056169005497,0.0,0.0,0.10501437631459022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045735493049418,0.0,0.0,0.09182009103253068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097487772482057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11174132792354248,0.0,0.0,0.11613945718083447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1501919777637818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13440879399609454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327959184257534,0.0,0.2521703520536975,0.0,0.0,0.11169840590483177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0686078555747987,0.0,0.14926126567497427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11763448387196515,0.0,0.2695388156506584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14057785743796633,0.0,0.0,0.1370611164183254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21650561810581267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06415498682609541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17531059974733698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13956947998742306,0.0,0.0,0.10127997691159876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29901117288893675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12535719658240052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13359687673994233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14946780645249888,0.0,0.1350160281993537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13147149943268496,0.0,0.0,0.2390926280444008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10862700577955103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10109445285684958,0.0,0.0,0.09294704219374386,0.0,0.0,0.10978712079091033,0.3008469866408232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12376497636296235,0.0,0.09873424716754677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08414280661208065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10423353952756552,0.21066959201312133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932840235423582,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,galacticmoiz,2019/03/29,"i need advice 17-Male here
Hi, so a week ago i woke up and my legs were tingling. I thought it was normal and it would go away but then hours went by and it was still there. I started panicking and googled my symptoms and regretted it instantly. I’m hypochondriac. Sometimes the tingling would spread to my arms and hands. When i start moving, the tingling stops. When i stop thinking about it, the tingling stops too. My right knee is kind of stiff too and before this tingling started my legs were stiff but this stiffness has been happening to me since years. I’m afraid of going to the doctor. Should i be worried about it? What should i do? It’s consuming me.

healthanxiety,Doin_me_a_grow,2019/03/29,"TSS I’ve used super absorbent tampons over the course of the last few days. I may have left one in a tick more than 8 hours yesterday and now I’ve convinced myself that my hands are redder than usual and that I’m going to die. No fever, chills, vomiting or diarrhea. Some peeling on my feet (pads of toes) but that could’ve been there for weeks because it’s been a bit since I got a pedicure. My hands and feet do feel a teeny tiny bit tingly, but that very well could be because I’m having a mini freak out. 


My understanding is that if I actually have TSS I would know that *something* is up relatively quickly.

I’m a 16 yr old female and earlier today when I was brushing my hair, on the left side of my neck, in the back right at my hair line I brushed past something that sorta stung but I didn’t think anything of it, then today when I was washing my hair I felt it again and now I’m spiraling. To me it feels relatively small. When my neck is extended it feels harder but when I’m relaxed it doesn’t feel too hard. It feels under the skin. I had my sister look at it and she thinks it’s merely a pimple or something and my mom says I should update her in a well about it.

I'm 20/F. I had a 3hr 40 min test last week and the very next day my inner upper thigh started hurting. 

It hurts to walk and I couldn't raise my leg. 3 days later and the pain is still there though it may be a bit better. It feels like it spread a bit to my knee and the rest of my thigh. I'm paranoid that if it is a blood clot then it broke off and is moving around. Reading all these stories of active women getting DVT and then PE is stressing me out.

healthanxiety,anxious12345__,2019/03/30,"Dvt... This is my first post here and I'm just at my witts end and need help.

Woke up this morning and felt okay besides my usual chest tightness. But a couple hours later I accidentally pressed on the inside of my thigh and felt the pain so I looked ane there's a little bruise there .. it is probably the size of a nickel or dine and is a bluish color.

healthanxiety,Hackuzated,2019/03/30,"I need surgery, or some operation. I can't handle my anxiety anymore, what should I do? I've had anxiety for 6 years, I am 17. I've gone through therapy, a lot of medication. Zolof, prozac, and some depression medication. My parent's don't want me to move up in medication anymore. My therapist switched hours, so I had to leave counseling, which wasn't doing nothing anyway. And my mother pulled me off my medication. I just don't know what to do anymore, my anxiety is being my depression back. I literally can't function with it, I'm afraid to drive, hangout with friends, work, go placed alone, meet new people, and performing in bed. Just stupid shit, my head is constantly overflowing with thoughts I can't control. I try so hard, I'm aware when I'm having a panic attack, then it just leads to more thinking. I vomit when I have an anxiety attack. Just today, we had to play basketball in gym, and I went to the bathroom to fucking throw up, I don't even know what causes it. I just want to get surgery, I don't even care of it will fuck me up, I'm just at that point. I can't live life like this (No I'm not suicical). Please just give me some ideas of procedures I could do. And don't tell me to meditate, see a therapist, or stay on my meds longer. I've tried it all. I just need to know if there's any surgeries I can do.

healthanxiety,suspiciouschonker,2019/03/30,"i can’t tell if it’s all in my head or not and it’s trying me crazy New around here but I’m so glad this sub exists since I know I tend to be very aware of my health. Sorry about the length. TL;DR at the end. 

Four years ago I started to develop occasional constipation. It was nothing a little dried fruit couldn’t solve and it only happened every so often. So far, so good.

Then it all started going downhill after I had a kidney stone when I was 17. Ever since then, I’ve been struggling with constipation daily. Since diet change wasn’t helping I went to my mom’s GI doc and had my first colonoscopy at 17. Fun. The test came back clear and the GI sent me home with directions to take Miralax daily. Fast forward a year, no change. Miralax helps but it was like going from hard stool constipation to soft stool constipation. Went back to GI where I was diagnosed with IBS-C with no further testing and given a prescription of Linzess. 

Two years go by, still no change. Linzess works but not as well as it used to. Not only that, but I was now dealing with worse symptoms and felt as if my guts just weren’t moving. I was still have a bowel movements almost daily, but it was never without a laxative of some sort. I tried the low-FODMAP without much change either. I did eliminate dairy and gluten from my diet (cleared a ton of my acne once I did that).

I decide to get a second opinion. Saw a different GI. He suggests a blood test and does an endoscopy. Ended up getting diagnosed with GERD and chronic gastritis. Also, he found food still in my stomach despite not eating anything 13 hours beforehand. GI sends me to get a gastric emptying study done. That test ended up turning out normal too. Blood test was also normal besides for a low % of lymphocytes and a low number for bun/creatine. Neither of those were that much lower than the “normal range”.  All and all, I was given a clean bill of health.

But if these tests are coming back normal (besides the GERD and chronic gastritis) then why am I still having symptoms? Why is it getting worse over the years? It was just constipation at first which I’m sure is just affects your colon. So why am I having upper GI issues now? I constantly deal with regurgitation, constipation, nausea, cramping, slow moving bowels, gas, bloating, low grade fevers, etc. I can’t even do exercise without throwing up. I used to swim varsity in high school and now I can’t swim an entire 50 yards without running out of the pool. Doesn’t matter when I eat or what time of day it is. 

At first, dried fruit did the trick but when things get real bad not even an enema or magnesium citrate work. But on other days they do. Why it is that when I try to talk to a doctor about it they don’t listen? Is it because I’m only 20? Even my parents are sick of me constantly feeling ill, especially on vacations. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD but wasn’t given any medications until last year so I know it didn’t start because of medication. 

What if it really is all in my head? What if I’m just doing this to myself by stressing over it? I’m transferring from community college to university this fall. What if I can’t do it and have to go home? Who’s gonna believe me if these tests just come back normal? But I just know something is wrong. Why else would I still have these issues if everything was okay?

I’m going to a gastroenterology motility clinic at Stanford at the end of April to get one last opinion. I just feel like I’m wasting so much money. I’m probably the only person that wants a diagnoses at this point. I just want answers. But at the same time, what if the results were right and there is nothing wrong? I dunno. I just have so much anxiety now around food and eating/shitting in general. It wasn’t like this last year, until things slowly started to get worse. 

TL;DR: Been having bowel/stomach issues for years. GI doctors slap on IBS diagnoses, but I’m worried it’s something worse due to worsening symptoms over the years. But also worried that there really is nothing wrong and that the stress/anxiety was it all along. Stressed about wasting money on pointless tests that’ll all come back normal even though every day is a struggle.

healthanxiety,sleepytimerich,2019/03/30,"looking at my computer causes sickness &amp; pressure. Is this anxiety??? For the past two months ive been dealing with the worst anxiety due from insomnia. But this is not my first bout with this. Ive dealt with this back in 2010. I wanted to ask. Does anyone get these weird terrible feelong or pain in your body when you look at your computer screeen??? Its like a pain in the throat all the way down going into the chest area??? Its like a weird MILD pressure on your body. It feels like reys coming out the computer. I ahvent felt this in years. I forgot how i got better because it was so long ago. Back then i thought i needed glasses &amp; thought it was the monitor. i thought all kind of things. But now im thinking this can all be related to freaking anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this common with anxiety??? 

&amp;#x200B;

healthanxiety,WorriedReddit92,2019/03/31,"Do you ever find your ""symptoms"" change or transfer to different areas? A couple of months ago I started getting this sharp pain in my upper right abdomen just below the ribcage. I'm 27 and regrettably eat a fair amount of takeout so naturally I assumed this to be gallbladder issues. I ended up getting it checked at the ER one night when I got some really sharp pains and found a ""bump"" in that area. The doctor was convinced the bump was just fatty cartilage and since the pains seemed to happen at random and not after meals that it was likely not my gallbladder. They scheduled an ultrasound anyway which turned up with no issues which I was happy about.

&amp;#x200B;

That said since then I started getting neck/back pain, which didn't really concern me given my crappy posture and I've always had a fair amount of neck tension. However in the past couple weeks I started getting random shoulder/arm pains that come just as quick as they go, and today i started getting quick sharp chest pains, though I'm convinced the chest issue comes from some recreational smoking last night with some friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, thinking about all this made me wonder if many other people here have dealt with anything similar, and honestly typing this all out has helped me deal with some of the anxiety which is a welcome bit of relief.",8.752573599240268,8.628023921810701,7.627572016460906,73.66971509971509,60.81069958847736,9.78144982589427,36.3877809433365,9.057496981413335,3.3322468502690725,1075,43,173,14,13,328,147,243,0.121,0.78,0.099,-0.7016,2,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,2,2,0,14,15,0,1,14,0,11,14,4,1,3,37,35,15,0,1,7,0,3,1,1,0,8,1,0,0,15,14,2,0,6,0,1,3,4,7,1,1,11,4,18,8,27,23,9,36,0,0,0,0,9,13,0,11,21,117,33,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07796491428681435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07318383529118931,0.19059380020822309,0.2137447328893498,0.0,0.0,0.0672837063695385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07237771961481843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676303295884864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960217566685942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09304247647887967,0.15152722275807873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19463636003377366,0.0,0.0,0.09067554907091993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189203146250316,0.0,0.09002349141060073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08999774555086228,0.0,0.0,0.07790013882793204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07955840815303672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08038733163979614,0.0,0.0,0.09643578447361284,0.06795217075807293,0.0,0.2297587275880584,0.0,0.04998564405248988,0.0,0.07034394641453491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07777643427214691,0.09362746775876933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058952956158403236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27539984259447314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07169332962236477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042969330605362184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322313413144154,0.0,0.08917040749483543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020314333936821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1650756246286787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059599142329454735,0.0,0.5615283419057758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0839609684327696,0.06097544717002711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11268972397585082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511127215196439,0.08366332231076877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08006899142223718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14551104925528666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2490139820706188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09141671059808544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056356649019011225,0.08641325021372823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08336903863023397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09566746847160038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055048871139734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953811379041368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2137447328893498,0.0
healthanxiety,MuslimTwin,2019/03/31,"Anyone been able to smoke? I smoked weed for 3 years and last March 2018, I got laced with a large amount of PCP and had a near death experience (not breathing, hospital, etc) and since then every time I smoke I think I’m dying.

Ever since I got laced I’ve had health anxiety (a headache means I have cancer, always checking myself out, my side hurts it means I have stomach cancer etc, you get it)

And I am coping with it as much as I can. I’ve gotten a lot better than I used to be, I used to have panic attacks daily, and it’s been at least 4 months since I have had one. 

But I can still not smoke weed, when I do smoke it resets my anxiety, last time I smoked was November of 2018 and the next 2 weeks it’s like I didn’t make any progress. Panic attacks every day, and all of that.

I’ve just been wondering if anyone has been able to smoke since they developed health anxiety. Also I can’t drink, does the same thing.

healthanxiety,re-finance,2019/03/31,"Hand cramps and twitching - ALS? My left hand has been pretty sore for 3 or so days. 

Basically the thumb is “cramping up” when I use my phone or type. 

It’s in my left hand, I feel a little bit of the same thing in my right hand though not nearly as bad. 

The cramp isn’t normally at rest. It usually begins quickly after using my phone or typing. My dominant hand is right. 

I don’t type a whole lot at work. 

I’ve had twitching randomly all over my body, face, chin, jaw, calves, quads, glutes, forearms, ankles, biceps, triceps, shoulders. Which has left me absolutely terrified of ALS.  This has been happening for 3 weeks. My PCP ruled out electrolytes as the cause through a blood test. Magnesium is in line as well. 

White Male, 24yo, 6’00” 185lbs

PCP tested reflex, said 99% sure it’s nothing but ordered an EMG if I wanted and I said sure. I was anxious. Thursday the hand pain started after the PCP visit. I now have it in right hand a bit (was just using my phone with thumb). Some forearm soreness was there earlier. 

I’m in good shape athletic and pretty strong and have no obvious clinical weakness. 

hands generally alright at rest. The iphone and the keyboard aggravate it

The twitching started before anything else.  

And really, I haven’t noticed any twitching my hands. Maybe once or twice, but generally it’s in the arms, legs. Including back, shoulders, forearm, bicep, tricep, abdomen, calf, quad, glute, hamstring

healthanxiety,olrazzledazzled,2019/04/01,"How to cope with panic attacks triggered by health anxiety? I can't stop worrying about something that probably isn't a big deal. I can't calm myself down, I'm freaking out and I'm all alone and everyone I know is busy, so I can't call them.

I found a spot on my body that hurts to touch and afterwards an area near it started to feel strained (without having to be touched). I Googled it but can't find anything that matches closely with what I'm experiencing and somehow that makes me feel worse. I'm jittery right now and nauseous from the anxiety, but also I'm worried that that's related to whatever problem I just found on my body.

Does anyone have any tips for quickly calming down? I'm not in a full blown panic attack, but I definitely feel myself headed that way.",5.171168831168831,5.873709753246758,5.893922077922081,80.23516883116886,68.35064935064935,8.757402597402598,34.23116883116883,8.841846274778883,2.8719579220779226,618,29,119,10,10,202,98,154,0.225,0.7120000000000001,0.063,-0.9708,0,1,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,1,0,8,10,2,3,5,0,9,4,3,3,1,29,23,11,0,1,6,0,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,10,9,0,1,7,0,0,0,7,8,0,0,2,6,14,2,19,20,2,18,0,1,0,0,3,12,0,1,5,75,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14882561473615902,0.0,0.114913558350593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771813872304266,0.0,0.21985393853065646,0.0,0.0,0.100475513533641,0.0,0.1182494810243502,0.0,0.0,0.3269496589859832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3192274992797892,0.0,0.0,0.14672957883449456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14814416199206992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257492493852204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13730758925123598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217970892028498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13133544822807644,0.0,0.0,0.3151102722458828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14747344843164262,0.15274202089609484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15382943164949012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07897150800541353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09591812826271164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3371923524502668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15492848281741112,0.13749756859194226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12271551243001673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106241232389515,0.0,0.0,0.10170869676594807,0.0,0.0,0.1201362056691762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140591159700636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13851771863842996,0.0,0.0,0.2918603207828074,0.14643839715634988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,nellythumper,2019/04/01,Freaking out at 3am Have been anxious about my health for a lot of today since I've been feeling dizzy lately. I also had really long heart palpitations twice earlier when I was active and now just had a fairly long episode of sharp neck pain on the front sides and a bit on top of my right shoulder. I'm really worried they're all related and need something to calm me down so I can sleep.

healthanxiety,aminals_42217,2019/04/01,"How to help my husband Hi there! I am a 28 YO F married to my incredible 37 YO M husband who suffers from health anxiety. It comes in waves. He has gone through some therapy but she wasn’t a LMHC so it was kind of pointless. He is on a low dose SSRI and that usually helps. Until we see someone who has MS. 
Oddly enough, my maternal grandmother had MS. He does not have any history of it in his family. He does not know his paternal grandfather and sometimes that is his excuse for why he thinks MS might run in his family. Anyway, we saw a friend who was recently diagnosed with MS over the weekend and his anxiety has been through the roof. I have severe anxiety and OCD, so sometimes I spiral once he’s spiraling, but usually I can keep my cool. 
I am trying to find a way to help him. He has no real symptoms, but has some issues that lead to similar symptoms. For example, he’s a graphic design teacher with metal screws in his wrist, so he frequently gets odd sensations in his hands from working on computers all day, but of course that’s the MS - not the likely carpal tunnel or arthritis he has going on. 
Any suggestions? He is open to therapy but I don’t know that he will stick to it since the episodes are so few and far between. What can I do to help?",2.9384064491938484,4.624235007874018,4.643678290213725,83.31266404199476,74.90551181102363,8.617622797150355,28.236970378702654,9.23628265651192,2.5073238095238093,988,41,199,24,21,334,142,254,0.086,0.8340000000000001,0.08,0.4408,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,2,0,0,2,7,7,1,0,11,1,25,8,2,2,1,32,35,17,0,0,9,2,1,1,1,2,5,0,0,0,13,11,0,1,4,1,0,5,6,3,0,0,7,4,22,4,30,26,5,25,0,2,2,1,36,12,1,4,8,128,35,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17449104679463806,0.0,0.29443773984122223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11051544621186553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08274015833570096,0.0,0.0,0.13021750646452016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22454498668928274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13256382655969826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2418916688143242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11726000997374753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991209940458428,0.0,0.06702924487965896,0.0,0.07291344295893364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13637240467313208,0.0,0.0,0.34397580246059745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13390745212648827,0.0,0.11403517566528752,0.0,0.1336003023027523,0.14101600049783145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06267883300228425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13610153810031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366308084738648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.146028674360872,0.0,0.0,0.12667659566312472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10223511858834143,0.0,0.0,0.1449377027389027,0.0,0.10612758713910612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870459001896664,0.0,0.2537755951006589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666968582694424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29343478933456657,0.0,0.0,0.08220674938767009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710440662182088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28259933145718946,0.0,0.0,0.10183521095553934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11576697775614725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09340084892769653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,discoborg,2019/04/01,"Low pulse rate - Could 1.5 weeks of exercise result in lowered atenolol dosage? I have been taking 100 mg atenolol daily for quite some time now (several years). I was prescribed it for an elevated testing heart rate of about 90 to 100. No history of heart problem, negative stress test. The atenolol seemed to be doing it's job as my resting heart rate fell to about 70 bpm. Fast forward about 1.5 weeks ago I changed my diet and started walking about 3 miles every day (90 minutes). Today I notice that my resting heart rate is 50 bpm. I would not think the exercise could improve my heart rate that quickly, but could it? Could such little time exercising be lowering my heart rate such that the atenolol can be decreased (tapered down over time)?",6.544275362318842,7.6211222681159425,5.695797101449276,81.53688405797102,65.44927536231884,8.45217391304348,34.89855072463768,8.515128840125781,2.8126463768115952,595,27,107,8,9,179,88,138,0.098,0.888,0.014,-0.8220000000000001,3,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,1,8,3,0,1,4,0,14,10,6,1,0,13,18,3,0,6,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,6,1,1,0,2,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,2,0,10,0,16,8,3,22,0,1,0,0,0,7,0,2,14,62,16,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09821433071586276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11720790869983724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35384766515688404,0.0,0.0,0.0714545172721281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933507524416944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7877656624381217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10994833888190904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11104710818597363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261424449856963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10601719917851306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784561822332433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008648887203247,0.0,0.1251684042193917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842226792550286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12691691114682313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08330511011481484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099386455334142,0.0,0.0,0.19381882970833408,0.0,0.10502203980333401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17774839089738564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07870658941635618,0.0,0.0,0.07134925421923742

healthanxiety,RainbowWolf_Bren,2019/04/01,"Sensation of throat closing So yeah been rough with HA, most notably an anaphylaxis fear. Every so often my throat just feels tight, or odd sensations in my throat make it feel hard to breathe, it feels like it’s closing which sends me into a panic. I want to know if this sensation is normal for HA. I can barely eat or be close to anything with nuts or seafood without freaking. 

Sometimes the feeling happens at random, without any cause, sometimes when I’m eating.

I have been dealing with health anxiety for about three years now - I won't get into the details, it's textbook HA story - but I would love to know from those who got a handle on this beast what their one ""ah-ha!"" realization was that set them off on the path to recovery. Like, what is the single most important thing that HA sufferers need to understand to start combating HA? 

Would love to know success stories too. Also, would love to know if and how meditation and yoga helps in recovery.

healthanxiety,shoutsmoistly,2019/04/01,"Afraid something is extremely wrong with my heart Hey guys. 

I lost my job in March due to Gastritis from unknown causes. Had an endoscopy and biopsies. It's just gastritis and they think it may be due to my gallbladder but I will be having tests for that in about a week. I have been extremely ill with that since the beginning of January. Lost almost 20 lbs. In pain all day. It's great. 
ANYWAY, throughout this time and I *think* right before (but only rarely) I have been having having issues when I stand and start doing usual activities. My heart rate soars when I stand and when I begin doing everyday things, nothing strenuous, I even get sweaty sometimes and short of breath. This scares me so I have to lay back down and then it immediately goes back to normal. 
I have a history of PVCs, the palpitation where your heart skips a beat. I saw a cardiologist and he did not see anything and said it was ""pretty good"" except he vaguely mentioned some part of the ultrasound being ""slower"" and he told me to exercise more. He didn't explain any of that. That was a year ago now. 
I realize I have been laying on the couch for about a month now, but could that cause all this? I also often have low blood pressure but I've never had this happen everyday. Could it be any of these causes or maybe since I haven't been able to eat much anymore? 
My anxiety is driving me insane. Someone please help. ;(((

Yesterday I noticed a very small amount of blood in my first cough after I stood up in spit into sink it was bright red and streaky the next cough was back to mucus only. Kinda freaked out by it I went to the doctor a couple days ago and blood tests just came back fine but I don’t know if they would tell. Any help would be greatly appreciated kinda freaking out. I also stopped by daily marijuana habit about 2 weeks ago after a year and a half.

healthanxiety,FormlessCJ,2019/04/01,"Fear of colon cancer Hello.  This might be a bit TMI but I need help here. Earlier this week a had developed a hemorrhoid on the outside of my anus. It pretty much covers the hole. I wasn’t really paying attention to my feces too much but for the past few days I have been pooping very thin, flat feces. Sometimes I have constipation too. I just did end a course of Antibiotics about 3-4 weeks back(doxycycline). I’m worried it might be cancer. There’s no blood in the stool. I’m trying to eat cleaner for now and taking a fiber supplement.

I have a lot of gas too recently. Once in a while I’ll have abdominal pain but it’s minor and not localized to one spot. Can anyone shed some light?

So I googled it and worried for days I had occipital neuralgia but it went away and then I remember the next suggested disease: multiple sclerosis.  
And now I just conviced myself all the weird symptoms I had and went to the doctor only to be told I'm completely fine must be because of MS. 

Like the times I thought I was having a heart attack because of pain in my left arm, or when I thought I had a detached retina because my eyes ""felt weird"" and I thought I saw flashing lights. When I focus on something really close to my eyes and then focus on something far and feel a little desoriented etc etc etc. It must all be neurological after all!

And now I feel all these things again and I keep thinking what if it isn't psychosomatic. On top of it, I'm going to be without insurance for a few months while I'm in between jobs and neurologists and MRIs are just waay to expensive.  
How the hell do I convince myself I'm going to be fine?",3.959442322383495,5.2357343203463245,5.340580595874716,80.97540870893816,71.59740259740259,8.72533740769035,30.038451744334093,9.168548406835145,2.54574081996435,912,38,182,19,17,306,121,231,0.13,0.813,0.057,-0.9481,1,0,2,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,11,12,2,0,14,0,18,11,6,1,6,40,38,22,0,5,8,0,5,1,0,3,5,0,0,0,9,12,0,1,10,0,1,5,4,7,0,0,13,9,27,5,24,15,9,36,1,0,3,0,2,12,1,2,20,130,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10697070644079416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13728472042304204,0.1133777109769714,0.09279127924504944,0.0,0.22068625469485048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265249685054399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15565020166147606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12351551413284065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10688183214829924,0.0,0.4037520624225511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12203335549291736,0.0,0.2317329823216545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20574638111661048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12384690169459962,0.0,0.0,0.14299992137365314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11975086931270068,0.10726108364929968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13111325037882665,0.12339790211638765,0.0,0.05895548904516651,0.12094760025628652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09632127356351892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128338751689975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09177843217889407,0.25681245625956034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07730720602070587,0.0,0.11915155867091792,0.0,0.27340147942493764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1858023266089988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12542706168054713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08017080811806904,0.07732337825732823,0.0,0.287406336848794,0.07036629985431057,0.0,0.0,0.11530970278899093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09679784408456392,0.0,0.0,0.22373303148018514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11632595877844128,0.0,0.0,0.1225508620058382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,sushimuncher3,2019/04/01,"Anaphylaxis fear This is probably the most ridiculous manifestation of my health anxiety yet. I've basically developed an anaphylaxis fear, mostly related to food, even though I've never had a food-related reaction in my life. 

You hear all these stories in the news of people randomly having anaphylaxis reactions and my scumbag brain assumes it's gonna happen to me. This has made eating pretty much anything an incredibly stressful experience. Eating is one of my favourite things to do, especially trying new food and anxiety is even affecting that now.

Does anyone have any advice? Or even some statistics that could perhaps put my mind at ease? I am worried this will turn into a full-blown eating disorder in which I only eat limited quantities of what I consider safe foods.",9.066660583941603,9.853551459854016,9.520866788321172,57.30421989051098,59.94890510948905,13.565328467153284,40.48266423357664,12.815532586354998,6.070416788321168,638,32,92,23,8,214,101,137,0.185,0.758,0.058,-0.9513,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,1,0,1,6,5,1,3,6,0,11,10,1,2,2,18,16,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,10,3,7,2,1,0,0,1,1,4,0,1,2,1,10,1,12,11,5,10,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,6,4,65,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115296170848391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0776144723775783,0.0,0.17462313202211718,0.0,0.0,0.07980456926100726,0.0,0.09392187774513136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274103687247235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911260526483886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13080650588386833,0.0,0.0998787100373712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4671469231111244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2261516558042393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11164414499117796,0.0,0.2568631041969257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5520411500386879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10092758918126007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12131822726725705,0.12863638248242784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08061563638964897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799556923121953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11524197042180255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0839010155069936,0.0,0.08802654017551928,0.1102305310333551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07733959275549873,0.08680342216035618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07912557241421411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11611446997008198,0.1230548658342032,0.0,0.0,0.11473536405485575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13073916564642066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07582500961059144,0.0,0.11213526435104153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0774889335115435,0.1241441195687552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11590777874776845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,2948673,2019/04/01,"How often does y'all's anxiety cause you to actually ""feel"" symptoms of whatever it is you're currently afraid of?  Hey, so for a grand total of 2 days I've been convinced I am developing Parkinson' Disease, and after reading up on various symptoms and whatnot, I feel like I am actually starting to feel them. This is not something I've ever worried about, but now that the idea is in my head it's all I can think of.

 I'm trying not to fixate on it as I know I always do this with different things, but idk, I just want some people to relate to lol. Knowing people are going through similar things as I am usually calms me down, at least temporarily.",6.442098901098902,5.808831407692312,7.809780219780222,72.14807692307693,65.69230769230771,10.813186813186817,36.263736263736256,10.290406445055957,3.7222197802197816,513,23,97,11,7,178,91,130,0.037000000000000005,0.85,0.113,0.8515,2,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,2,1,0,7,5,0,1,2,1,10,3,1,2,3,23,20,8,0,1,5,0,3,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,8,3,0,0,7,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,3,13,4,22,19,5,14,0,0,0,0,4,6,0,2,8,72,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.3580697570128482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15265715385411555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14034983373393048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18846857025740665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11831941929519847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916813450555442,0.0,0.0,0.16055101274359268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16595413598484665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2782954779840837,0.13106706929292447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042670983866388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188287497653032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20710907938249626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.201654572892394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08963148333414613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25438235596485514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1835141394672742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14123992872098326,0.0,0.0,0.1298571112784962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3813797076658319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2437713118184664,0.11755663809865048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12456034671497315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20206021757634515,0.0,0.10821211041130388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1863170965649396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,darksoulsduck-,2019/04/01,"I'm relapsing on my past HA, at least right now. [Long post] In October of 2017, I had my first actual panic attack and it was massive. I never figured out where it came from, but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 2-3 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then, I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 24/7, so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgs/EKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times, with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100% healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years, which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke, drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through, but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears (biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches) and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely, but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondria/health illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason, it was like a complete 180, from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.

Lately, I've just been more down than usual and I plan on seeing another therapist to try and tackle that, but I think it's partially making the hypochondriac I am come back out. Example: about two nights ago, I was getting ready to take a nap, but I was on my phone for a few, getting settled, propping myself with my right hand/arm on my side. Later, I would wake up and I started gaming a bit after, but I noticed my upper right arm and lower shoulder have sharp pains after moving it a few certain ways. I brushed it off because I figured, ""I probably put too much strain on it when I was on my side before my nap"". Well it's been a few nights now or so and while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten better, I think. Fine, whatever. But then I noticed pains in my forearm, closer to my wrist that would come and go slightly. Then I started feeling that later in my right forearm. Today I was pulling weeds and when I got back up, my shins had sharp pains for a few minutes. I was feeling off and light-headed and thought I may be dehydrated because I drank last night and didn't really do a good job keeping myself hydrated then. So I did the worst thing possible - I googled dehydration symptoms. When it becomes ""severe"" and should seek help, etc. Granted this was just all on the same page, but I didn't have to read it. I legit just wasn't sure if it was dehydration and it did more hurt than it helped. I'm feeling better after some water, but now while I'm not constantly Googling anything on the exception to see what the symptoms of dehydration were and effects it could have on the body, I'm fighting that feeling of being worried about the pains I mentioned above. If it was just the shoulder pain, or just the here and there forearm pain or the mild discomfort I feel in my fingers... basically if I just wasn't feeling pain in varying intensities and one or two areas, I could easily reason with myself.

I haven't seen my doctor in a couple months and I'm going to make an appointment in the morning and talk with her about it and see what we can do, as well as probably set up to see another therapist for what I'm assuming to be depression. But I'm feeling myself slipping again and I'm not ready to deal with even a fraction of what I dealt with before.",6.368672640031336,6.1672110775558195,6.715679347826086,78.49206974637683,65.72150411280846,9.723864081472778,33.12282119075597,9.2995712137729,2.826966490403448,3421,131,659,56,48,1110,343,851,0.152,0.7809999999999999,0.068,-0.9979,3,0,4,0,2,0,87.0,5,0,3,6,49,38,7,7,41,1,68,39,16,9,9,145,126,78,0,15,33,0,10,1,0,10,17,1,0,0,44,56,6,2,19,7,1,13,12,26,4,9,53,18,86,12,106,53,26,132,0,3,6,0,29,53,0,16,62,487,130,8,0.0,0.0,0.08730588825969057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03965309542106312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10731886463127714,0.0744428601153913,0.0,0.0,0.030419966254528738,0.1876257558427202,0.03422061389228415,0.0,0.04436310464711909,0.0,0.0,0.036811438177015085,0.0,0.0,0.2035609299000697,0.0,0.10319072125179307,0.0,0.08180644408827349,0.04940407149258798,0.07612895723420868,0.0,0.0,0.11868807987014915,0.09767367576832736,0.049688266080936336,0.0,0.04993680944229186,0.0,0.05116262203328968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15413403523566654,0.04690168753882231,0.09668093813185248,0.0,0.10714695448757038,0.04949620112731209,0.0,0.0,0.04611774709889691,0.03852845759280196,0.04540304187711832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0915722188036966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764259773812981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039620150506347325,0.0,0.04988910699757361,0.02954571712907395,0.0404635492631304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15101114629160184,0.15832840202911114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038049857310075166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07011342088074721,0.0,0.050845576665551305,0.037519908553365414,0.17888528737480106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04590895184203594,0.0950981502927884,0.0,0.15902642086146515,0.08995073812188878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04788758955994489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044390588840693135,0.03976073568576815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03646335619777825,0.050460759650580236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021854278713185186,0.0,0.0,0.03958728730708885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08957885188191378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14282177911226607,0.09508817525806997,0.1315355748617187,0.03316894428849335,0.06900167712576713,0.0,0.04757404093427545,0.12593663871056734,0.0,0.0,0.10185760817603673,0.0,0.0,0.12124892328410225,0.0,0.3807924308329862,0.05248452394234721,0.0,0.0,0.042702699327825,0.031012221934604168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08457426654404518,0.050429723469351005,0.04284183780482287,0.0,0.09645945534285214,0.0,0.0,0.04496900894681676,0.0,0.0,0.08949018810224857,0.0,0.02865709799506188,0.0919859252411456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528069116260415,0.0,0.0,0.04478552539073343,0.0,0.14258560147881044,0.04072323283078652,0.0,0.10107108891415788,0.0,0.07400718097005242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06332447923883049,0.0,0.07144764507019431,0.03739878153800424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042160312427447416,0.13948410954792734,0.03363364039003119,0.07190936367344912,0.0,0.0,0.10231214212346122,0.15581534291886262,0.08915582994814703,0.05732618580048018,0.0,0.035512996279940034,0.13042082713057765,0.0,0.04240164276722688,0.04274428766343613,0.0,0.06074152591164269,0.04865664627091736,0.174790519888927,0.0,0.05380827754129964,0.0,0.0492670671899726,0.0,0.0,0.07101392851258923,0.07176421051613477,0.0,0.08044065805897484,0.041467928656887885,0.040364564502561005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1817140855376392,0.04558673709994643,0.22243922188866425,0.0,0.0,0.028806578074254074

healthanxiety,bitchboynaughty,2019/04/02,"Does anyone get anxious that they’re just making it all up? How do you cope? I’m experiencing some legit health problems in my life right now, but I can’t shake the feeling of “I’m just a faker, what if I have a somatic disorder, what if I have Munchausens, I’m an attention seeker, etc etc.” which is fucked up, because I would give anything to feel better right now! Obviously I don’t have Munchausens, because I wish that I was not sick. 


It’s sort of ironic, having a legitimate health issue, and being so anxious that you convince yourself you are faking it and get scared that you have a mental disorder that makes people fake health issues.

Does anyone else experience this self doubt when experiencing actual illness/health issues?

healthanxiety,stormyros3,2019/04/02,"Tired of dealing with this I’m 17 yr female I’m pretty slim and small, and I’ve noticed I’ve had a fast heart rate for a long while now but lately it’s gotten bad. Three months ago, all of a sudden felt dizzy, my heart was racing so I went to the doctor and they took blood work which came out normal and sent me to a cardiologist. I’m guessing it was my first panic attack? My ekg was normal, he said he heard a heart murmur but thought I was okay and i had anxiety. He didn’t even feel the need to check my heart. But I still did a 48 hour heart monitor, didn’t really feel any symptoms, but  it was still normal, he just said I had sinus tachycardia. This was a about a month or 2 ago and it feels like now everything has gotten worse. My heart rate is always 100+ and when I’m walking or stand up it’s 140+ sometimes. I was also walking to class upstairs and I was gasping for air and my heart was racing.  The highest my heart I’ve seen my heart go is 195 which doesn’t sound healthy. My heart rate will also go from 50 to 100 randomly which concerns me? Yesterday morning I woke up with my heart rate at 170 so I went to the ER and my ekg was normal. My parents think I’m fine and the doctors say I’m young, it won’t hurt me and I’ll grow out of it. I have anxiety and panic attacks now because I’m always worried about my heart. I feel like i have no answers and like I’m running out of time :( ",0.13556255625562486,2.167569108910893,2.166486648664865,95.88377137713772,85.63366336633662,4.86084608460846,18.752775277527753,6.11248444174946,-0.254090429042904,1092,29,253,9,33,364,145,303,0.157,0.779,0.064,-0.9844,1,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,1,2,14,11,2,2,13,1,24,18,13,0,1,43,55,26,0,5,7,1,5,3,0,2,5,5,0,0,12,20,0,0,8,0,1,11,5,6,1,2,30,11,29,5,23,23,1,40,0,1,1,0,12,8,0,4,23,138,41,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10394382097922616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09377269487181776,0.09756962530730408,0.0,0.0,0.039870374468612704,0.0,0.08970349796019629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334000576198294,0.0,0.0,0.04895355677300999,0.035740271509555194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0670570401753707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060444900927793026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12002047024235535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03872452704330366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05269281588551932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11858025135012742,0.08377049170756788,0.05629394352638952,0.0,0.0,0.04987060296965736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06664150001896484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06458749662251229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.833721233889389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0577386876945278,0.0,0.06276457088015297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06613713396015944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08593089177800173,0.0,0.0,0.05188565812084734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935957286709974,0.0,0.0,0.043473362805387834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22977959898615494,0.0,0.06675058325962507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13757922056055685,0.06510161776043064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05964773394850851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037559845355737316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11154101144530586,0.04662488709057326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05798651674986241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09364390282402396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06093896394191354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037567702666043284,0.0,0.046545628891776485,0.034187593587012614,0.06738649926636303,0.0,0.0,0.06514002839588963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870109652023012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042683299697506505,0.05954155714693307,0.05974892489259341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,whatsathroeaway,2019/04/02,"Anybody feel their anxiety is subconscious? I don’t get panic attacks. I get scary physical manifestations of anxiety instead like feeling dizzy, faint, feeling like my heart is beating too slow. This is how I know I’m feeling anxious if I’m experiencing these symptoms, because I rarely get normal “panic” like others do. Also, when I’m very anxious I noticed I yawn almost constantly. Does anyone else experience this, or feel like their anxiety is always there even if you don’t *feel* panicy?

healthanxiety,GlobalPrune,2019/04/02,"How to get doctor to order imaging of chest and abdomen (and head as a bonus)? I visited a new PCP a few weeks ago -- it was my first doctor's visit in a few years and first since moving to a new city. They don't have any of my old medical records. I told him that I have a family history of a few different types of cancer (lung, pancreatic, brain). I mentioned having a persistent cough, but all he recommended was prilosec in case the cough is GERD. I'd really like to get some imaging done of my lungs and abdomen (I've had very minor pain in my left side around my ribs for YEARS) to rule anything out.

healthanxiety,PonderingPotato,2019/04/02,"Concussion anxiety taking over my life Let me just preface this by saying I've been essentially the hugest hypochondriac my entire life, even to the point of freaking out over a bat *maybe* biting me after it flew over my head once. I've never been this anxious about anything because getting a life threatening TBI is my hugest fear and it's basically consumed me.

Almost two full days ago, I slammed my head four times within two or so hours against a few different walls. Not ruthlessly hard, but *just* hard enough to worry. I matched basically no concussion symptoms at the time but it hasn't stopped me from flipping out excessively. Since I woke up yesterday though, I've gotten minor potential symptoms that made it so I couldn't function in my normal life without freaking out, which has worried me. While I didn't get a headache, I had minor, non-painful, yet strange feeling head pressure, (especially when moving it,) slight sensitivity to light, occasionally feeling dazed, me not being able to remember or place words in sentences, etc. It became rough trying to figure out which 'symptoms' were from me freaking myself out, and which could be potentially real. I even stopped drinking coffee because I'm so freaked out caffeine could make my 'concussion' worse.

The worst part came last night, when I dozed off while hanging out with friends watching a movie around 8. *I couldn't sleep.* I kept jerking myself awake and my body refused to do anything, heart racing, and it got to the point I kept taking 20 hour power naps until midnight where I'd wake up in a total daze with some of the worst anxiety I've had in my life. So, reasonably, I Googled symptoms to subdermal hematomas, which freaked me out even *more,* because now I'm convinced I have a brain bleed. I woke up this morning and I still feel dazed, still shaking, even though the only remaining concussion symptom is me feeling pretty dumb and detached from the world. Even *after* friends who've had real concussions reassured me, nothing's helped, in fact me Googling shit made it worse (like always.) 

I guess my rant results to me asking whether or not I'm justified being like this. I've been honest to God debating on just driving to an ER or something immediately despite potential freakout and the fact I'm only 18 because almost nothing else has entered my mind. The anxiety has been consuming me, and I'm 100% convinced I'm dying, and it's the *worst.*",6.162450842696629,7.837210584269665,5.9026509831460725,77.51206636235956,66.75280898876404,8.438904494382022,35.254564606741575,8.841846274778883,3.20021488764045,1950,95,328,32,32,606,233,445,0.182,0.718,0.101,-0.9905,2,0,2,0,0,0,63.0,0,0,0,1,23,25,3,3,19,0,25,21,9,5,4,68,52,27,1,5,14,0,7,2,2,0,11,1,0,0,18,21,1,5,7,2,0,7,10,17,1,3,19,10,42,8,49,25,11,61,0,0,1,0,7,31,2,8,25,211,60,0,0.0743358996232246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06589428984445866,0.0,0.14887333134841202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06185342341128346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17060027923638638,0.0839784077016454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12234422312156383,0.06617471079059309,0.06949403153888327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812578977977695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825704266524074,0.0,0.08298344833755374,0.0,0.08502046585935083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11870233416388172,0.0,0.0,0.047940505601439865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07714892768391284,0.07766519351654523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728208816582066,0.0,0.0,0.062098105560902776,0.0,0.0,0.07680885554930544,0.08290417788753777,0.2454908031128669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364855368640453,0.15034585757349994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11486346330146302,0.0,0.07767487890404581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05945320964235783,0.0,0.08188937413840881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331807300074126,0.0,0.2288702367629668,0.0,0.0,0.08808839896692322,0.0498257865839336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464117746043712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0605936796732859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601349377603513,0.2625282213880497,0.07263353140916526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406768511807093,0.049619790226222926,0.0,0.07468040259553217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750580678365139,0.0,0.0,0.07900729709373035,0.0,0.0,0.05733242845227982,0.0,0.0,0.06975920614445448,0.07283339862483616,0.14265460107756708,0.0,0.0,0.07916530703742072,0.0,0.11307160273477837,0.07909863826972591,0.0,0.0,0.08049853531141582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07766519351654523,0.0,0.14054290526019173,0.0,0.0,0.07562633415513369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16922105594152687,0.0,0.07642968543927416,0.0,0.0,0.08420808335552063,0.0,0.0,0.0591148910049288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630473272765859,0.06149142433432244,0.0,0.07438958412091813,0.0,0.0,0.057227407253426586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11872949092540652,0.12429628125252523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3863173120807243,0.11178269059962267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14606928791168175,0.0,0.08669172172754339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05046919630756496,0.0,0.14523074500643582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716571545540244,0.0,0.0,0.15098342883564125,0.15150926481927954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,acanpio,2019/04/02,"Hello, I could use advice...I am suffering from rather severe health anxiety. (At least I think I am?) Hello, I just want to say I'm really sorry if I break any of the rules! I am a bit confused as to what is allowed ;; I don't know if there is a point to this, I am just...confused and scared.

I am 15, and for the past years I have experienced extreme fatigue, to the point where I sleep ~15+ hours a day when I can. But how do I know if this is real? I could just have a bad lifestyle. I try my best to stay healthy and do everything the doctor says, but it doesn't go away. 

I also believe I could be ""faking"" it? I experience a lot of weakness and like...memory problems. I also get chronic pain in my thigh which is really painful. But the thing is...there is nothing that could cause this? I don't think there is. It is incredibly random - am I making this up to seem like something is wrong? 

I have previously been diagnosed with depression and GAD, but I got those treated. But I am still worrying about this? I am on medications that have helped, so why am I still anxious over my health? They worked for everything else :( I think it is something in my mind because I keep getting ""Dreams"" that make me feel no one can be trusted, or that I will be yelled at or do something wrong. 

How do I even know if I'm suffering from health anxiety? What if I am just exaggerating everything? Maybe I am just a person who is afraid to grow up, or that I am immature...

I am really sorry if this broke any rules, or didn't make sense. I guess it was just an outlet! I have been scared for a while now. Thank you for reading, if you have any advice on something I could maybe do to help calm my nerves, I would appreciate it very much :(",2.1325118035882897,3.754958535410765,3.7740708215297474,88.96208829084044,76.96033994334276,7.199584513692162,23.381397544853634,8.021203637495839,1.081310179414542,1325,41,294,22,30,442,167,353,0.21600000000000005,0.713,0.071,-0.9942,1,0,4,0,0,0,66.0,0,2,1,2,20,23,0,4,13,0,53,13,2,8,0,59,75,29,0,16,22,0,1,1,0,2,11,3,0,1,23,6,0,1,8,2,0,2,5,17,0,1,5,5,47,6,29,60,5,26,0,5,0,0,11,13,0,16,10,212,70,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08263237843787268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352473717348332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17251386550214434,0.0,0.1293784118193631,0.09553026288283342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07944817758145417,0.0,0.07060520015631283,0.05154781776682641,0.0,0.0,0.09527169097034452,0.08874192613424539,0.0,0.09231909958747762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686780614216856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33757680985595123,0.0,0.0,0.054535079054038385,0.0,0.07283257204118025,0.08582799636966877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08655213106995706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706401622883206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055851978141830336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22799488276088,0.08271723225110768,0.0,0.0,0.04275676239411502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835963677065957,0.0,0.048058167350059834,0.0,0.06763144124547826,0.0,0.09315386720055206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26965430158342835,0.0,0.0,0.11335938894240002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08327590210324798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07516201860063702,0.0,0.0,0.13941812941362197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262481439607178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718910409554886,0.0,0.0,0.16933608534265826,0.0,0.16990649590530973,0.0,0.0,0.08518666989613682,0.0,0.0,0.08538286385917304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062162326437666525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08113890174485118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05730096331221118,0.0,0.17995848967336428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08072338264918562,0.0,0.07383571440337489,0.0,0.0,0.1598756281915096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08091379746180392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845842395356293,0.09624933600097292,0.1625165099736388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344931687215176,0.16932133847123387,0.0,0.0,0.07698148262888499,0.0,0.09553026288283342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08462242523177446,0.0,0.0,0.2603978526692497,0.0,0.1893190298747217,0.0,0.0901311542834166,0.13506161631862948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07785273545755568,0.0,0.0,0.05617880750394368,0.16255050752172806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057411609992368814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07303386124487475,0.0,0.06977197470782097,0.0498764786967161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630347114110472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06156167431200595,0.08587616175614735,0.0,0.060069961141127025,0.1849091363133215,0.0,0.05445474083148767
healthanxiety,QueenRenny,2019/04/02,"Chest pains earlier today. Scared to go to sleep. Hi all. I'm new to this subreddit and so glad I found it. Ever since I got pregnant (currently 13 weeks), I've been experiencing a ton of health anxiety. This is new for me, so it's especially terrifying. Earlier today I had chest pains and got in the car and drove to the ER. Once I got to the parking lot, I calmed down and felt better. I didn't even go inside. My chest seemed to relax and I was okay enough to drive home and listen to a podcast to calm down. I've had panic attacks for as long as I can remember (not specifically related to my health until now), and this just felt different than a normal panic attack. I've never had chest pain with my panic attacks. A few minutes ago I started getting the chest pain again. It's been hours since it last happened. Does this sound like anxiety? Would chest pains related to a heart attack come and go throughout the day? I'm currently afraid to go to sleep due to the chest pain...im worried ill die in my sleep and not wake up if I'm experiencing pain.

healthanxiety,just_a_scared_guy,2019/04/03,"I'm a lot scared about my mom's lower leg pain Hi! First of all, I made a second account to talk about these personal issues, I use my personal account (which has my real name) for a lot of public things and didn't feel comfortable in sharing those personal issues there.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom had breast cancer six years ago, and treated it successfully, doing chemo and radiotherapy. Fortunately, it was diagnosed very early. She is totally cured now, and constantly monitors her breast and

 thyroid (which she had some benign cysts). She is 60 and doesn't smoke or drink at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, she removed a dot on her face. The biopsy returned Basal Cell Carcinoma, but with no spread on close lymphs. The dermatologist said it was nothing to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday she said she had been felling pain around the tibia for about a year and half. It's a pain she feels deep, that comes for some time (like a week), then disappear for some months, then comes back. It doesn't seem to be affected by exercise, but hurts at night. While she was pressing the region to show me where it was, she said she could feel it hurt a little, even if, at that moment, it wasn't hurting the way it used to. There is no swelling at all, and she said it never was. She also said the pain is the same since it begun. 

&amp;#x200B;

And she had been having some cramps a while ago, the doctors said it could be a neuropaty caused by the medications she took, like tamoxifen. She also said these cramps usually stops when this pain begins.

&amp;#x200B;

She said she's worried about it being a bone metastasis from the breast cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I know, it's extremely unlikely that a metastasis from a cancer she treated back in 2013 (and which, in that time, had no secondary tumor detected) could only appear now. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm extremely worried about other cancer possibilities. Like a primary bone cancer, or a secondary cancer from a hidden tumor that originated in other part of the body.

&amp;#x200B;

The rational part of me says it's probably neuropaty, or even some other symptom caused maybe by her age, and if that pain was bone cancer, she probably would be gone now, or at least the pain would have gotten worse after all this time, or even some swelling would have appeared.

&amp;#x200B;

But the other part (the same that worried about me having ALS because of some twitches) says it could be cancer. She has an appointment with the same doctor that treated her cancer on Monday, but, until then, I can't help but be terrified about this possibility.

healthanxiety,drinkingindramnesic,2019/04/03,One tonsil swollen? Has this happened to anyone else? I'm just now getting over a bout of a really bad sore throat I had for a couple of weeks. I had significant post nasal drip at the time too. I went to the doctor and she said it wasn't strep and she figured it was just an upper respiratory infection and that it just looked like swelling from irritation. My sore throat is mostly gone but the tonsil in question still appears to be swollen or have a lump behind it. I know that it's probably just because of the illness but I'm worried and I don't have health insurance and it's very hard to see a doctor without it here. I don't want to go back and them tell me it's nothing. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm 24 F and i used to be a smoker but I've quit for about 7 months now,0.4791679798298141,2.6975741497006034,2.46424204223133,93.05021115663412,85.94610778443113,5.192436180271037,20.765521588402144,6.5966054737557815,0.2568155688622751,621,20,138,7,19,207,98,167,0.121,0.8590000000000001,0.02,-0.9251,0,0,1,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,1,1,11,2,0,0,11,0,13,13,3,1,0,23,29,11,0,1,9,0,1,1,0,0,10,1,0,0,12,7,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,1,0,1,7,5,12,1,19,20,1,16,0,0,2,0,6,4,0,4,8,90,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2258610473682552,0.33096916280915456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12419009491468212,0.1348528814065403,0.09845410452326676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17870612322550095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3306216607507676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26983931513588194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08438154408017327,0.0,0.09178902301707924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28564293012192704,0.0,0.1446799248136941,0.0,0.0,0.17167602136805798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08876086761368601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07890491261495734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356264933387433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12891457261372627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15497179627323854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10944236391816588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1546805324768844,0.0,0.17413351853433998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18092652336886564,0.17178420859439458,0.0,0.0,0.10346650387204964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15363160288990915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870139267109354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1289809255385513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14116557930641074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09417692620255627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394915191418267,0.0,0.1332614568040801,0.09526191911889537,0.0,0.1295524055946233,0.0,0.0,0.14972003102627854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15568846533071984,0.0,0.0,0.1640197581950369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ZiggyandNico,2019/04/03,"Scared my doc won't take me seriously Hi all, I'm a new here, I've had health anxiety for about 6 years, it comes and goes a couple of times a year for me but when I have an episode it's BAD, I'm talking like exacerbating my own physical symptoms by worrying, googling for hours until I'm convinced I'm going to die, hell even obsessing over my pets health and running them to the vets for every tiny thing, although that mostly started after my old kitty died of lymphoma.

Anyway so I'm really worried about going to the doctor next week that she's not going to take me seriously if I tell her I have health anxiety.  I think that I have PGAD, although granted my anxiety does seem to be making it way worse, I do have actual symptoms and reason to believe it.  I'm actually just kind of hoping it's all in my head but at the same time I'm worried that if I don't get tested and assessed for it it will turn out to be real and not just my anxiety 😭 I hate that feeling of uncertainty 😭",3.76112343966713,4.451923475728158,5.671872399445218,80.60582524271845,71.52427184466019,8.604160887656034,28.79195561719833,8.841846274778883,2.1704712898751723,780,29,161,14,14,271,119,206,0.25,0.675,0.075,-0.9925,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,0,9,11,2,2,7,0,11,7,1,2,2,26,33,14,2,3,8,0,1,1,0,2,6,0,1,0,13,7,0,0,4,0,0,5,4,7,0,0,1,1,21,4,25,28,5,23,1,0,0,0,6,4,1,5,14,102,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.22295225101888075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3495554790457509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09538080664577812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870285354536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098402670196191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12639799764012624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371141814227259,0.0,0.0,0.11692357021985585,0.09996714046213236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07545062851087801,0.0,0.09624726178483502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057760256718823726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05968266792994805,0.0,0.19476582847800325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11278264760197786,0.1172372718396025,0.3642769193145854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11346036122478427,0.11249770129080874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11895736692232313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055809072338918936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625223250064428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11032812673395316,0.12148939467646715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11986960329671233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13002355756472586,0.07318136992848852,0.1174518093989585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11436838795141588,0.0,0.0,0.10399454847058467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08085557270146991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2374661993974791,0.17177984175848934,0.09181714326439656,0.09984574808062648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589214341523183,0.07319667906319602,0.0,0.0,0.1332217909610655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12425403405624665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067381096038664,0.0916318051170458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3480312028778649,0.1164144349898514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14712619168829572

healthanxiety,Vag7,2019/04/03,"I'm Sacred But I Think I'm Also Broken. Every Few Months my pee starts to smell sweet and I have to urinate more frequently and I get tired, for example I've urinated 3 times in the past hour today which isn't normal for me usually I urinate 3-4 times a day, at first I thought it was Diabetes or something else but I've had many blood tests etc done and they all came back normal. 

Last time this happen it lasted from July 2018 - November 2018, I had numerous tests and numerous Doctors say it was a Viral Infection.

It seems to happen every few months, I consume a normal amount of Sugar, I only drink water I drink about 1-2 litres a day, I walk alot.

The Doctors can't figure out the issue, posting here just incase someone has had the same issues as me.

healthanxiety,modernjaneausten,2019/04/03,"Recurring chest pain with no other symptoms I’ve had a lot of intense stress the past year and also suffer from an anxiety disorder, so it seems to be affecting my body a lot. I went to the ER back in February because my chest hurt and I had a lot of coughing, and they did a chest x-ray and CT scan and monitored my heart rate, and everything came back clean for heart issues with reassurance from the radiologist that I’m very low risk for heart issues. I was diagnosed with pleurisy which was verified by my regular doctor, and got better after a couple weeks. The chest pain has seemed to linger though and my stress has not improved. I have no other symptoms with this chest pain other than anxiety that it’s something bad. I’m afraid to waste more money going to the hospital again since they ran tests that came back clean. Could this be something I need to have checked out again?

healthanxiety,ritemr,2019/04/04,"[Trigger warning] I'm 17, I have MS, and I'm worried I also have colon cancer. It's been quite the rough year and I'll admit my HA wasn't as bad as it was after my family got the results from my first MRI test. Sure, I googled symptoms all the time, especially because one of my ""enflamed lesions"" was causing me chronic nausea for more than a month, leading me to finally start on my google journey again and begin to go down the rabbit hole of different problems I could possibly have. Until I got double vision, I was almost convinced I had esophagus cancer. 

It was crazy. I googled stuff all the time, cried over things I might have, worried about it till I fell asleep. But I never really expected the new thing called ""MS"" i saw in passing was actually going to end up being me. It was crazy. Every single part. And as you can already expect, it's fueling even more, even worse anxiety as I try to figure out some current bowel problems that have been plaguing me since my diagnosis last year. Today I made it a job for me to find out what is going on. I've made my way up to taking 290 mg of Linzess a day and still deal with constipation unless I decide to have a fun day out. I always have to go to the bathroom anyway, throughout the day, whether or not I actually end up going. I started having lower right, dull pain halfway into my newfound constipation and was told the linzess would help. It didn't. Then we decided to try more. It helped for a week. I'm vaguely aware or trying to convince myself that drinking more water should help, because I'm supposed to with linzess or i risk becoming dehydrated, but its been hard to keep up with. 

TMI but, because I'm nervous and desire opinions, I must go on. My stools are pale and light a lot of the time. Yellow or white mucus covers some of it and half of it floats, half doesn't... Most times I go I bleed a little after, and this past time, quite a lot. A bright red glop of blood which just didn't seem right for what could've been a hemorrhoid or something else.  I usually always feel some kind of discomfort or dull pain in my abdomen, across the lower side usually, and  recently I even had a blood test taken that said my blood count was low. This may be because, for MS reasons, I'm trying to cut down on red meats and aren't getting enough iron... But it doesn't seem right. At all. All these symptoms line up. down to the anemia. I'm worried beyond compare of anything else before. Nothing from anyone helps, because they're just repeating their words before my MRI. I'm scared. I already panicked and cried, and called mom, and I'm going to tell my neurologist tomorrow to see what she has to offer in guidance. I can only hope I'm not this unlucky... getting two incredibly rare health problems for my age and form and everything else in the same damn year, even. 

I just don't even know where to start at dealing with this.",3.8079008119726163,5.325397406304732,4.7429402165260335,84.1719998805923,72.30998248686515,7.1523801942365886,27.51317465371756,7.686295010490155,1.6091782837127844,2273,83,440,28,44,739,282,571,0.138,0.8109999999999999,0.051,-0.9928,6,0,2,0,0,0,76.0,1,1,1,4,15,23,2,4,24,1,42,20,7,7,7,89,83,37,0,11,17,1,3,0,0,5,11,1,0,0,28,26,2,1,10,1,0,12,10,15,0,5,25,12,51,8,76,50,20,85,0,3,7,0,18,32,1,19,40,291,79,4,0.0,0.0,0.13109803278680884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06726185862904514,0.0,0.14824930774496012,0.053716468669426164,0.11178298177463593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05138548214172072,0.0,0.0,0.046967388811578636,0.0,0.055275849375763686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056084816635565485,0.20473349703814375,0.07418487702767577,0.11431481576396516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13717780455974452,0.0,0.0,0.06900292001483364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10726084446626916,0.0,0.14756795088090985,0.12995883740207806,0.13850030145140574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07017919488187795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06580181692681608,0.0,0.0,0.16833776578535,0.0,0.11898679215425992,0.06940539768436155,0.0,0.2218284167372404,0.0,0.05659430045422744,0.0,0.060368788536736474,0.0,0.06332265711653827,0.0,0.03396357737808887,0.0,0.0,0.07358233383978494,0.061392899072923925,0.0571354526092455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07018794671350463,0.0,0.3053977324845454,0.0,0.10744525821480948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06017184778989745,0.0,0.0,0.07139942490456849,0.0,0.0,0.18009269936715305,0.0,0.0,0.06671576576542528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0666566595594656,0.05970449799509259,0.0,0.06994805711871685,0.03691531788275045,0.05475317142544316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06732279323806613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11421243310130337,0.0,0.12711728004999762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07125760942825038,0.0,0.07866963524922015,0.0536150958828713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05180626593747845,0.0648739822530436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06445219921898722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045516676013831685,0.051086424205199606,0.14294894530430036,0.0,0.0,0.07273943631032212,0.06412213412126944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07572499029102843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1928201669516892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428888391469711,0.0,0.0,0.04303133783321216,0.06906277505200308,0.06632306661229992,0.0,0.0,0.17209050193855266,0.06389481772757045,0.0,0.06724969407085946,0.0,0.05352643512999579,0.1222995566336896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05556438420517604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05171136753000228,0.0,0.0,0.1426315249911854,0.0,0.0536426918198897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07689450150703958,0.0,0.0,0.06330768898971849,0.139632371739244,0.05050408601853534,0.0,0.058710244438792115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08925059657611352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1958391834968749,0.0,0.06367006927617469,0.06418458293307558,0.0,0.18241827015834672,0.0,0.06561611640403442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1479583042685335,0.0,0.0,0.0533170586431218,0.05388036827011738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2046456397601072,0.06845278908560977,0.0477162128065213,0.0,0.0,0.1297673888485462
healthanxiety,purhitta,2019/04/04,"Hypertensive at 25 &amp; fear of death Hi all! Having an HA episode today and I don't know how to cope. 

Went to my psychiatrist this morning where he took my blood pressure. He had to take it about three times- the numbers were in the 160/110 range. I was very nervous at this appt- my first time with a psychiatrist- but I've had high BP before at other doctor visits in the past month (ie i just got a CPAP machine last month- sleep doc said BP might come down with that treatment. and gyno reduced my birth control last month in an attempt to bring it down as well.) 

But today I took my BP again at CVS about 30 mins later and it was still high, so I went to urgent care. They said it was probably stress related though I can take other measures to reduce it- mostly, exercise more, lose weight, and reduce salt intake. They released me with no meds and an order to monitor it at home for white coat syndrome. 

Suddenly I'm terrified. I can make those lifestyle changes without issue. But what if they don't help? What if I go into cardiac arrest or stroke before I can lower it? Will exercise make it worse? Will I die in my sleep? Will I have to go on hypertension meds at 25? It runs in my family but this feels like a personal failing- my lifestyle and eating habits haven't helped, I'm sure. Am I fucked for life? Am I going to die young?

Im home now and just took it again; 160/90. I'm so scared. 

I have depression and GED which also don't help. I've been stressed out lately but I didn't think it was a huge problem. I feel like I'm just waiting to stroke out or go into extreme chest pain. I feel helpless.

healthanxiety,denilee_1,2019/04/04,"Any of you severely nearsighted with anxiety over future eye problems? I am severely myopic which I know is a risk factor for retinal detachment. My mom had a retinal detachment which is when a huge fear kicked in. My number one fear is going blind. I wish I never found out about the risks...I just always went about my life knowing I had bad eyes but it’s all I ever knew and never had concerns. I can’t seem to turn the fear off now- seriously making myself ill. Was wondering if anyone else experienced anything like this, or is currently!

healthanxiety,pinkdrink96,2019/04/04,"It finally got the best of me I have suffered with health anxiety over the past year but it’s been increasingly worse the past few months. This along with the stress I have been under lately has been a disastrous combination. My heart rate has been higher than usual lately along with this weird pain in chest and shoulder,obviously leading me to constantly believe I’m having a heart attack. Also I’ve been somewhat struggling with more intense allergy symptoms. 
I don’t have health insurance so I’ve been trying to just ignore it and chalk it up to stress but of course my mind wonders and then I go to google. The past month alone I’ve convinced myself that I have various heart issues, brain tumors, ALS and so many more. 
So, long story short, yesterday it got the best of me and I had a panic attack and went to urgent care. The nurse practitioner has pretty much decided it’s all stress related but decided to do an EKG and a few blood tests anyway. The EKG came back fine and he says by the look of things I seem pretty healthy. Unfortunately the blood test result won’t be in until Saturday so that’s weighing on me because I’m obviously thinking the worst but he prescribed me some anxiety meds and they have helped slightly. 
But it still sucks to be such a prisoner in my own mind.

healthanxiety,Boomboxbilly,2019/04/04,Food went down the wrong hole. I’m panicking right now. A few hours ago I was eating a sandwich and I think I swallowed some through my wind pipe. I choked for a few seconds and drank some water and thought I was okay but I’m feeling some discomfort in my chest an it feels like something is stuck in my upper chest. I googled and it said that it could get infected or cause pneumonia.

healthanxiety,drkphntm,2019/04/04,"The dread of thinking you have cancer... again My health anxiety has been okay for the last year or so but it's become out of control in the last few days. My poor husband keeps trying to reassure me but I'm struggling to keep myself together 😔

Firstly, I've had two cold sores in the last month. That's kind of strange as usually I have an outbreak once a year, maybe twice.

Then about a week ago I developed a really sudden intense pain on the left side underneath my rib towards the back. I've never had a pain like that before and wasn't sure why it was happening. Luckily it went away after a few hours.

I've also been waking up a few nights lately sweating a little (that always starts alarm bells in my mind but I told myself it's probably because I was due for my period)

Then last night, I woke up with a really sore throat. I instantly got kind of nervous - especially combined with the two cold sores recently. I've felt kinda warm all day but in the last few hours, I feel like I'm freezing and think I might be getting a fever - which never happens to me during a cold 😖😖😖

So ofc now I'm freaking out wondering if my immune system is destroyed because of Leukemia or Lymphoma. I'm trying to be calm but it's really difficult atm 😔😔 I'm hoping all this has been influenced by how stressed I've been for the last year but I'm still really scared. Any words of advice/support would be incredibly appreciated rn.

healthanxiety,adiraofthesea,2019/04/04,"Okay, I can't live like this. How do I get help? I've had health anxiety since I can remember, I was like probably 6 or 7 when I had my first flare up but this last year it is off the charts. I actually have had some health scares and I think it's triggering it beyond belief. I think it's actually causing the aches and pains. I'm at the point where I'm 500% sure I have colon cancer and ALS and cervix/ovarian cancer and an undiagnosed heart issue. Now my kidneys hurt? So naturally my cancer has spread. It's been like this for a year, and my only relief has been when seasonal depression hits.

I'm getting married soon. I have a good job. I have lots to look forward to but I'm so so sure I won't be around to see it. I need help and no one takes me seriously. My doctor doesn't understand that this iya ruining my life and keeps giving me meds. With side effects. To someone with health anxiety. I've taken like six different types and none help at all.

There has to be something. I can do.

healthanxiety,justice_warwick_89,2019/04/04,"Convinced I have MRI contrast dye poisoning weeks after a brain MRI. Need help coping. Using a somewhat new throwaway account, sorry if my karma is low. I'm sort of new to the realization that I have HA, but it all makes sense now. I've always had anxiety, but it's definitely evolved into this about 6 months ago.

A few months back, I had some strange symptoms that were related to jaw pain. I've pretty much figured out what's wrong there, but because of that, I've seen a slew of doctors including a neurologist. My doctor ordered a brain MRI with contrast just to be safe. I stupidly googled if the contrast dye can cause adverse reactions in people (I strongly suggest you don't google it.) Anyway, after the MRI, I felt nauseated, which set my HA into a tailspin. 

Now, a few weeks later, I'm noticing that my feet, hands, and legs suddenly go cold, especially when I'm sitting down. I'm talking freezing cold, even if the rest of my body is warm. When they finally warm up, I get pins and needles all down my legs and today, I woke up with muscle spasms in my feet and legs. My scumbag brain is telling me I have some type of weird contrast dye poisoning that isn't curable, you know how it goes.

My feet getting freezing cold does happen when I'm not in what I would say would be a heightened state of anxiety. It usually sends me into a state of anxiety which I'm sure definitely doesn't help my extremities. It's a real chicken/egg scenario.

Does this sound like anxiety to anyone or should I actually be concerned? I mean, I'm young (just turned 30,) I exercise about 4 or 5 times a week, I eat pretty healthy, and am all around healthy. In my mind, this should not be happening, but, here I am. I'm also worried that if I go to the doctor and ask him to test to see if I still have the dye in my system, he's going to think I'm crying wolf and won't take me seriously when something else is wrong.

I definitely need the sage advice of other HA veterans. I'm new to this and don't know how to tell my brain to stop worrying about it. It won't, and I feel out of control, like I can't shut it off.",4.373173302107727,4.952241920374712,5.584197892271664,82.18856850117099,70.07728337236534,8.535597189695551,30.706674473067913,8.634040054169528,2.2616618266978925,1648,66,339,26,28,551,207,427,0.142,0.713,0.146,0.5984,0,0,1,0,0,0,57.0,0,2,1,2,21,21,3,0,19,3,29,26,13,6,4,63,62,27,0,11,15,0,7,2,0,6,12,2,0,0,24,17,1,3,7,1,1,4,9,10,0,0,6,14,40,11,43,46,10,55,1,1,2,0,14,18,0,11,29,204,64,5,0.0,0.0,0.08686403908590759,0.0,0.0,0.0869826650291165,0.07890482759391966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07118382076176298,0.07406610985384891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723794055073424,0.0,0.0,0.0622400963731699,0.0,0.0,0.07924061642267385,0.08321532245548774,0.0,0.0,0.06844565334437858,0.0,0.05426161815207741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887359427870801,0.0,0.3974726611170391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914410722082684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998358683720892,0.0,0.0,0.09777681617840746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2733263340619418,0.15579209551328926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108272177929172,0.07435910341788297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0587923765207482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04500774649555855,0.0,0.08546662738941163,0.09750960539713777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09301144215636054,0.0,0.15176475196099035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15742815068165789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11932733805666265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09783864936098688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08697470276872085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05941699959569152,0.0,0.0,0.09696146566575832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08987795325137571,0.0,0.14209896778353573,0.0,0.06543494112327214,0.1320043140523997,0.0,0.2579084984097735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10134211373559046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09471631654759224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06171054236927238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811168425111359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10131650463071247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07078686626697918,0.0,0.0,0.07093199271452512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06852670714924447,0.0,0.0996429854164934,0.0,0.0,0.07108605338866758,0.07441901768686117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08389388389655099,0.09251879329219116,0.0669268456384269,0.07154543526541478,0.15560291361404993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057036061865692066,0.0,0.0,0.051904310471198666,0.0,0.08437410186317575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09682079657432546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07687882169847246,0.09803545981476926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21420305015512794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807944428862671,0.0,0.1264648411924669,0.1946439128199316,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,tea-flower,2019/04/04,"Constant headache: how worried should I be? Every day I have some kind of headache. I wake up, do my thing, go to work, and there it is. Some days it comes with nausea. I've been with this for 3 weeks now.

1. Most of the time it's not a full blown migraine. Those, I take sumatriptan for (and then I lie down and fall asleep for like 9 hours)

2. I'm drinking more water. I do usually have a cup of coffee with cream and sugar in the morning, but the headache starts before I have coffee.

3. I do regularly spend a lot of time in front of computer devices. I work on a computer at work, and my favorite passtimes are MMOs and other video games.

4. I've got some hot garbage vision, but I wear my glasses all the time.

5. The pain.... roams? that's the best way to explain it. It doesn't just sit in one location. Sometimes its behind my eye (either eye). Sometimes it's on my temple. Sometimes it's at the back of my head, or the top.

I have really bad anxiety about actually going to the doctor or the hospital. Hospitals freak me out and I worry that if I go to the doctor they'll send me there. .... I also have a $20 copay for each visit, and a $100 copay if I go to the hospital.

When I have loose fitting clothes I can feel it pulse against that, or if I’m sat against a leather chair or laying on my back I can feel it, sometimes it’s to the right other times it’s to the left. I want to go to A&amp;E but my mum won’t listen and says it’s just my anxiety, but I’ve never had this before. :( I can’t drive so I’m just stuck and feel like I’m waiting for it to burst suddenly, it’s been like this for a week and is progressively more apparent each day",0.1168660287081309,2.2811764473684235,1.876076555023925,96.99435406698565,87.15789473684212,5.349282296650718,20.215311004784688,6.7829847944221076,0.1820526315789479,695,22,163,9,22,227,108,190,0.136,0.818,0.046,-0.9091,2,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,3,0,3,7,4,0,0,6,0,12,2,2,1,1,32,33,17,1,3,7,1,9,3,0,1,0,2,0,0,17,11,0,2,7,0,0,3,6,1,0,0,4,11,17,3,17,28,2,19,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,4,12,95,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14795899473936466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.160096490138366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11303500136410825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22723463999749585,0.0,0.09007233231035823,0.0,0.12573177108837852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529213797850013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15335020291333654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327959923734806,0.0,0.1392937525390158,0.0,0.4482674314127255,0.2111176901627312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1679493490631193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13066253077324194,0.0,0.2647255455637615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3501895427823399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13133472200778107,0.0,0.0,0.0812043175098533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605402603085879,0.0,0.0,0.2165623122892143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14844347465975935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11396061877480587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413851210237434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15715956584145874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12618512279223945,0.0,0.11750364914917548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251954673443507,0.0,0.14613713286474028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12914761686818665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17231857288144006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715190978525296,0.0,0.11852311678450715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,silentlyloud12,2019/04/04,"Freaking out It’s past midnight here and I have work early in the morning. I have been feeling this pain in the left side of my chest for the past hour every time I breathe. I don’t know what it is and it’s freaking me out. This is what I wrote out in my notes:

What I think I have:
- GERD
- Angina
- Pleurisy

What I’m feeling:
- Dull pain in left chest area, towards the middle of the boob (this is new and just started happening)
- Burning feeling in area before stomach starts (comes and goes)
- Constant burning/pain sensation in left chest area (comes and goes randomly)


I don’t know how to calm myself down. I can’t fall asleep because I’m scared because I feel like I have some sort of blood clot that will burst any second now.

healthanxiety,jordannn_1212,2019/04/05,"Anyone else? (HARD thump from the heart) As for a little back story, I’m 22, and I used to smoke weed all the time. Long story short, I got home from work one day about half a year ago, smoked what I then considered a normal amount of weed, and then was watching videos when I basically had a panic attack (racing heart, thinking I’m going to die, the works)
This was especially confusing because of the fact that nothing had changed or differed from my usual schedule. I had no reason to have anxiety over anything, and was in a happy place mentally, but, whatever. Anxiety.
It got to the point where I felt that way more and more, to the point that I started to feel my heart rhythm go crazy all the time, which then led to me visiting a cardiologist. They did every test imaginable and everything came back perfect, with the doc lightly suggesting I exercise a little more, but it’s not super necessary. He said it was anxiety related and that I didn’t need any meds, but prescribed me a blood thinner to take if my heart were to ever go absolutely crazy again. I never did take them, and it ultimately got better. I now do think it was me just tripping out in my mind.
So fast forward and I have a different issue. During my stint of heart related anxiety, one symptom I got towards the end (the worst of all) was when I would lay down at night, or be any bit more tired than usual, my heart would THUD extremely hard. It started with the occasional thud by itself, and as the days went on it became 2 thuds, 3 thuds, 4 thuds, all about 10 seconds apart from each other, increasing in force. It felt as if my heart rhythm would be thrown off, and then this thud came out of nowhere, and it was SUCH a forceful punch of a feeling that it scared the hell out of me. I was a cigarette smoker at the time, and completely stopped. I also stopped drinking even occasionally, as these things are known to increase the chance of palpitations. It got to the point where I would even get these thuds when I just woke up, and right before I went to sleep, and they seemed to be triggered when I laid down, or bent over to tie my shoe or whatever the case may be. I considered the fact that my cardiologist said my heart was fine so I just tried not to think about it.
It stopped eventually, for about 2 months. Now they’re back. In the last 2 weeks, this has occurred 3 nights now. I’ve also noticed that a flutter (thud of the same kind but to a much lesser degree) happens when I take a deep breath sometimes, not always. Again, when I’m tired. I’m wondering if this is worth another trip to the cardiologist, or if this is something others have experienced and gotten past themselves. I don’t have health insurance so I don’t want to go spend upwards of 1000 dollars to be told they’re benign, although they feel like my heart will explode when they happen. Does this sound familiar to anyone?",6.092767173514504,6.190515978647692,6.2952345519249455,80.26169794025667,66.25978647686833,9.587921923864988,30.90930658902189,9.339509955726095,2.479584104389087,2268,78,453,39,33,726,268,562,0.11,0.8270000000000001,0.063,-0.9784,1,0,6,0,0,0,71.0,0,0,5,5,33,14,2,3,36,0,38,19,13,4,9,81,81,49,1,11,19,0,7,1,0,6,5,3,1,0,34,23,1,3,13,3,3,15,8,6,0,4,32,13,45,8,65,38,16,93,1,0,1,0,11,31,1,13,49,301,79,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05145020097443657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0928313766343797,0.048295096175698035,0.0,0.0,0.07894028755191293,0.06086147086111714,0.17760605506639782,0.0,0.0,0.081167795804541,0.05947027550238194,0.04776312850873763,0.0,0.0,0.06603047405687873,0.0,0.13389076667849895,0.0,0.035381500020382144,0.0,0.04938895826520711,0.0,0.0,0.05133290350346319,0.06336617853953237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13276780327185447,0.0,0.0,0.06140010744303798,0.0,0.06085530585415112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07486380546273103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06023781186001183,0.12128182349569072,0.0,0.0,0.05079242214202,0.0,0.0,0.05685847749925274,0.0,0.0,0.04848614377333491,0.0,0.05140745469031387,0.0,0.0,0.07667159741669177,0.05250177116365102,0.048902384603475436,0.0,0.05216386970728687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08804243060464235,0.04146478928211733,0.11145769631290248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030324237044753993,0.0,0.1319450655907256,0.0,0.2321050573498103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265164044575316,0.06178615184767738,0.1039873916386062,0.0,0.0,0.06169529633066359,0.0,0.6190140688906919,0.0,0.0,0.05822025874758267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06058014419874424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06044118867149718,0.0,0.04731148942237762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028356097298458588,0.1163454659244664,0.0,0.051364814432635186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06447091327396086,0.0,0.058492081868116136,0.0,0.05860527041200499,0.0,0.046328093436492614,0.0,0.04266710889819125,0.04303696424280613,0.0447651074650797,0.0,0.0,0.10893584814166288,0.05686825073529795,0.05569229073333827,0.06608052102596736,0.0,0.0,0.07866071241928094,0.0,0.0,0.0680990796861476,0.0,0.0,0.05540708585893872,0.0,0.0,0.06064091174784536,0.0,0.1646036569686807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059676228176155234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049567040290041615,0.11042132955454567,0.0,0.058109568941117226,0.0,0.0,0.052838712620649333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058083318940993986,0.0,0.0,0.044683107009496535,0.05740443082584406,0.0,0.08216400633653267,0.0,0.0,0.14557563331920415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06032724047371722,0.13091973319060274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03856012853612992,0.1115717606360901,0.0,0.0,0.10153322502368063,0.13342010703689686,0.0,0.05546104704917276,0.0,0.03940630211163696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05012913591828297,0.12784880884727667,0.0,0.034234322779811754,0.04607056340948616,0.046557311788900414,0.0,0.0,0.10760992254123894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294342473442875,0.08450966404737863,0.0,0.0,0.16492378714870984,0.0,0.0,0.037376760012508364
healthanxiety,kstrak011,2019/04/05,"I don’t know what to do This is long I’m sorry. 

Symptoms started in January, just feeling off, super tired, nauseous, headaches almost everyday, always feel as if I’m about to get sick (hot throat, run down, feeling like lymph nodes were swollen, etc). At this time I was attempting to recover from binge eating disorder and going through a bout of seasonal depression, and my doctor said it’s the depression making me feel all this. Prescribed me Zoloft, which I took for two weeks and stopped because the headaches I got everyday were unimaginable. 

The feeling of something being off physically never goes away. Start to feel a constant ache in my ears down the side of my neck and under my jaw. I mean literally every second of everyday. Still frequent headaches. Still feel lymph nodes are swollen. Wake up one morning at the end of March and my throat feels worse than it has in 10 years. Go to medexpress and I have strep. I thought maybe that’s what it’s been all this time?! Antibiotics work after a few days on the throat but all other symptoms remain. 

Between February and March I went to an ENT who basically dismissed me and said I have TMJ, looked in my ears which he said looked perfectly healthy. So then I go to my dentist and he took an x ray of my entire head showing all jaw joints, which are normal. No sign of grinding. Looked confused when I told him right in the morning when I wake up is when I feel the best, then it gets worse throughout the day. Still gave me a mouth guard to wear at night but makes no difference. 

If I was in constant anxiety over this I would chalk it up to that but I’m really not. My CBC, diff, platelets, and all my chemistries were all normal, so that helps a lot. I’m just so tired of feeling this way. Constant headaches and nausea, with a weird ache/pressure/sensation (not painful or tender) in my ears, down my neck, under my jaw, with pain in my shoulders and the back of my neck sometimes. Some tinges of chest pains here and there. 

What the heck do I do next? See an allergist? Get a more thorough thyroid battery?

healthanxiety,LostinMD,2019/04/05,"Just so scary. So, I’ve had health anxiety for most of my life. Like over 30 years. I am a nurse. It was easy to go into healthcare because Id spent so much of my life researching different diseases I was sure I had, or thought I had a good chance of getting, or someone I knew I had. I used to really obsessively research stuff, it somehow made me feel better. Anyway. Now, I’m a nurse. I just finished a 4 day stretch of shifts (14 hours a day, no time for meal breaks or any rest at all during work) and I only had time to sleep about 6 hours between shifts. So, I know rationally that my body and mind are exhausted and that exacerbates the health anxiety. But I woke this morning and every single muscle in my legs and back hurt so bad I can hardly walk. My hands are clammy and cold and sweaty (this never happens). I keep swinging between feeling really hot and then getting really chilled. I also have severe emetophobia and I’m terrified I’m coming down with something. My tummy feels weird like I need to poop but I can’t. I can’t stand the thought of food. My throat hurts. And all of this is setting off major panic attacks so bad I feel like I can’t leave my house. (I have a therapy appt in an hour and I really really need to go grocery shopping). Please help. Do you think I’m sick?  Thanks.

healthanxiety,Hectorc34,2019/04/05,"I have a rabies fear, can anyone help out? This all started last June, I was playing with my dog in my yard. He lunges forward and I reached out with my hand and his tooth scraped my middle finger. It did cut the skin and I was bleeding. My finger was tingling at the site where he bit me. I went to go wash it off and didn’t think much of it until I looked on the fridge and I see my dog was a week overdue on his rabies vaccine. I panicked and wasn’t sure what I should do. I know of rabies, but I didn’t KNOW rabies until my dumb mind did some googling. 

If you know where the googling is going, then you understand my fear. If you don’t, just don’t worry about it. 

My dog at the time is a 13 year old German Shepherd. He is prone to seizures and would have a couple of them a year. We’ve had him for 11 years so we know how to handle the situation. He also drooled and foamed a lot in the mouth. That was his natural way. He’s been vaccinated every year as it is required in the state of New Mexico. 

I did go to urgent care and received a Tetanus shot since I was overdue on that one but my doctor told me that it’s been over 40 years since a dog had rabies in my area. so I did not receive the rabies shots. Which made me feel better honestly. For about 5 months. 

In October, my dog was put down because he was struggling to stand up and seemed like he was in pain a lot. 

In late November, I got what seemed like a week long cold. Sore throat, tired, drained and all that junk. I was sick but not terrible so I went to a concert and I started to feel worse. For some dumb reason, the first thing that appeared in my mind was rabies. And I almost panicked because of it and couldn’t enjoy the show. I went home after feeling very horrible. I couldn’t sleep, a headache kicked in, my fever rose and it’s like my mind was repeating the same scene over and over all night long and I couldn’t sleep at all. Then I woke up around 5 am with a racing heartbeat that wouldn’t slow down at all. I felt awful and was fearful about rabies. 

Since that day, I never ignored my finger where my dog bit me. I still feel pain and a minor tingling sensation where he bit me and all I can think about is if I have rabies. It’s practically on a daily basis I look at the spot. I have no idea how to get past this. It’s been 9 months since the incident and I still worry about getting it. I just can’t shake this fear out of my mind. I thought the spot where he bit me would be gone but the area is still red as if it’s been only a couple of weeks since he’s bitten me. 

I’ve tried everything, such as logic. It’s exceedingly rare in the US, most rabies cases have been from bats in the US or contracted outside. Last person to die from a dog rabies in the US was in 1974. Basically when my parents were still kids. And I’m 25 now. My dog survived the 10 day quarantine and we vaccinated him after those 10 days just in case. 

Like I can’t shake the fear. Each time my finger is in pain or even get a tingling sensation, my mind instantly jumps to that conclusion. I almost don’t care about anything else. I have stomach pains and I’m going to see a gastroenterologist about it, I really wouldn’t care if they told me I had cancer. Rabies is just something that truly sparks fear in my mind. 

I even freak out seeing bats in the sky since I work at stadiums as a camera guy.

healthanxiety,Snowbrdr1,2019/04/06,"Scared about Stomach Cancer I’ve had some pretty bad abdominal pain/cramping the last few days that also moves up my chest and feels like heartburn when I lie down. It was so bad today I went to the ER because I was getting pretty nervous. I told my symptoms to the doctor which include pain in my mid/high abdomen, more pain when lying down, more heartburn at night etc. 

He told me I had classic symptoms of acid reflux and put me on some Zantac. I just started it today and he gave me a months worth to take until it helps with the Acid Reflux. He also told me that when he checked with his stethoscope that all my bowel sounds were normal and it my digestive track was working fine. I asked him if I needed a CT or if they found anything strange and he said no.

But I’ve dug myself deep into a hole and I’m convinced from all the shit I’ve read online that the abdominal pain is from stomach cancer even though I don’t show other signs. Can anyone give me some tips on how to deal with this HA? It’s getting really bad now, and I’m sure the stress is probably adding to my pain/cramps.

healthanxiety,Scap3Goat,2019/04/06,"Circulatory problems. Cause for concern? I'm a very thin dude, just under 120 lbs and probably 5'8"" or so. I have pretty big hands, long gangly fingers and have a friend my age who is 6'5 (probably twice my weight), who has only slightly bigger hands. Bad circulation is kind of a family thing, and my Dad has troubles with it. Every girl I've been with will continually comment on how cold my hands are, it ruins some things in that regard for me. Sometimes when I start to get warm again after coming indoors or holding a cold one for a while orange spots begin to appear, but my hands rarely warm up to my body's temperature. Should I care now or just worry about getting healthier overall?

healthanxiety,eclipsed419,2019/04/06,"Kidney infection? I’m a 36yo female.
A few weeks ago I recognized a UTI coming on. I did what we all do and started drinking a ton of water and taking my cranberry/probiotic capsules. By chance, my annual gyno exam was like two days after it started. Even though my symptoms had started to get better (with still occasional pain with urination) I asked them about it. They said they didn’t see anything, but I begged and she begrudgingly gave me 3 days worth of antibiotics. 
Then I started getting back pain.. but this is normal for me, I have back problems. It was across my lower back so didn’t seem to be specifically over my kidneys. It got pretty bad and I went to urgent care where they did another urine which was clear again (possibly because of the super short dose of antibiotics the week prior) they gave me muscle relaxants and sent me on my way. 
The NEXT week (this week) the pain started to intensify. It started keeping me up at night and was definitely over where my right kidney should be. Back to urgent care. They said I had blood etc in my itinerary this time. Did a CT scan but didn’t see stones. Gave me fluids and pain meds, and a script for  keflex and sent me on my way. 
I got about two doses under my belt, and woke up yesterday morning with excruciating pain that now radiated to my abdomen as well. I was getting cold chills and nausea. I headed for the ER. 
They ran a gamut of tests on me and concluded that it’s a raging kidney infection. They admitted me and I’ve been on IV pain meds and antibiotics. My white cell count, which was pretty high, is normalizing. No more chills or nausea. 
My question is, why isn’t my pain going away? When the meds wear off it’s still excruciating! I’m a realist.. I know there’s still going to be SOME pain.. I’ve been in the hospital for two days though and it ruts almost exclusively in my abdomen now. The nurse can’t seem to explain it to me, and I won’t see the doctor until the morning. I’m concerned that this is something more nefarious than a kidney infection but I’m wondering if anyone has had an experience like this or has any input at all really that might help. 
Thank you so much in advance!

healthanxiety,Sandra86says,2019/04/06,"Thanks, Ancestry😔 Hi guys!
So i recently took an Ancestry DNA test and I bought access to the records. My maternal grandmother apparently died of Uterine Cancer at 40 years old. My grandmother was always told it was lung cancer. She thought it made sense since her mother was a very heavy tobacco smoker. Anywho, now I’m constantly worried about this. I also have PCOS that makes me have irregular periods. Just crappy thoughts and i hate this! I’ve had health anxiety in the past. Luckily I have my therapist appointment on Monday so I’ll talk to him about this “new fact”. Thanks for listening.

healthanxiety,interstate-lovesong,2019/04/06,"Very scared about joint pain, have had health anxiety for months Hi all, 

I'm 20 years old and since November I have been suffering from health anxiety. I have always has mild anxiety but it never got in the way of me living my life. Now though everyday, all I can think about is my health and the symptoms I have. In the past four months I have thought I have breast cancer, lung cancer, gallstones, stomach ulcers, peripheral artery disease, peripheral neuropathy, etc. The list goes on. I have been to the doctors so many times. As soon as I'm not worrying about one symptom anymore, a new one shows up. 

For the past month I have had strange feelings in my legs (random numbness and shooting pains). My feet also get red and burn when I stand for too long. My doc diagnosed me with venous insufficiency but I couldn't stop worrying it was something else. I started noticing that a lot of the time the pain is in my joints. Since then, almost 24/7 I have some pain in my joints ranging from mild to very painful. Yesterday I even started feeling pain in my TM joint. I am convinced I have rheumatoid arthritis because I also have lack of appetite and low iron. I emailed my doctor about this Tuesday and she hasn't gotten back to me and I am so worried I am thinking I'm going to go to an urgent care. I have also read that joint pain can result from anxiety which I try to convince myself that that is what is happening to me but I am still so worried.

My mom is trying to convince me that I am fine but she doesn't know that for sure. I am literally on the verge of tears almost all of the time and cry almost daily. I can't focus on schoolwork because my mind always drifts back to the pain. I am so tired of living like this and not being able to tell if my symptoms are a result from anxiety or from a disease. I just want to go back to how I was before.

Has anyone here experienced something similar? Should I go to an urgent care just in case?

Is this normal to have??/",1.4731648351648374,3.808603569230773,1.828351648351649,98.49307692307691,82.53846153846155,4.945054945054945,15.439560439560445,6.18269132825596,-0.7964285714285713,252,4,57,2,7,76,47,65,0.021,0.831,0.14800000000000002,0.8519,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,4,2,0,0,3,0,7,5,4,0,0,10,9,5,0,1,3,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,3,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,3,6,1,7,7,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,4,42,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828180763391703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3378901012322233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18695882309856945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11109304445603282,0.15696237532663262,0.21095808111645972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6764640355971501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10734023888742396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2152712185597073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30464142556046425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2368868155142032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675501592646669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,havehopejay,2019/04/06,"I Love you ALL! Last year March I experienced my first panic attack followed by a few more which led me to a spiral of anxiety and health anxiety which I didn’t even know was a thing till recently. I felt so alone especially when I looked around at everyone else and they seem to be fine and dandy. After searching this thread and reading everyone’s posts has given me a lot of hope and can’t thank everyone enough for contributing their experiences and how they’ve managed or beat their anxieties.

Battling this awful feeling has made me appreciate everything in life a whole lot more and to love A LOT More. Also To not take life so damn seriously and to remember that we are human and that life is short. Anyways just wanted to thank everyone in this community for all the support and informative threads. I Love you ALL!

healthanxiety,bradlove11,2019/04/06,"what should be the Best time of my life, is being absolutely destroyed by ALS fears I dont know what to do. I have had twitching, muscles in specific areas decreasing, and feelings of weakness marked by certain muscles seemingly taking over for the ones that are lost, such as when i walk, ect. for over three years this has been an issue that i have had to ensure myself that it's nothing, and was able to ignore it blissfully for the most part, especially last year in an exciting freshman year of college. But then, back in august i met an amazing girl and suddenly everything came crashing down. My future was important to ensure for myself, so I started paying more attention to my body for reassurance. And boom. The issue was not gone, and I knew it. It was worse, in fact. It had spread. The next three months were nothing short of hell. I lost myself. No sense of self. Life itself felt super meaningless and artificial. I thought about death daily. How to kill myself in the least horrible way if i got the diagnosis. My faith was depleted. It felt like I actually died inside. And all this at the time that should have been THE BEST of my life, aka honeymoon phase of a new exciting relationship. It effected us negatively, obviously.  Thank God, in december I somehow felt like i came back to life. I can only credit God for answering my distressed, desperate prayers the entire month prior. I was able to focus on my life and my relationship in Jan, Feb, and march, which were all GREAT, with these health worries still present but always able to be beaten. But today i find myself in a situation trying to schedule an appointment for an EMG, in order to finally out this away, after getting dismissed without a checkup back in october. im scheduled for june to get checked and HOPEFULLY sent to an EMG. I just cant let this ruin my life anymore. I need to know. This is the loneliest feeling ever. My body has something going on. I just need to know.",4.541648550724638,6.5528662445652195,5.4190000000000005,78.05933333333333,71.33695652173913,8.493623188405797,29.65797101449275,9.120678840339163,2.7321007971014493,1550,64,274,33,30,506,206,368,0.112,0.764,0.123,-0.1918,0,0,1,0,0,2,50.0,1,0,0,7,13,26,4,2,20,0,31,12,2,2,6,52,59,19,3,6,8,0,5,2,0,2,10,1,0,2,21,14,0,1,15,0,3,6,6,11,0,3,26,6,35,15,55,27,8,58,2,3,0,0,8,20,1,5,32,203,56,4,0.2681711877979739,0.0,0.08723213171063822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07437997033128686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08865125284927798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08398521953062704,0.20620709019710448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18761941116431768,0.0,0.0,0.1985851565178653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20447759814752933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927731180546626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10476487828814517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08085873081783819,0.0,0.0,0.0803383239382695,0.0,0.0,0.1005890474336273,0.09039694012885327,0.0,0.257486395144158,0.09792280937619273,0.08170120243888337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09340558484456156,0.0,0.05080262201101217,0.0,0.0714936655954221,0.09855322709157516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501781079305163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878483288745814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09655696707622737,0.1866006979994402,0.0,0.0,0.09889722881047924,0.0,0.1473798715313225,0.0728651034623305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09140773622576168,0.3788344814118698,0.08734326433878144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951603534275177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14270112239864896,0.0,0.0,0.13256369184494354,0.0,0.08633380141857518,0.09506770018631316,0.0,0.0,0.1715449915393912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06057324572559916,0.06798542419229821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09680108776457644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19194366361975854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08137765918861398,0.09325367827871593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10047855033907868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881709400857261,0.0,0.0,0.06327098233097818,0.0,0.0713872856621024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06721045296932279,0.0,0.0,0.08229866659633664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07096598936641099,0.10424851745370928,0.0,0.08473164319950932,0.0,0.0,0.060690211098578875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075256399578349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709539355109012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08616915177536456,0.0,0.0,0.0907802861826911,0.0910964502905536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17269345260413396
healthanxiety,hmkvibe,2019/04/06,"Seeing a therapist for health anxiety Has anyone seen a therapist for health anxiety? I’ve read a couple of posts where one person said they didn’t find it helpful, others were debating on going to a therapist/psychiatrist, but I can’t remember if anyone has actually talked about seeing one and how/if it helped. 

If anyone has any experience with seeing a therapist about health anxiety please let me know! Hopefully this thread can be used in the future too so add in your experience if you feel comfortable doing so.",8.99231578947368,8.760887810526313,9.457894736842107,61.095263157894756,60.368421052631575,13.915789473684216,35.84210526315789,13.023866798666859,5.235273684210528,422,16,67,15,5,142,66,95,0.05,0.8109999999999999,0.138,0.8858,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,2,1,0,6,2,0,0,6,0,10,3,0,1,0,13,20,7,0,4,4,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,4,3,0,0,4,1,0,1,2,0,0,2,4,6,5,2,10,14,0,7,0,0,4,0,8,4,0,4,1,46,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.11796377439313392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08220416990941437,0.0,0.2774240906714023,0.0,0.0,0.2535713316131993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337540644620003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2364923443555449,0.0,0.0,0.06112176810353717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11048431378609587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06870024753454293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38547698110491424,0.0,0.0,0.16204983481746765,0.0,0.0,0.1200634879703501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06643379977261969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236104330190047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16382607080466502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10554983962357352,0.0,0.13269256307314833,0.0,0.0,0.11577191390259778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12091510172019848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13693618238289695,0.0,0.11498683394529073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28898284055924645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09716068551867724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5614150836164049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10440357222485952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,LankyDamage,2019/04/07,"Suddenly Developed Health Anxiety Greetings Redditors,

This is my first post ever on this website, honestly the first blog that I could think of to go to and I really need some advice. Im a 21 year old Male.

When I turned 21 in September I developed a severe drinking habit. I would drink every night to black out. This continued from September through January. After January first I decided to quit cold turkey which I believe caused my body a great deal of stress. When I was detoxing I began to google my symptoms. This was my first obsession with my health. I settled on having Diabetes. It all added up in my head, the light headedness, tingling in my feet and hands, and lots of sweating. I went to the doctor after 2 to 3 days of intense worry to find out I was perfectly healthy with near perfect cholesterol, sugar, iron, etc levels.

In around mid February I came to the conclusion that this is an anxiety disorder.

I was talking to someone on FaceTime and laughed really hard at what they said. While I was laughing I felt/heard a click in my head (probably just my jaw) and immediately thought I had had a brain aneurysm. I then for the next three or four days was having terrible (what I know now) panic attacks.

This transitioned into me believing that my panic attacks were Heart attacks and the slurred speech I got when I was coming out of the attack to be me having a Stroke despite not ever displaying symptoms of Stroke, Heart Attack, Aneurysm, etc. 

The attacks would be so bad that I would for days feel like I was walking around in a dream, a buzzing feeling in my head, strong sensitivity to light and sound. I just felt like complete shit always. This was often paired up with severe tension headaches and the sensation of cold water being poured on my head (always the right side which further worried me, thought I was having strokes)

Every single day since that day it has been something else. Ive convinced myself that I am anemic, diabetic, having liver failure, having appendicitis, having eye cancer, tonsil cancer, bone cancer. You name it I've probably convinced myself of it.

Currently I am struggling with a bump behind my right molar. This is on the side of the gum line and more than 100% sure it is a wisdom tooth coming in completely sideways (as I am that age). However my sympathetic nervous system decided to force me to believe that it was a tumor and that I was going to die. This caused me to have probably close to a dozen panic attacks over the course of around 3 hours. Each one lasting anywhere from a few minutes to 20-30. Hyperventilation, racing heart, sharp chest pain, feeling of impending doom, sweating, and aggressive crying.

Before I quit drinking, I never worried about anything. I could handle an extreme workload without even the slightest repercussion. And now seemingly every single day its a new worry that makes it so that I just want to fucking die. 

Ive never seen a Doctor for the disorder, just to have them check up on the symptoms that I think I'm experiencing.

My main question is, has this happened to anyone before? Like an anxiety disorder developing seemingly overnight, the course of a few days? Or is this extremely abnormal.

At this point Im just really really scared and want to start to feel normal again. I don't know what to do..",6.525213114754099,7.63879679180328,6.742090163934424,73.88706967213119,65.50819672131148,9.640983606557377,34.10245901639344,9.766711354998122,3.4742262295081967,2633,115,440,54,40,847,294,610,0.188,0.72,0.092,-0.9962,2,0,4,0,0,0,77.0,0,1,2,10,21,37,10,9,36,0,48,44,20,3,8,80,80,23,2,9,9,0,11,3,0,3,18,3,0,1,37,29,5,0,18,5,1,8,5,23,0,8,25,24,62,14,81,47,12,85,1,1,4,1,9,37,2,8,41,319,99,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051565019209532034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08781566708977212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12110386540150445,0.0,0.0,0.03689714225255476,0.0,0.04342419131986214,0.1409261456857839,0.0,0.4202245580508383,0.0,0.0,0.04405970844818944,0.0,0.0,0.08980465223942355,0.1783569589021583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058614193834948786,0.0,0.05890738516376578,0.0,0.06035340094336718,0.0,0.10841609976841292,0.0,0.09091122442419444,0.11065407676366748,0.0,0.0,0.0842631182303546,0.0,0.0579640023997742,0.2382203824364545,0.054402272022991686,0.0,0.0,0.10953127856440524,0.0,0.18143270366029968,0.10802211882606848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15507987953292993,0.0,0.0,0.04408152584038689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11770222704270199,0.034853266724486034,0.09546472464528513,0.1333798625416878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10672587747659164,0.03769801097712937,0.10133256509521073,0.0,0.04822968846486048,0.17954031304952806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04878386610193556,0.0,0.0,0.05997940200750534,0.0,0.042203995974936695,0.058177741550241524,0.0,0.0,0.04666323807912447,0.0,0.047270441974317116,0.0,0.21662387636108996,0.11218144351278096,0.0,0.187593695502856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051966596784741435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11399862675660966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05800065831559865,0.04301358040081321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07734044853956548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04486211068764271,0.0,0.0,0.03522355545784903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03912736513404474,0.08139703791229677,0.05096439491841975,0.05612017236204715,0.04951990435917157,0.05170217858538546,0.0,0.0,0.055371934446593885,0.0,0.03575747581972818,0.0,0.056149678566388236,0.18573830215854725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0498835323070693,0.0,0.0505378831542838,0.0,0.1706809371292005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059113085215768586,0.11225213829661487,0.0,0.0,0.13522006937361222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012846134316044,0.05019517240681758,0.0,0.05283073194738861,0.0,0.0,0.09607739013639134,0.0,0.11922735212925258,0.054166371374714715,0.043650861588638484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04471079707812504,0.04062396765302535,0.0,0.0,0.037349998232541017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060446433550181124,0.05516536277498287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0497339295506734,0.1645408318458952,0.0,0.04241352851836065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06762417832923329,0.0,0.08378499842283063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05739725534468367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062248760854285615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04891716696794123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05086719927428172,0.0,0.0,0.21435693921970184,0.0,0.11245623418017407,0.0,0.0,0.03398134980632224

healthanxiety,weepingmarshmallow,2019/04/07,"I'm getting a colonoscopy and I'm freaking terrified I've had minor GI bleeding for a while that warrants a colonoscopy. I want to do it because at the very least it'll give me a peace of mind but it's the biggest procedure I've had so far in my life and the first time I'll be under sedation, so I'm absolutely freaking out. I'm 25, people my age don't usually go under colonoscopies so it's kind of hard to talk about this with others. 

Even the prep alone sounds awful thanks to all the horror stories. I know it's a routine procedure for folks way older than me but I'm still pretty scared. Has anyone here gotten a colonoscopy at a young age? One of the things that concerns me is that I've heard people who have IBS have worse symptoms after the procedure likely due to the prep.",4.192154882154881,4.983679629629631,4.940056116722784,85.8757070707071,70.60493827160494,7.619304152637486,28.30751964085297,7.686295010490155,1.5809802469135796,628,22,129,7,11,203,98,162,0.17800000000000002,0.753,0.069,-0.9592,0,1,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,1,7,6,0,1,15,1,10,3,0,0,1,10,23,8,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,1,3,2,0,0,12,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,3,0,2,4,3,7,3,19,17,2,21,0,0,0,0,4,8,0,0,12,77,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2266694735675085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15302965016788925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13341297535225988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14455274550936084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18615934473285814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434356053579647,0.20994722988789252,0.12438127109765808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960525600898099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2279055102199324,0.12027788481272933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15458491598923313,0.10692229859633516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22098281566596226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14830292216468022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.303455272749588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2226558815302508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2191136747850066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17477919405300024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22747584590120384,0.0,0.17590867572138652,0.0,0.20149378822762026,0.0,0.0,0.14539862569442044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12761706578971527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.241039667251695,0.1805796471167688,0.1290873156478176,0.17371821254253642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22303361187081244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,BwianWilson,2019/04/07,"Skin cancer fears Skin cancer is a specific fear of mine because of a few awful burns I've had in the past. I'm pale, so I burn incredibly easily. I am 100% convinced I am going to get skin cancer eventually.

There's a small bump on the back of my head, no bigger than the tip of my thumb. I can't see it, but apparently it's pink. You know when you get a bump on your head from hitting it and there's sort of a dull pain when pressure is applied to it? That's how it feels when I press on the bump that's on the back of my head. It's hard, you can't really press down on it.

As I type this I'm pretty anxious because I'm convinced whatever the bump on my head is is going to kill me. There are so many different ways skin cancer can look, and I'm scared that's what I have. I don't remember hitting my head on anything recently, and even if I did, I've never had a bump form that was that small before.",2.83902203324314,3.008345557788949,4.7890452261306535,87.99216466950138,73.321608040201,8.133127174333206,24.352918438345576,8.139509932561175,1.0693707769617316,702,18,168,10,13,243,99,199,0.23,0.7140000000000001,0.056,-0.9885,2,0,0,0,0,1,19.0,0,4,0,0,12,9,1,4,12,1,16,14,9,1,1,11,30,12,1,1,2,0,8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,14,3,0,0,3,0,0,2,5,7,0,0,4,11,20,2,21,24,2,23,0,1,3,0,4,12,0,2,8,104,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15265876615629742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11120071610814043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2078137062314826,0.0,0.16474834300382668,0.0,0.11498592530263985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411823936653846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08925228313228549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3041182929281743,0.06832593562449517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1412000000876311,0.0,0.153595317546464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12105019894493806,0.0,0.6934133211611572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14950164639453245,0.0,0.07426407427981342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11347541147813235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370009061055062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042208113705132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14378815761546115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12899715360672148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13747608673485673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656792498321329,0.0,0.13342486067720882,0.0,0.1530762782632345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13528899552309448,0.0,0.10768134699674567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10726013564423766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,dumdumgurrl,2019/04/07,"Scared I’ve got cervical cancer; Hiya. 

I’ve been trying to keep my HA at bay, been plagued by it for 15yrs almost now. Currently worrying I have cervical cancer and I can’t check because I have vaginismus whenever I try to have smear tests. I’ve had a lot going on since October last year and tried to seek answers from health professionals (I say that so lightly) and people on Reddit for advice. I’ve had loads of symptoms since January that you can get with various stages of cervical cancer but I don’t know if it’s based on basic stuff. I’ve had around 5+ blood tests, stool samples, ultrasounds of my ovaries in that time and two unsuccessful smear exams. I’m super scared but apparently any changes could be picked up in bloodwork I’ve been told by a semi professional, my bf’s mum is a GP so I try to ask him to get her opinions etc. I’m so scared and keep googling cervical cancer and the signs. Tho I’ve had swabs taken from just outside my cervix tho that won’t detect any normalities. I just wanna be normal and not worry. This is the second cancer scare I’ve put myself through since February :/",3.6281565656565684,5.431455522727274,4.784848484848486,82.52671717171718,73.31818181818181,8.161616161616159,26.31313131313132,8.841846274778883,2.022782828282828,885,31,172,18,18,291,133,220,0.2,0.755,0.045,-0.9888,2,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,1,9,6,0,4,5,1,19,8,1,1,0,28,31,15,0,5,6,1,0,0,1,1,7,1,0,0,8,9,0,2,2,0,1,2,4,4,0,2,10,3,16,2,25,17,3,16,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,4,5,97,24,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12455318049785424,0.0,0.0,0.1276335404973808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17335537662496547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11346710056251742,0.11915860562005115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07769889687260123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13483658447027358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017670461016457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14215244127300816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13318597377292352,0.0,0.07243888782468631,0.0,0.10194201435350747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1354848286352849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2265859617337969,0.0,0.0,0.07004910087226059,0.10389753219622766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10836258098319028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2497689666442481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836524288796598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12813326972817232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10136191306712923,0.5104418299807758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31631057598819895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14591207665329972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13248053455833508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07432339476574827,0.0,0.0,0.12179421936994568,0.0,0.3461499599665169,0.0,0.12451064274811385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2588851798261688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08208055113465725

healthanxiety,focyyzsg,2019/04/07,"Severe health anxiety... lost 15 lbs. need support. I started having abdominal pain that radiates to the back in January, did a bunch of blood test, ultrasound and x-Ray.  I was diagnosed with Fatty Liver which is not related to my pain.  I was told to loose weight and that I should be good.

I was on a diet for a month after the fatty liver diagnose, lost 4KG in a month which scared the hell out of me but I keep telling myself it’s because I’m on a diet.  But I’m also noticing that my appetite isn’t very good, I have bad days and good days.  I just feel nauseous on bad days like I literally don’t wanna eat anything.  My pain has almost gone away now.

Now I’m obsessing over cancer like lymphoma and things like that, checking my lymph nodes and literally I feel pain in my groin area.

I’ve always had health anxiety all my life but last 3 months I feel really depressed over my health anxiety, constant worrying.

Any suggestions? Planning on going back to my doctor?  I’m not eating as much these days due to nausea.  I don’t even know how to explain to my doctor anymore.  This weight loss is concerning is though on good days, I control my diet due to fatty liver...",3.312245916515426,5.042061939655174,4.78676043557169,82.49217785843922,74.0,7.815245009074411,26.003629764065337,8.532816995589336,1.8786689655172413,918,32,177,17,19,307,130,232,0.229,0.675,0.096,-0.9867,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,5,9,21,1,2,8,0,16,25,4,2,1,26,34,12,0,3,6,0,5,3,0,1,14,0,0,0,10,7,7,2,5,0,1,2,5,13,0,0,9,5,25,8,27,23,3,33,1,4,0,0,4,13,1,1,21,108,35,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09245916123520448,0.0,0.0,0.07383946472670926,0.07682928293918682,0.0,0.0,0.06279028481030895,0.0,0.21190576689350354,0.0,0.091570514988571,0.0,0.0,0.07598301286963953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08675083043578606,0.14199828982862372,0.15419006283348205,0.05628594808030722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09978024942948643,0.10356042991557304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.297738950082817,0.0,0.07952713705570884,0.18743412841848384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1890155186658051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18896146203063452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060985734761727035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1400605309278074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05247553881982149,0.3097815065816295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29444016596807304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207069978603675,0.0,0.0,0.050744350479428685,0.07526453190780208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06521823332696736,0.13532918214731546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2015869318744193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22110034851466545,0.0,0.06787611251068909,0.06846448945096084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10512286854555684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3929995350020069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05915152337419135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924424396507944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10431113575057364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06535447892350497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477952656049082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08070398391251841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06134260535885385,0.0,0.09071768408896927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822909183869862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07618521823036818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2248758689314068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09376965682247078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Legal_Transmigrant,2019/04/07,"Can brain tumors cause ear problems? (M 22)

My problems began last July. I went on a swimming pool and got an earful of water (the left one). Ever since, I've had the following symptoms:

Pain in the ear

Pain in the left side of my head, around the left ear, kind of above too.

Pain in the lower left side of my head, in a sort of bone or place behind/below the left ear

Feeling of pressure on left side of head and left ear

Feeling of something liquid in the left ear

Sometimes a bit of tinnitus on left ear

More recently, minor twitching sensation below and sometimes above left eye

I've tried those drops for swimmer's ear and had my ears cleaned by a specialist. I had a persistent ear infection (left ear, of course) for most of December. Went to an ear doctor in January and he said there was nothing he could find. Still, my symptoms persist. I'm now terrified that it could be a brain tumor.

healthanxiety,KovicMess,2019/04/07,"Health anxiety is ruining my life. I don’t know where else to vent. I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. Every other day I’m dying of a new disease and I just can’t take it anymore. Panic attack after panic attack, constantly researching symptoms and self diagnosing. When will it ever end? Some days I just feel like giving up, my anxiety is destroying me slowly. I don’t know if anyone will see this but I had to write this down somewhere and it’s good to know I’m not alone. Thanks for listening friends.

A few years ago I was bitten by a wild animal and received the rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Then last fall I was bitten by a different wild animal and received booster doses.

Now I've been scratched by a third wild animal. I don't want receive more doses of the vaccine. It is very expensive and could potentially harm me (cause Multiple sclerosis or GBS or some systemic inflammatory response). I can't imagine that many people have received this vaccine on three separate occasions within only a few years.

The experts say that while the potential for rabies exposure is very low, it can't be ruled out. To be certain that I won't develop rabies, I would need another two doses of the vaccine.

healthanxiety,lavendercaina,2019/04/08,"Dizziness, pressure in head, headaches, strange seizure-like episodes - brain tumor or sinus infection? Hey all. I'm making a doctor's appointment first thing in the moring but I'd like some advice on what I am experiencing in the meantime. 

For a couple months I have been getting these strange episodes that I can only describe as pseudo-seizures. One of the most notable symptoms is that I suddenly have this overwhelming sensation of physical buildup, like you get right before a good sneeze or before you start crying. However, that release doesn't come, so I get urges to make noise like moaning or screaming to force the feeling out. Another big symptom is a sudden inability or difficulty in swallowing. It's like I've forgotten how to move my tongue properly or like my mouth is too dry, and I can only partially swallow. I have to push food to the back of my throat so that it's already partially down and then struggle to get it the rest of the way. I stop eating when this happens because I don't want to risk choking. Other symptoms are a tightness in the back of my head, confusion, and sometimes waves of tingles or energy washing over my scalp. The waves are very brief, but will repeat over and over for up to 20 minutes. When they stop, the rest of the symptoms go away too. I havent gotten too many of these the past couple weeks but they were nearly constant a month ago.

For the past couple weeks I have been having sporadic dizzy spells that feel like my body is floating or like my brain is swimming around in my head. Sometimes I get queasy during these spells. I noticed that they seemed to come or be worsened when looking at screens like my phone or computer, so I eventually figured it must be cybersickness. I am using my devices less and more carefully, and the dizzy spells got better for a few days.

However, now I am having very uncomfortable pressure in my head that seems to move around. It is mainly in my temples and the back of my head, but sometimes I can feel it in my nose too. It ranges from being annoying to feeling like my head has been put in a gentle hydraulic press. I feel dizzy when the pressure worsens.

Every so often, my right hand will feel slightly numb, and it feels like I've lost some fine motor control in it. However it's hard to tell if that is real or is just anxiety. It could also be carpal tunnel because I am an artist and it's in the hand I use to do most everything. It usually goes away in a few minutes to an hour.

I have been dealing with issues with my eyeglass prescription for the past few months. My old prescription had run its course and had started giving me trouble so I went and got a new one a few weeks ago, but it's too strong so I'm getting them bumped down a bit now.

Here are my ""crazy"" concerns - brain tumor, adult-onset hydrocephalus, brain cancer (cancer is of least concern because I recently had bloodwork and it came back perfect, so I shouldn't have that)

My more realisic theories are - sinus issues like infection or irritation, anxiety, eye strain from not wearing my glasses and having an outdated/overpowered prescription.

I was getting my prescription rewritten today and my eye doctor looked at my eyes to see if he could find any sign of a tumor, and he said everything looked good to him but I'm still worried.

What are all your thoughts? Do you think those strange episodes are really seizures? Should I be worried I have a tumor?",6.249762456980399,6.967285878834358,6.140172078407904,79.36457653748317,65.97852760736197,9.060362112823585,33.847224300463864,9.047159751262416,2.919516639233877,2731,117,498,44,41,858,295,652,0.159,0.7240000000000001,0.117,-0.9745,4,0,0,0,0,0,68.0,0,4,4,6,31,31,1,8,35,0,59,40,21,6,4,83,104,49,0,8,21,0,12,11,0,5,15,3,0,0,35,23,4,4,13,2,0,12,5,13,0,3,17,25,61,18,65,75,19,83,0,2,8,0,17,31,0,21,50,340,96,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055989708735390484,0.10158020137278924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06322837457993948,0.04582018025993143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03896374627347613,0.06008062503961994,0.08766369468427987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10201248793729614,0.0,0.0,0.10766434190654812,0.17623061761432385,0.0,0.10478267807138893,0.0,0.09751060697828427,0.0,0.0,0.0506743081287726,0.0625531976004133,0.06364375871253138,0.0,0.2558484327742105,0.0,0.0655322036491109,0.058417842485581226,0.0,0.0,0.09871213187383893,0.0,0.06191741817416264,0.06426316312137527,0.09149356519547663,0.19019325065211928,0.06293777567139754,0.036951655632093565,0.05907042044789398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11729127735752475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05862886658556719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048274972512729074,0.0,0.10298922625944452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20279666430033588,0.12279840210684068,0.0,0.0,0.05236818003641865,0.04873657562822,0.0692834423906978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2095462634741659,0.05496425152360638,0.032563056312236716,0.09611556994148313,0.09165087023450533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050667315725878716,0.0,0.051326622553569116,0.0,0.3528178965658161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056425744866382216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11960581553332675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3079152093760029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14434448678680012,0.0,0.06254615733415039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07649203436523799,0.058089898723527274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13720112763508552,0.12179472861222165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05533754609423778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06523271537823286,0.06012328763385449,0.0,0.07765150433180718,0.08715350148286567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16408865754946803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057599046629862566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06521623110147941,0.03670575719483258,0.0,0.056573615929013873,0.0,0.0,0.09786220148328052,0.054502318161861706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045658081535874966,0.1043215957689129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17000381531678108,0.0,0.0811098513823786,0.0,0.04575724856266045,0.09580527621834703,0.0,0.0598989904668257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2382129950718617,0.0,0.0,0.050079874011175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038065406426758944,0.03671343583465561,0.0,0.045487209449368966,0.0,0.0,0.054310607596905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09897196949246458,0.06310426150925169,0.09455161803725758,0.03379510027144677,0.04547948326595151,0.13787996015531684,0.0,0.0,0.05311464967299388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11637523631623435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,GoonerBoy-,2019/04/08,"Extreme irrational fears I’ve recently developed an extreme fear of having an anaphylactic shock.  This past month my health anxiety has been through the roof. Been through every symptom in the book believing I’ve had a brain anyerusm to a heart attack.

The last week has been hell. I’m eating one small meal a day at most, literally starving myself scared to eat. I’m convinced I’m going to have an allergic reaction to something. I’m even starting to struggle to use hand soaps or even touch certain objects as in my irrational frame of mind I could potentially touch something I’m allergic to. 

Is anybody else suffering with something similar? I have some counselling coming up and I have been prescribed citalopram, which I haven’t started taking as I’m scared to take it due to this fear of having an allergic reaction.",5.791534216335544,7.976233490066228,5.884387417218544,75.28675772626933,68.40397350993378,9.271743929359825,36.42439293598234,9.725611199111238,4.010986313465784,671,36,109,16,12,212,93,151,0.276,0.677,0.047,-0.9881,0,0,3,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,0,2,12,2,6,10,0,15,11,3,1,1,10,28,4,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,4,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,1,10,0,1,5,3,7,2,21,22,2,16,1,1,0,0,0,5,1,3,9,64,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10859787966522497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16149831092607494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15993864024154794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584726574382709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12228469558967045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1133423273913476,0.0,0.0,0.09155150182107323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2905180130177515,0.11858812820224905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875245279646724,0.0,0.11960617618640038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4792284073191543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067829866546483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15089526906778086,0.0,0.16822153035852588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11571514120175963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14333763793293108,0.0,0.11330993674184453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619476744186878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355154708089278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14016691304222256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842504878746996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3278598137617489,0.0,0.0,0.20095794300733194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.148405868180942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14754925780093692,0.2134702809994656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12260658271228868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11387056238138225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ImpossibleSouffle,2019/04/08,"Trying some anxiety research Hey everyone! I'm doing a project trying to really understand more of the perspective of people with anxiety. I am posting this on multiple subreddits to try and get the most amount of results. I would really appreciate it if you guys wouldn't mind helping me with my project, if this isn't within the rules, I'll one hundred percent take it down, but it would mean a lot to me to be able to get a more varied response to understand all kind of anxiety.

healthanxiety,meg177,2019/04/08,"HA relapse. Feeling helpless. Could use some positive vibes Hey friends. Unfortunately my HA has come back full force. After a brief time of stillness and calmness a friend passed away and at the same time I was dealing with a minor neck injury. Now my HA has completely spiralled out of control again. With obsessions ranging from Heart disease, to brain cancer and aneurism. This is my third or fourth relapse with HA. Feeling extremely anxious and so so hyper aware of my body right now. Every pain, twitch, movement is highly examined... google is my best friend and enemy right now. 
I cannot stop thinking I am sick. And that I will die. It’s horrible. Anyone who has had a bad relapse with HA can understand what I am going through right now. Just looking for some calming words, stories, anything right now. 

Much love HA community.",3.7850837553564496,6.801825178807949,3.7376938059992213,84.08563693026879,78.66887417218544,6.2019477989871445,30.074405921308927,7.5105763829236425,2.2147651733541096,666,32,112,10,17,203,105,151,0.19,0.557,0.254,0.8955,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,2,11,17,0,1,5,6,14,9,4,2,0,27,23,9,1,1,2,0,2,0,3,1,4,1,0,0,5,12,0,2,5,0,0,5,1,4,0,1,2,4,10,13,15,19,6,26,0,1,1,1,7,9,0,3,12,74,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17066398010851294,0.0,0.1056303446984964,0.0,0.1243161940828329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14193347520721009,0.116162062354986,0.126135573287529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585366758085988,0.0,0.0,0.16780262971670729,0.0,0.16864198743480818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13013181220322165,0.15839205365600864,0.0,0.16943574647103973,0.12061560436196415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15574460230106546,0.0,0.0,0.15678486196616026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12728140985084038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527691650065567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35014457321673603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08585549614514923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17901645411630238,0.0,0.1596117670536129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268591765472645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363448798598905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11105245314428208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16074713486155404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5160454093522086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12064319884211401,0.12629971591392455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967983538938562,0.0,0.0,0.17617807573877495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15726724462206762,0.0,0.13047435510598807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,ncockwill45,2019/04/08,"Started CBT therapy a few weeks ago Hi guys 

I started my course of CBT a few weeks back and one of the first steps my therapist has told me to take is to completely stop the excessive checking I do, whether that be prodding for lumps if I feel a pain, or taking tonnes of pictures of moles thinking they’ve changed etc. The therapist was saying that there isn’t really a magic formula to stop the checking you just have to do it cold turkey.

I feel I have reduced it a fair bit since starting as I realised a lot of it was mindless, but stuff like the checking of moles is still keeping me from stopping, has anyone got any tips?

Thanks

healthanxiety,misscatlady,2019/04/08,"Urinalysis came back weird and I’m freaking out 24(F) - I just went for my routine checkup with the doctor and had a blood and urine test. The blood test came back fine for everything, but the urine test came back with elevated leukocyte erasure, wbc, bacteria, and squamous epithelial cells. I doctor googled myself into a panic about cancer/kidney/liver disease, even though it seems very likely it’s a UTI. The only thing is... I have no symptoms of a UTI. Could this be dehydration? I definitely don’t drink as much water as I should but the day I took the test I drank a lot since I knew I’d have to take a urine test. Could it be an asymptomatic UTI? If so, is there any chance I caused kidney damage by not catching it earlier? 

Possibly relevant: I also have a sinus infection/cold right now. 

The doctor hasn’t called yet to explain the results (just got them this morning). I guess I just need talking down.",3.7816190476190457,5.8545304000000025,4.603428571428573,82.83790476190478,73.57142857142857,7.409523809523809,26.523809523809533,8.238735603445708,1.8256095238095242,720,26,134,12,15,232,113,175,0.094,0.86,0.046,-0.8355,0,0,1,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,1,0,14,6,0,1,16,0,13,15,6,2,0,29,27,12,0,5,7,0,0,1,0,1,6,0,0,0,7,11,3,0,3,1,0,6,4,4,0,0,9,0,15,2,14,13,2,16,0,1,0,0,5,4,0,4,7,89,22,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11226833315331257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09546873937894687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32384940834858283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14335197235628258,0.481699846867437,0.0,0.14421727646415444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22417698927589225,0.0,0.0,0.0905387268565182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4310795852717544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13752691656437566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927250327879545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12617179482168311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11228120857346734,0.0,0.15465334761396302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06858654678728751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11935296387945275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10320142542616964,0.10409601612498688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10677149549008264,0.0,0.16471521683342075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15826651767344035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989069201512105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278040767455401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161305080532205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459170159330589,0.1055543987752807,0.11283865738056813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09326763242947604,0.0,0.13793062040593773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15597637285699587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11583490608039215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301411987246967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,elektrixekthor,2019/04/08,"Anxiety Brain Eating Amoeba I´ve had health anxiety for about 8 months now, I´ve always wanted to post here but have always been too sacred. For me, everything started with a scan my wife had and in the wait I started searching for possible causes and then started getting her symptoms. At first it was pancreatic cancer, then lun cancer, the stomach cancer etc. I have gotten help and have actually been partially hospitalized for my anxiety. For my regular health, got an abdominal ultrasound and all clear. At about he 6 month mark I started eating persistent headaches and that’s when thins got really bad. At that point I was convinced I was dying so I went to my Dr and told her about the headaches. Although I suffer from migraines and have had bouts of persistent headaches in the past, she recommended a sinus x ray and a head mri just to be clear and so I could calm down. Although the mri is this coming Wednesday, I have been relatively stable for about 3 weeks, until yesterday that is. Yesterday I was cleaning out my lawnmower and accidentally got a little bit of carburetor cleaner in my forehead. In order to make the sting go away, I went to the hose and but some water in my forehead, however, some water went into my nose and now I can´t stop thinking about the brain eating amoeba. I live in PR so weather here is warm and I really cant function right now due to fear of the brain eating amoeba. Any advice would be appreciated.

healthanxiety,gasolinedrinks,2019/04/09,"Does anyone get health anxiety about a loved one or pet? I can’t live like this. I have everything I’ve ever wanted and all I am is constantly scared to lose it. My mom got breast cancer this year. It was caught early and is hopefully treatable. But it’s sent my already anxious mind into a tailspin!!!! I can’t stop reading sad stories and looking over at the love of my life, laying in bed next to me, and imagining him withering away of cancer. I freak out if he has a headache (or myself). Ask him to check his testicles all the time. I’m trying so hard to live in the moment because I’m so scared of the mortality of life but it’s causing me to panic about living in the moment.
Does this make sense to anyone? Like I feel this urgent need to get married, book plan tickets, just anything to start ticking off the things I want to do “in case something bad” is about to happen.
I find myself in these deep dark holes.
My beloved rescue cat, she’s only 4, I found a black lump on her chin. Immediately googled and found cat skin cancer. Couldn’t sleep. Was in a full-on panic, cried, lamented the unfairness of losing a young pet. Turns out it was cat acne. Lol wtf. Seriously.
Oh and I have this tiny black dot under my toenail, my doctor brushed it off but referred me to a dermatologist (for unrelated reasons) and said they would look at it. Well, I’m convinced it’s subaungal melanoma. It’s sunny out so I walked around the house barefoot today. The black dot just looked at me. I googled. Melanoma can spread as quickly as 6 weeks. Well TOO BAD MY DERM. APPT ISNT FOR 8 WEEKS. That’s just great.
Okay, rant over. I’m so tired of living with constant anxiety that some kind of ball is about to drop.",2.022117647058824,4.275648976470588,3.198823529411765,89.93970588235297,79.82352941176471,5.764705882352942,22.94117647058824,6.923569853693429,0.7035294117647064,1332,44,273,15,34,429,195,340,0.201,0.674,0.125,-0.9827,0,0,1,0,0,0,50.0,0,0,1,3,17,22,0,4,16,2,18,15,4,3,3,43,45,19,1,7,9,1,3,2,0,1,9,1,3,0,18,13,0,1,7,4,1,3,4,11,2,1,9,11,31,11,49,34,3,42,1,3,6,3,13,22,0,5,18,161,49,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10798212595304432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497130391821025,0.11054491849863393,0.0,0.13684080071557447,0.0,0.08052386645506122,0.08710903446759988,0.09147842002316063,0.0,0.09193518420836523,0.0,0.16340468164380792,0.059649676886215725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10052096854290933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.211486519854047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1074858378837643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001556782770124,0.17126190621055742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08851274491080767,0.0,0.0,0.08794307678820426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04947691623040901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943496413109397,0.0,0.0,0.21457935596115132,0.0,0.0,0.10224727275545577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07826119111172278,0.10788218614691723,0.0,0.0,0.08653020902027649,0.0,0.08765618060158539,0.0,0.0,0.10401211054939513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09718912461067956,0.0,0.11290808133643952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101897810234069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13823153656372394,0.09561109849117587,0.0,0.3456204692032353,0.0,0.246513130479634,0.2189427385687448,0.0,0.0,0.17663051831129548,0.0,0.06531697631091966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09880263532895964,0.1146030911223616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0725560253174161,0.0,0.0,0.1040667224273562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663070542055408,0.07442086276054201,0.0,0.2296164999893912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09787848984779994,0.0,0.0,0.10060816320520984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307966911352918,0.0,0.19593386427020576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09792267725544224,0.0,0.0,0.07533125768701883,0.0,0.0,0.06926015611022447,0.0,0.0,0.08180866163573655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500852724011369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0570582937635871,0.11246649054294756,0.09275226366448493,0.0,0.0,0.06643509141459958,0.10643488764633212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11543130116347902,0.0,0.15698195968508386,0.0,0.17596141655618855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06951126018261243,0.0,0.0,0.0630134860454023

healthanxiety,MyHealthAnxiety,2019/04/09,"I am going to start tracking all my anxiety symptoms so I can go back and laugh at myself later When this shit is happening it’s unbelievably taxing mentally, but after it’s over it’s laughably stupid.  

For instance, today 4/10, 7pm. Was eating trail mix and a protein drink and had a twinge of nausea. Since I’m on lisinopril I can’t have a ton of potassium so of course I freak out and think my potassium is building up and that I’m gonna have a heart attack.

healthanxiety,WeighDown5252,2019/04/09,"Reinforcing Anxiety by going to the doctor Recently I have been thinking about whether or not I should go to the doctor for the bigger  problems I can't seem to shake. I was told a while back I had a lesion in my leg that was most likely benign and then that was it. I didn't hear anything back from any doctor about it and I didn't know where to go or what to do about it and my HA went through the roof because of it. 

I recently went to my main doctor and asked him about it. He told me they can't legally say 100% something is benign because they can be sued over it, but reallistically it most likely was benign. He said that I could always get an x-ray if I needed reassurance to make sure it hasn't changed ar all. 

My question is this, what do you guys think you would do in my position? 

I have had enough radiation in my body already and I want to avoid it as much as possible. And I feel like maybe not going and getting the x-ray can teach me more skills that I need to cope. I know something is there but I still have to live my life. And trust in my faith of God.

I appreciate any advice.",2.480952380952381,3.7331402337662354,3.9734415584415568,89.4325432900433,75.23376623376623,6.864935064935065,23.222943722943725,7.3871296695380915,0.709694372294372,858,24,194,10,18,285,124,231,0.031,0.815,0.154,0.9806,0,1,2,0,0,0,17.0,0,2,2,1,9,14,0,2,8,1,27,7,2,1,2,36,50,18,0,8,8,0,1,3,0,2,5,3,0,1,16,8,0,1,7,0,0,7,7,3,0,0,14,4,32,11,27,32,7,21,1,0,0,0,16,7,0,7,10,140,48,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145149222503745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12932005832105042,0.0,0.09750994417637188,0.0,0.0,0.15938394665268552,0.0,0.08964862836128189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09643587782975496,0.0,0.10955511857265078,0.0,0.0,0.18022093640115294,0.0,0.14287363997837188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13016963733694795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12396954397632134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09356521708557257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4797882257513546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12108670472550608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059253859247451066,0.08371925119426152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12245196285220115,0.0,0.266402947688372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11603471139335104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13207958319572768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288071056561058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08277346927769587,0.1717566595937627,0.0,0.1034793000226421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07822401264405429,0.0,0.1177312667035161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614678789941707,0.17378708453419425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321120524575224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11213325091795058,0.0,0.0,0.13127756880990668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2314183579754387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11147278433376974,0.09319273540535153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668370758071903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804343552509711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09358662296866076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11044846221347218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15017889341125465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22395663452262726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06912061818928744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2172692130407223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08324711281100422,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Galaxygirl181,2019/04/10,"I don't wanna eat [Trigger Warning] I do not know if this is the right subreddit for this; if its not then please redirect me to a proper subreddit.

I do not think know if this counts as an eating disorder or not. I think about not eating sometimes although I have not acted upon it. The reason why I don't want to eat is because of my periods. If I don't eat I will not get my period. I have really bad anxiety when it comes to menstruation. This post I made explains why.

https://www.reddit.com/r/menstruation/comments/af32dw/i_wanna_talk_about_menophobia_my_story/

My period is the main cause of my anxiety. I'm tired of being ashamed and embarrassed about this. I'm tired of being not like everyone else. I just don't want to put up this anymore. I'd like to add that I haven't started to starve myself, these are just intrusive thoughts. Although, I kinda want to stop eating.

I'm not calling this an eating disorder is because it has nothing to do weight or body image. As you can see, this is very complicated. If I do stop eating, I'll take everything into consideration.

The only way for me to be happy is without my period. I'll eat when I don't have my period that month or whatever.

I want to try to conquer my fear of sex/menstruation. But I know I can't do it. People on Reddit say that I should try to learn about what's going on in body so that I won't be afraid. I definitely can't do that. I'm a loser because of this.

I blame myself a lot for being this fear. Its all my fault. I hit myself from time to time because I feel so stupid. I have not told my family that I think about not eating anything. I feel too guilty to tell someone. People already don't understand why I feel uncomfortable about sexuality and menstruation. Life sucks.

Again, if this isn't the place for this let me know.",2.895289132602194,5.2256885621469005,4.570588235294121,80.83824526420742,77.22033898305084,7.441542040545032,22.8411432369558,8.405096225971981,1.4859035559986715,1437,44,279,29,34,483,154,354,0.199,0.784,0.018000000000000002,-0.9946,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,0,1,0,2,13,13,2,5,10,0,38,16,2,4,1,59,69,21,0,12,24,0,4,2,0,3,3,1,0,0,26,5,11,2,16,0,0,4,23,10,0,0,3,6,44,3,40,56,3,29,0,1,1,0,6,8,1,11,17,195,70,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07794437005019572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080668529569755,0.0,0.07004814585889263,0.0,0.0,0.058124268155037975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05897492229185136,0.17222689209195832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569128643091449,0.0,0.0,0.07212335574391003,0.0,0.0,0.07255870821917003,0.0,0.06084337124221536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16190120144423192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7227435630171751,0.05900412536774025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06749207749772032,0.06347965147040448,0.0,0.06658573579775669,0.15896168502925295,0.1071412615810833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036902400253446085,0.0,0.040141897178732906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07518927194237955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15527040180308846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222619234337742,0.04988959952138404,0.06901463344908168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06004895594720815,0.0,0.06683387913714027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0563779344043961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06777348431354767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05371895779293071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09793492420168448,0.0,0.07379559768479063,0.07753292621815717,0.0,0.0,0.06764610654024943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07100485240816046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045248784913006115,0.07262164764516083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060319498144743626,0.0,0.05616954669469325,0.0,0.0,0.05628470487589204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059846419237881136,0.0,0.06985703480454182,0.0,0.04999382249555963,0.0,0.0,0.11810333496526845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05310661114786164,0.0,0.061735640967001126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13577475211983786,0.0,0.05607406341578248,0.08237238754635623,0.1623626073251839,0.0,0.06749207749772032,0.0,0.0959092313442666,0.0,0.0,0.07353059322525801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05827894797313814,0.16664276562167726,0.05606453901311727,0.0,0.08601097017428831,0.0,0.0,0.1912036764083656,0.0,0.0,0.06808690366012073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Alternative_Pride,2019/04/10,"How do you cope with bad stool anxiety? (Gross?) I've been struggling with this particular health anxiety for some months now.

I've been suffering heavily from health anxiety for 9 months now. But this isn't some muscle ache or dizziness I can just ignore.

The stool keeps going from having weeks where it's too soft, to weeks where it's semi back to normal. Sometimes I see small red...bits? in it. 

When I went to my doctor about it the first time, I performed a couple of feces tests. I got a slightly elevated white blood cell count on one of them.

Then like 2 months ago I cried hysterically because I started dripping fresh red blood after a visit. 

Doctor discovered that there was a small hemorroid near the opening. I've done more tests much later on, so far they've come out negative, I have one more test I need to do that is quite time consuming. 

He assured me that it's way too rare that it can be colon cancer (I'm 20 and have no history) and that he sees no real reason to worry.

But I'm relapsing again two weeks after feeling fine about it. I got a very small amount of blood. I know it's much more likely that it was a tear cause it hurt quite a bit coming out. But it awakened the beast from it's slumber...

I just don't know how to ignore stuff like this and carry on. It's not like a muscle pain which can be anything and ignored. It's too visual and clear to my eyes.

TLDR: How do you deal with a visual symptom like finding something bad in your feces?",2.22195526695527,4.315504979797982,3.3663143338143366,89.82026515151517,78.32659932659934,5.993698893698895,21.38155363155364,7.021680442328713,0.5225210197210197,1157,32,238,13,28,373,161,297,0.157,0.758,0.084,-0.9722,0,0,1,0,0,0,36.0,0,3,1,4,19,17,0,1,13,0,19,12,5,5,2,40,35,15,0,2,7,0,2,5,0,0,7,0,0,0,25,13,0,4,5,0,0,5,6,10,0,4,8,7,19,7,30,25,9,41,0,2,5,0,9,15,0,3,25,148,44,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096156228935523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489484224724159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08926539124395083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08341030724374429,0.1811435972981764,0.06612513754285357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2368524380864471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11143334243905627,0.0,0.18688260552547006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200251328805067,0.11915430535408705,0.0,0.1118325972018956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22205679384981492,0.0,0.11100722473021113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0548480404541484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914386150975768,0.09226847870565257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0616486412762421,0.0,0.1735141679443398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2306069529704567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11612435236141695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09641724971651756,0.0,0.0,0.11922965746930254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26497616451520656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2597502832402377,0.0,0.1594826925270838,0.08043257573429724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10628212199954222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14701045532121065,0.0,0.1154246716658635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307522774392847,0.0,0.12346789558118865,0.0,0.11153000279563496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17288049763982535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835090822928058,0.10728419885368004,0.0,0.07677891294808414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113401252655474,0.1241775176510279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11274669167806155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12650487714375636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10596396742630478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950294355933522,0.0,0.08610212513245857,0.2610354544515979,0.0,0.0,0.10055708385619752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11016126877502913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,fsckingrootfs,2019/04/10,"Recent onset of HA, Trying to nip it in the bud Hi all.
Back in November I had a rather large health scare. I had a real symptom that I was dealing with for 2 years, I thought it was just something simple so I kept putting it off. I never had HA before, and was so laid back I let this issue go on for 2 years.
Finally saw a doc about it and immediately was ordered a CT scan. I got afraid it was serious. Went in for the scan and had to wait 12 days to get the results back since it was over Thanksgiving. I was... not myself these days. Pretty much mortified as I was finally coming to terms with my mortality, wishing I went earlier, etc...

Thankfully, to SO MUCH RELIEF, the scans came back clean. The issue I had was very real, however. Docs knocked it up to a really bad cold I had that did some damage on my body. Annoying, but manageable. Thankfully not the big C or a brain tumor. 

I am healthy.

Since then, however, I've been shook. It's been some time now, but since I've had more HA than I ever had before. My family line is healthy, I'm relatively healthy, etc. 

However, I've been over analyzing myself and have thus far 'induced' two issues. The main one being over-noticing my eye floaters and oddities I had my whole life, that I literally never had before. Eye things seem to be the big thing right now with me, I don't know. I DON'T have visual snow, but am afraid if I think about it too much, I might get it. 

I have an eye exam scheduled soon. I was due for a standard one anyway, but I don't know why my mind is in 'something is wrong with your eye' mode when my eyes have been like this my whole life (And I have had many normal exams).

I really want to nip this in the bud, before it gets too bad. 

I think it's still 'young' and I can overcome it and beat it before it consumes my life. I need to. 

I'm looking for self help methods right now. Guides, meditations, even books. Please do not suggest therapy at this time. It is something I may consider in the future, but I am not in the right place or mindset for it right now (Had a traumatic experience with it in the past. I need therapy for my therapy. Ha.) 

But any advice on self-help that I can do right now would be really appreciated. I've been listening to positive affirmations on youtube which has helped a lot. I think I can get over this, I just need direction.

Thank you so much.",1.7784226397587588,3.74830115448852,3.637742519137092,87.94070099744845,79.20876826722338,7.264040825794479,22.753003943400607,8.238735603445708,1.2466091486893993,1819,58,393,36,45,612,219,479,0.061,0.818,0.121,0.981,3,0,4,0,0,0,73.0,0,2,0,1,26,19,1,4,22,4,56,12,7,3,4,63,88,24,1,9,16,0,0,1,2,3,5,1,1,1,31,15,0,2,8,1,0,7,9,10,0,3,35,12,51,9,45,46,15,66,0,1,10,0,11,27,0,9,32,270,82,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06935717789101482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04826628933473416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2183054452646961,0.11852442153662315,0.0,0.0,0.3019778396426465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07883862221072291,0.0,0.07923297721069357,0.0,0.08117793088658573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06113976161879575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0915476294100696,0.07317340546392198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15831457884263206,0.04687914903067293,0.06420208884859517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06942839962189717,0.06691009933818927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15550204274261095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832866151845606,0.0,0.04033744308256015,0.0,0.05676619734496793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544444327821077,0.0,0.0,0.14272166891104413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222423194934752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07801339043906177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07257803261636951,0.1503978901753346,0.03467541452040506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05960218091133643,0.0,0.0,0.0603414764355223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07195878547037447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07529459347657222,0.07166578754570603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20870286511712155,0.1578839879598249,0.10948253146856682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695416631753474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619069863176163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06775486941324647,0.0,0.0,0.07415508310680474,0.0779106175381811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07220837083399811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07135074308638255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16157304061943678,0.13640762502005424,0.0,0.07008049215741645,0.0,0.0,0.3030666827166378,0.0,0.0,0.07105961618860811,0.0,0.0,0.06461411962164379,0.14808743292783974,0.0,0.0,0.1761368822532864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16392297303530556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05668173134034949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0737715084089521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19603620727769105,0.2435026100720402,0.0,0.09430694406758773,0.1364361607349309,0.0,0.05634722074472194,0.08277365365745805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04818822019317878,0.0,0.06933349083409636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058562846103432424,0.04186363591296632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13159140453467752,0.06404503321436478,0.15848491474711188,0.08161919394045873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05041949729068883,0.07760139610769695,0.0,0.09141276623662027
healthanxiety,TootyFruitti,2019/04/11,"lived in Vermont apartment for over a year, possibly with dangerous radon levels I'm a 28-year-old male, reasonably fit, moved to Montpelier, VT over a year ago. Yesterday at work I overheard two women talking about a tunnel that was cordoned off due to dangerously high radon levels. I did some research, and apparently Montpelier is a death zone with abnormally high levels all across, with the average being a whopping 3.4.

I'm an introvert and spend a lot of time indoors, horribly afraid of cancer and now I'm convinced I'm going to develop lung cancer. Haven't had the radon levels in my apartment checked, and I can't afford a contractor to do the job right. I heard the free test kits require around nine months to get an accurate reading, and I refuse to wait that long and potentially jeopardizing my health. I have a shitload of work to do and I can't concentrate. I don't feel safe in my house anymore. Is one year of exposure to potentially elevated radon levels enough to develop lung cancer?",6.763270944741535,7.769420331550805,7.209425133689841,71.1302161319073,64.93582887700535,10.939215686274512,35.904188948306604,10.864195022040775,4.229463814616756,810,38,138,22,12,265,110,187,0.165,0.79,0.045,-0.9742,3,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,3,3,6,2,1,15,0,13,6,2,1,1,20,22,7,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,2,2,11,0,4,2,1,3,2,4,3,0,3,4,2,11,4,27,17,4,32,0,0,0,0,5,20,0,2,10,83,13,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15487761957605206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17327404006647626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15553671960913654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18053116192491525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0883430437943402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128332951089828,0.0,0.09929668536985448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1857178485946032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36919987947316896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2016019658094512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17338138821752264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15427984691311375,0.15462058531597989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485396233000464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13945882999574566,0.18569836827893074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18333792498883647,0.0,0.11839393882744732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19696912545856046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17476601967027222,0.0,0.0,0.179639962335472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14920884785982086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404323036160318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187990135264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17067481969186835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543946447426526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4500525563411413

So, how often are you guys buggin the docs?",3.0162244897959205,3.865266948979592,4.6802040816326524,86.4433673469388,73.38775510204081,7.2326530612244895,21.142857142857142,7.447530270364453,0.5126367346938769,363,7,80,4,7,123,69,98,0.022,0.884,0.094,0.7622,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,3,1,1,12,4,0,1,6,0,11,0,0,2,0,16,17,10,0,3,4,0,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,2,2,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,2,3,11,3,8,10,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,3,0,4,6,54,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15243595947742836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17623228882342545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4069404311396732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590956147446536,0.2204811676692565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16788801293915684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2015071296066072,0.14235381640307135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3946041983520435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.224584339547074,0.0,0.0,0.21053272778594795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20797922464443455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624262704716942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09735003453817816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20018687322375528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15905014885019672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19244983831406373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2122090231549973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381441554791697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15819288569430354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13528677205513304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15983708417097856,0.0,0.1791617317388384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14155100582165445,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,n3xtup,2019/04/11,"Here’s my story (LONG) Hey, I’ve been suffering from health anxiety for years now (4-6yrs). I’m 18 now. It all started with me having a tight throat feeling which I have because of GERD (I didn’t know at that time), and I searched it up on google and all my symptoms matched thyroid cancer, etc. I got panic attacks, laying in bed for hours searching on google at age 13.  It became so bad that I never went outside. I used to either tell my friends I’m sick, or just talk to them over the phone to something. 2014 is when I developed my first real disease, called Visual Snow, symptoms are where you are tiny dots over your vision, like pixels. Luckily I’ve managed to ignore that and accepted it as a part of me. 

At age 16 I dropped out of high school because I was unable to wake up in the morning and get ready. Since I dropped out of high school I developed BDD (Body Dysmorphia). It became so bad that I never went out in daylight. I checked the mirrors every 30 minutes, hated my face, etc.  Now I’m 18 and have noticed 4 months ago that my tongue twitches in the mirror (fasciculations). I even read ALS patients never feel their twitches in the tongue. Just like me. At this point, I take it as it is. My life will just be anxiety, diseases, problems etc.",3.612147368421052,4.999578640000003,4.362378947368423,87.22213684210527,72.6,6.703157894736843,28.35789473684211,7.0608816371341465,1.4031999999999996,980,38,198,9,19,314,150,250,0.147,0.779,0.07400000000000001,-0.9694,0,0,1,0,0,0,41.0,0,2,2,1,12,12,2,1,7,0,12,13,4,1,5,28,26,11,0,1,5,0,3,2,1,1,9,0,1,0,14,9,0,2,4,1,1,2,4,8,0,1,6,3,29,4,33,18,7,43,0,1,0,0,10,22,0,1,19,124,43,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077360130618588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18595231802890147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382669043218547,0.0,0.0,0.2029581357404787,0.14817674862875665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13500120549664146,0.0,0.0,0.1241037822202767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.406640648811494,0.08027463512593931,0.0,0.10240092063029632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229064256824758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10338007362680232,0.0,0.0,0.09389987821241708,0.0,0.06349853521403656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09720495942391796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11999351182980368,0.0,0.12918910180036305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2568229234555489,0.0,0.0,0.11969034720929582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0667940500406224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08584581139073612,0.11875455532031688,0.0,0.0,0.1075572148179532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701039034006692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2812125576517919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13837170198665136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14259853605261272,0.0,0.13161369933938996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11489259776988793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11629535396949155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12157078749986736,0.13833673552209186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24600568197760395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100537404848168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09356581139131832,0.0,0.0,0.08602514948664176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25264882331136396,0.09138137343127783,0.09768755833217324,0.1062294795184268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086972548334604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10496972100760532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22533369745725265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07826642128994445

Jolted wide awake. I’ve watched QVC, twitch streams, parks and rec. I’ve done calm.com, YouTube sleep hypnosis and chatted on Pacifica. I’ve read my book and meditated. Nothing helped tonight and I’ve literally slept zero minutes. My alarm will go off in one hour and I’m horrified about what tomorrow will be like. 

I have four children who need rides starting at 7am and ending at 8:30pm. I have a job where I have responsibilities to my coworkers. 

Please tell me that I’m going to be alright. Sorry to whine I’m just really discouraged.",2.364074911204394,5.0994481779141125,3.1754213755247034,87.57644817565388,82.55828220858895,6.621762996448176,25.143364546335164,7.85451343220497,1.6230196319018404,675,27,131,13,19,213,116,163,0.166,0.774,0.06,-0.9493,1,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,1,6,2,13,10,7,0,1,17,22,9,0,3,2,0,0,1,0,4,3,0,0,1,4,10,0,1,0,3,0,4,0,4,0,3,5,1,12,3,16,11,1,32,0,2,1,0,5,14,0,0,15,67,16,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234849348177528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14369694853612808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13735550378202566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10410176763757524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16518746864076164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14296913895659197,0.0,0.0,0.10661559039565006,0.0,0.13600229503290934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18347603991208147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081956143817616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31792999151872764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16018324471819625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0788610686786994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196899896749598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4544418072478735,0.0,0.1548856853666751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093815516839396,0.0,0.17176097661674036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17718936155363976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16146247521185242,0.0,0.10340901215638504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785076723958473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3230707354316717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18069512320556552,0.2285061049982579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410871398980671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412459629035497,0.185527156882906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2293345584230416,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,FullBodyChills1,2019/04/11,"One side of my face is doing some very weird things - swollen gums, a lump in my jaw, ear ache and now I’ve woken up and I can’t hear out of my ear, could it be a Tumor? I’m panicking so much that I’m not sure how I’m going to make it through work today, I’m shaking, I can’t think straight. At first I thought it was my wisdom tooth coming through as the swelling and pain was around that area and I could feel the crown coming up, then the swelling went down but the pain remained, then I felt pain in my jaw and noticed there was a large lump on it that wasn’t there before, it felt a bit like bone. That’s still there and it still aches, but then yesterday my ear started aching and I’ve just woken up this morning and it still hurts AND it feels full so I can’t hear out of it. I’m scared there’s a Tumor growing in that side of my face which is causing everything to hurt, and is blocking my ear canal. I’ve booked a dentist appointment for the swelling gums and everything and I’m going to get a doctors appointment ASAP although there’s like a 2 week turnaround at the moment. I’m so worried guys what is happening to me?",1.9969999999999999,3.489038033333337,2.9058333333333337,95.6025,77.0,5.966666666666668,23.666666666666664,6.508806274219699,0.4021916666666665,888,28,206,7,20,281,116,240,0.206,0.746,0.049,-0.9899,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,3,15,12,0,2,14,0,15,18,10,3,1,35,41,23,0,2,4,0,4,2,0,0,8,6,0,1,18,17,0,1,6,1,0,7,5,8,0,2,10,10,15,4,25,28,4,38,0,2,0,0,3,18,0,1,15,125,33,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11480159332968055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10973532039069696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407907384203365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13247727313589922,0.0,0.2221749562083392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.205927867778501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13199585459178267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.231801566836457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041193375648694,0.0,0.2476433284789808,0.0,0.0,0.10969316891851956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737619064246862,0.0,0.14658169108184854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12769051069305434,0.11403875530698145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29069421085929703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27610833900861165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260065217560256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608169058238885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09480031629632793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14682162574538574,0.0,0.0,0.08738652102297051,0.0,0.4116670671508285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911129105573674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912784342555606,0.0,0.3089624700421684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12154311736504148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08567518343871529,0.08263225445528069,0.0,0.10237970324022017,0.0,0.0,0.12223884375136836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10640536881375308,0.0,0.0,0.10344380009496308,0.0,0.0,0.11954705810832734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938842950538832,0.13096497128306306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,enemybird,2019/04/12,"Neti Pot Anxiety I was recently diagnosed with a sinus infection and told to use a Neti Pot.  Being careful to read the directions, I took off the nasal cap and washed it with soap and my bathroom sink water, then poured distilled water over it to rinse.  However, as usual, my anxiety about this kind of stuff has flared up- wondering if the hand soap I used was not appropriate, if I poured enough tap water to rinse that soap off, and then if I poured enough tap water off with distilled water.  As I looked things up I became even more scared, reading that tap water with Neti Pots can be dangerous.  I haven't touched the thing since, and my sinus headaches are becoming increasingly easier for my anxious mind to read as some kind of horrible brain amoeba like you can find stories on.

Any advice on how I can put myself at ease instead of feeling like I will be waiting the next couple of months before I know if I have gotten a more serious infection?

healthanxiety,TimberFrog,2019/04/12,"Should I be worried about a possible auditory hallucination? Hi guys,

Today I was on a empty street waiting for my Uber when I heard a baby cry for about a few seconds, twice. I did not hear this sound again, and it sounded like it came from one of my houses, as some of the houses had their lights on. I did not see the baby though, and I have not heard this sound again. 

I am worried this might be the onset of Schizophrenia, yet my psychiatrist said I do not have any of the positive/negative symptoms. Does Schizophrenia develop that rapidly or suddenly, or is it  more gradual. I did not hear anything throughout the day, so naturally, this has me worried. Should I be too worried or was it likely a baby from one of the houses crying?",6.610996503496505,6.392310265734268,7.224606643356648,75.10306381118883,65.22377622377623,9.9472027972028,33.95891608391608,9.516144504307137,3.0604132867132874,580,23,109,10,8,192,82,143,0.124,0.858,0.018000000000000002,-0.9129,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,1,0,9,2,0,0,11,0,18,1,0,0,0,16,26,9,0,2,8,0,0,2,0,3,1,8,0,1,9,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,4,10,10,15,2,14,10,3,11,0,0,1,0,8,3,0,5,9,91,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936992033944733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11338613607034227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15759047488680514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.302702897326094,0.08886056983670984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.120577455207604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13642980051631712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3105896670279302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4769596259141182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346305573814628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14616916953647938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18673471609237308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1553330098049764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310660365939954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10979760104186008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14321240904162766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13537404327129826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306050150307025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5597134762730769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,electricmeow33,2019/04/12,"HA and a Palm Tree lead me to urgent care To preface, I just discovered this sub and WOW, I can’t believe there’s so many others who struggle with the same issues I do. I’ve struggled with HA since I was about 14 (I’m 24 now), and I go through periods of time where I’m fine, and then I’ll hit a rough couple of weeks that leave me absolutely crippled. 

So, couple of weeks ago (after many years of worry, I am a former smoker) I finally got the reassurance that I did not have lung cancer due to shortness of breath. Following that positive news I thought to myself “okay great, finally my HA will calm down.” That was short lived. A couple of days ago I was attempting to clean palm tree debris and got stuck by a leaf/thorn. Naturally it lead me to google it because it got slightly swollen and I convinced myself I had a serious infection and Plant Thorn Arthritis (Thanks Google) So off to the urgent care I went, they laughed at me when I demanded a Tetnus shot and gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way. 

I still can’t stop thinking about how I might have to get surgery to remove plant debris, it’s been consuming every thought of mine even though the swelling has gone down. In other news, I’ve had a slight tenderness in my thigh for a few months and my googling has lead me to believe I have a DVT. I’m freaking out and scheduled another doctor’s appointment for Monday.... 

I luckily have a very supportive SO that recognizes when I’m on my bad weeks with HA and is my safe person. It just sucks so much, we have so much planned the next few weeks and all I can focus on is my impending death.  

But hey, I’m so happy I found this community and I’m looking into getting professional help for my HA and trying to figure out better ways to handle it.",3.7919295958279022,5.014010983050852,4.820000000000004,84.75606258148633,71.93785310734464,8.158018252933509,27.45719252498913,8.617729084823388,1.8852493698392008,1384,49,284,24,26,453,191,354,0.076,0.7120000000000001,0.211,0.9943,0,0,1,0,0,0,35.0,1,0,1,6,20,27,1,2,16,6,23,10,5,4,1,42,52,28,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,2,5,0,1,1,16,22,0,2,5,0,0,9,3,6,0,0,18,2,40,21,42,31,6,51,0,0,1,0,9,15,1,1,25,179,56,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894409926201388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11204676788318363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.089219448544409,0.0651378066295693,0.0,0.0,0.24077795152337644,0.0,0.09450455012412476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21789155598504092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3546990230995935,0.0,0.06891262497316243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10937060425165496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07057670934855284,0.0,0.09002993287992332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341088245132327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11716097491992415,0.0,0.0,0.1116546380267952,0.0,0.06072815004468043,0.0,0.2563850769699573,0.1178079974082306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11374911773443082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07162264356152967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115288417996984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11314399971875437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09435490879994947,0.0,0.08973127468604293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21666836502917566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11335625217591967,0.0,0.0,0.08529062900228843,0.0,0.15710141668680666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11364148803315073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09330165069098792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08839154721158145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533452848222872,0.08933555151384062,0.0,0.2234160605635371,0.0,0.0,0.1212577698806316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09837771311205372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06846835931628707,0.10498447953010624,0.16966184341345336,0.06230800064307755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254752018584634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08816655279646084,0.0,0.16963302567464228,0.3428504920086435,0.0,0.0,0.0990556409688145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851642340835267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881110650289189
healthanxiety,lolygagging,2019/04/12,"How to stop the feedback loop? I finally got over my own health anxiety. There are many 'problems' I have that I don't really worry about anymore. yay.

In exchange I am now worrying about the health of others like crazy. Some people in my life either have or died to cancer and right now I only have my mother left of my family. Not a day goes by where I am not building up a scenario in my head where she will die soon. It doesn't help that she is the type of person to never see a doctor, so I spend every waking moment trying to find a way to make her get her appointments.

The thing is I really want to stop, somedays I tell myself how unlikely all of this is (even looking up global statistics) and that I should just stop and go on.

But then it's my fault if she dies. That is all I ever think about. Because I didn't make her go, so it wasn't found and I will never ever forgive myself that. So I go right back to 'I need to worry'.

How the hell do you get around that thought?",2.4070631067961155,3.6223519757281535,4.038046116504855,89.04357402912622,75.35922330097088,6.897572815533981,21.127427184466022,7.413659706084162,0.5583796116504853,761,17,166,9,16,255,119,206,0.173,0.78,0.048,-0.9767,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,0,0,21,6,1,0,9,1,18,7,2,5,6,36,33,14,3,5,7,1,0,1,0,3,5,0,0,1,12,5,0,3,5,0,2,3,8,3,0,0,5,2,30,3,24,25,5,33,1,0,2,0,12,14,1,3,16,127,42,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09193592470157964,0.0,0.11918439164194675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698399654955293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240954792890296,0.0,0.07325945999953043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07750493843604901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741777114488301,0.0,0.0,0.1230073872899083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07937650779097133,0.21741596044555994,0.1012552403565751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11329322590598667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13164924452014554,0.10984061472486184,0.0,0.0,0.13176909386070498,0.0,0.0,0.12557620392107047,0.0,0.20489996712711686,0.0,0.0961174125167771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233374115661179,0.25548742088898063,0.0,0.0,0.08055285344340435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13057386743208252,0.0,0.084885352714324,0.05871295379174212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10091934421360947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16043964236278602,0.12184174016855062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911054530279419,0.1853775333337191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09140086758452104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08331636917978559,0.1049348895881265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499422022823053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15397834835650534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052628974651481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09576639363007626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3014228418781256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10504096462595497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07984099578712124,0.07700527988438617,0.0,0.0954079947892518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08159304754218552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07088416259496802,0.09539178936192054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3661401108508074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,TurtWorld,2019/04/12,"Love Yourself Good morning Reddit users! I wanted to pass some words or love and support.

We are all here because of our health anxiety whether we have it now, or we had it in the past and we’re just trying to support others.

I wanted to tell everyone...

Breathe.

Why is that so important? Because when we are all trapped inside our own thoughts and obsessed with our problems we feed into our pain, our stress, and our anxiety. That’s what our anxiety wants! Take a moment to step back and relax, let your body unravel since it’s so tense you won’t even notice it! Close your eyes, take deep breaths just to let your mind go back to normal. Because if you continue to worry and stress, your symptoms of whatever you’re feeling get worse! Then you begin to analyze “new” symptoms and you’ll start to worry about those. So just breathe please.

We as human beings sometimes forget to love ourselves and appreciate the small steps we take against our anxiety! Please give yourself a pat on the back, congratulate yourself for taking this small step! Don’t ever feel like you’re alone, we’re all here to help each other because we want the best for each other, we might feel like we’re in a hole. But we can get out of here I promise you all, we just need the support and the love because with that we can counter attack the mind. It’s powerful, but we can’t let it take advantage of us! We gotta control it and use it to our advantage!

healthanxiety,FairyAlyra,2019/04/13,"Gallbladder removal worries I had to have emergency surgery this morning to get my gallbladder removed.  The surgery finished around 11, they’d sent me home (unwillingly) by 5. 

Thing is, they told me pretty much nothing about what to expect. The most hey said was no lifting.

Apparently they put staples in, so now I’m kind of freaking out that I’m going to move wrong and pull them out.  Not to mention being worried about how painful it is.

Anybody have any advice to help me out?",4.989904761904762,6.854664022222224,5.026507936507937,81.925,69.8888888888889,7.365079365079365,35.079365079365076,7.957251820313856,2.7612698412698413,382,20,68,5,7,119,70,90,0.18600000000000005,0.7559999999999999,0.058,-0.8999,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,4,0,6,4,0,0,2,0,8,1,0,1,0,9,15,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,3,0,0,5,1,9,1,15,8,2,14,0,0,0,0,10,5,0,1,2,46,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22600848898915604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1572813579410342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20589219677579396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12083657987154485,0.0,0.13144428360538232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15502509241500573,0.0,0.2319971623988918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24084716498079106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458187692186837,0.170020683608794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.221923668763582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2461029629107623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2352994351962347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325047547140163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22000447675811066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15365511240518331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22100220465979545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4697611741452587,0.0,0.0,0.2528732398153368,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,theNoseOfTychoBrahe,2019/04/13,"An Arrow To The Knee Hello everyone! 

Recently, I have been going through a bout of health anxiety due to a nasty head cold. Lots of dizziness and headaches have been fueling my worries, making me feel very disconnected and depressed. I have been constantly worrying that this will never end or that something more serious is going on.

Earlier today, I was starting to have a bit of a panic/anxiety attack so I decided to go for a drive and clear my head while listening to some music. I ended up driving to a park, watching the sun set, and taking a walk, which really helped me regain focus on reality and calm down. Luckily, on my evening stroll I found a fence with some graffiti reading “Let It Be” which reminded me of a lesson my old therapist gave me. I think it could help a lot of people on this sub.

She used to compare any condition or small symptom causing worry to being hit with an arrow.  *cue Skyrim guard life story* Going ahead and excessively worrying about the first arrow, to the extent that many of us do, is like shooting yourself with another arrow.  I am already suffering from a sinus infection, why would I then exacerbate my anxiety by worrying about it more than I should? This could extend to anything we worry about, a headache, a sore stomach, etc. Don’t let a small, insignificant symptom we are dealing with create more issues, just let it be and it will pass. That headache you think is brain cancer, will go away! That leg twitch you think is early signs of ALS, will go away! Don’t take an arrow to the knee from life and shoot yourself with another.

healthanxiety,BlitheWillow,2019/04/13,"Looking for some advice I just know how ridiculous this is going to sound and I would like to apologize in advance for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since Rachel Star Withers' face was eaten away by flesh-eating bacteria, I have been living under the constant fear that I might end up with the same fate as hers. I know how rare necrotizing fasciitis is (0.0004%) but I just can't seem to get my mind off it. I have, because of this, become a germaphobe and was compelled to wash my hands with soap after picking up anything from a surface that I consider just a bit unclean. As a result, my overly dry hands are now cracking and it's creating small, tiny wounds on my skin, which only made the situation worse cause necrotizing fasciitis usually occurs with certain types of bacteria entering wounds on one's skin. I understand that the best thing to do right now is to stay away from this irrational hand washing habit of mine but I simply can't do it. To make things worse, I always feel like I have touched something dirty when in reality, I haven't. For instance, when I walk pass a trash can a bit too close, I feel really uncomfortable and go straight to the bathroom to wash my hands. I only came close to touching it, but my mind is telling me that I have, indeed, already touched it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been going through hypochondria for quite some time but now I really feel like I'm going crazy. Has anybody ever experienced this? Can some of you please give me some advice on this. From how to deal with the flesh-eating bacteria craze to how to stop being a germaphobe. It can be anything. I just want all this to stop.

healthanxiety,fabtastnic,2019/04/13,"My fingernails are giving me so much anxiety!!! I have not been this anxious for so long. I've dealt with health anxiety in the past about many different things that seem so much more serious and like more confronting (for me) like stroke and heart disease since those are two things that have been in my family. But within the past two weeks I have been incredibly anxious about my fingernails because my two thumb nails have ridges in them, almost like lumps. Of course I googled, I know, I shouldn't. I did though, and it was filled with kidney disease and all these terrible things and now I am unbelievably anxious. My therapist cut us back from weekly to fortnightly visits and now to monthly and my appointment got delayed for another two weeks even though it's been a whole month. I don't feel like I want to share this anxiety to him because I am embarrassed. I feel silly that I am so anxious and paranoid about my fingernails, but the reality is that I can't stop thinking about it even when I'm not directly thinking about it. I'm constantly checking google to see if I can find something that maybe says it's ok and it's nothing to worry about but I can't and it's making it worse.

healthanxiety,DConner777,2019/04/14,Can anyone help to calm me down? I’m 22 year old male. Been trying to give up alcohol but drank the past 4 days due to social circumstances. Had a lot of drinks (~20)  yesterday over the course of the whole day and woke up feeling awful. I finally threw up less than an hour ago but there was some blood in it. Now I think I’m going to die and just need a rational perspective to help calm me down. I had a doctor check up about a month ago where they said I checked out healthy but I have had no tests except an EKG when I went to the hospital for a panic attack about 2 months ago.

healthanxiety,jijiheart,2019/04/14,"Woo! Heart Woes. I’ve been dealing with bad heart palpitations since I was about 12 years old; my parents always told me it was anxiety attacks, as they run in the family.
In early February I had a bad anxiety attack with palpitations, which triggered about a 3 week period of time where my heart was just fluttering constantly, while I was laying in bed, trying to sleep, doing nothing, etc... I seriously felt like I was going to die, which then triggered a super intense depression like I’d never felt in my life. I finally gave in and went into Urgent Care once I had enough, where the doctor did an EKG and measured my resting heart rate at about 136 bpm. They urged me to go to emergency, so I did, and $1,000+ later they told me I was totally fine, my heart likes to jump around a lot but palpitations are normal and they recommended I start meditating. I don’t doubt the constant fluttering was probably due to health anxiety since I felt so scared from it. I took their advice, started meditating, got a breathing app, and decided to find a heart rate app to measure my bpm when it happens, since I’m never able to get into emergency when the palpitations are actually happening. It’s been giving me a little peace of mind to see what’s going on when I feel them and sometimes it’s not so bad as I feel like it is, my heart rate is usually 90-110 bpm, seems okay enough. It also helps me just to have a visual of whats going on. Anyway, after a couple more weeks of meditating, drinking lots of water and pulling myself out of my funk, I seemed alright again and convinced myself it’s all in my head.

Today I was shopping, bent over to pick something up, and it triggered really intense palpitations. My heart was pounding so hard that my entire body was shaking. I kept trying to calm down but had no luck- I remembered the heart rate app and pulled it out to see the severity of the situation. The app couldn’t even measure it for a minute, I watched the lines squiggling all over the place extremely tiny and just bouncing everywhere. Finally got a reading of 210 bpm, and so I sat and tried to calm down some more, and it finally slowed to about 160bpm, then about 10 minutes later I was back in the low 100s range. Now its been a couple hours and I’m comfortable in the 90’s. I’m super tired now but I feel like I handled it like a champ this time. It’s weird to experience a feeling like your heart is going to blow up but to have doctors tell you you’re fine. What a fun time :) Anyway, my sister says she knows of a cardiologist, I’m going to see if they’re accepting patients. I doubt I’ll get in anytime soon, since all the doctors in my area are booked out for months, but it is what it is I guess. Reading posts on this page and how other people deal with it has really helped me through all of this, so thank you everyone who’s shared their heart related stories! I don’t feel like there’s any advice I haven’t tried yet, but I still wanted to share my experience and get it off my chest!",6.921264969252343,6.017658282608696,7.4034599201639875,76.34161020606322,64.8361204013378,10.72616247707412,32.8354730823174,10.011982343527217,2.9767800625741714,2375,81,473,45,31,784,277,598,0.09,0.74,0.17,0.9941,2,0,2,0,0,0,66.0,0,3,7,3,33,40,2,4,30,2,35,24,16,5,7,76,80,40,1,4,11,2,9,8,0,0,6,2,1,0,31,26,2,1,15,5,1,13,8,14,0,0,31,15,63,26,73,48,15,88,0,3,4,0,26,34,0,10,48,304,94,7,0.050541601686949655,0.0,0.04932131253276925,0.0,0.0,0.09877733644394253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040418100608875886,0.042054661406837036,0.0,0.0,0.034370022292496936,0.0,0.11599256085620775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044992740943197065,0.0,0.11499673668285583,0.0,0.03886337195037661,0.12660037885347045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0561403256857018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05153053134102226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109235032381293,0.0,0.0,0.11184664189996377,0.0,0.0,0.10421234412992472,0.043531407473635306,0.0,0.05245420306122694,0.0,0.0,0.15519441287288918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04951152826448999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444597032873176,0.056367245949988425,0.033382251245032225,0.0,0.0,0.048294666324637615,0.0,0.0988787692456713,0.04764612398309645,0.0,0.12777676209067912,0.14442772137538545,0.14558359080307084,0.1660975625822403,0.04619410830355521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07921770256124941,0.04848410973876879,0.1723437418221686,0.0,0.08084547186447077,0.0,0.05567727236873275,0.0,0.08938754291113347,0.0,0.04527534772922038,0.0,0.05187026458325005,0.053723359161382434,0.0,0.6588124548209557,0.06775394047904555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049773296831277285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02777634251007405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0356990279642292,0.19753658903465535,0.05065596264550156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08593732473892911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05103260991274694,0.0,0.04034182427151664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07796159802377244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04952003865509436,0.04849602993316364,0.0,0.053034908957932385,0.05382515629716443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056120467478054034,0.0,0.0,0.0350391828285978,0.0,0.05280521653129646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048404883426985616,0.0,0.05449239494081255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10111055792430818,0.0,0.06475648846467168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05725378221489207,0.0,0.0,0.04019271025281431,0.05060096034233888,0.0,0.12082533870380817,0.09202235193198502,0.0,0.05709762381129181,0.0,0.16723414079178192,0.0568108779062305,0.050578102227239664,0.0,0.0,0.03890939421786301,0.04998693641380201,0.0,0.07154721162043844,0.0,0.04036258839444643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044175587585663714,0.04653191635500385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08841364316536361,0.058090136169187935,0.047907528724859066,0.09658933264927523,0.05615357914090118,0.1372577196302864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055664433794472515,0.0,0.029810746162708974,0.0,0.08108284850170709,0.0,0.0,0.04685257111844186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03254713441489333

healthanxiety,Krs1218,2019/04/14,"How to give more power to positive thoughts, automatic negative thoughts causing panic attacks I have been suffering from constant automatic irrational negative thoughts for 7 months now. I have had a checkup on every part of my body including 3 heart checkups, I am literally completely fine. I’m a healthy young adult that used to go gym a lot. Since, my anxiety has heightened I’ve stopped going gym in the fear of something happening and I get regular panic attacks. I feel like I’ve been getting better each month but currently my senses are heightened a lot to what’s happening in my stomach and back. Any new sensation, it causes me to panic/worrry and bring those thoughts in which makes no rational sense. However, when I am anxious now, I am really forcing myself to say positive things such as no “I am fine, I am safe, I’ve been through this e.t.c”. But it’s the constant negative irrational thoughts mainly about negative heart connotations or that this person will have to save me or if I go to this place something will happen that constantly pop up and making me excessively panic. I have practiced meditation for a few days now and I’m listening to positive affirmations everyday
So, there’s two stages left of my anxiety now that I need to get rid of.
1) extra heightened sense of awareness for any feeling in my stomach or back(I suffer from heartburn and GERD so there are constant sensations). I have been trying to focus on different parts of my body
2) how can I give more power to my positive thoughts which should lead me to be more excited rather than constantly in state of panic due to these automatic negative thoughts

So can anyone help? Every day has pretty much been a struggle in this period, I’m a college student so I’ve fallen behind in my work so much. Annoying thing is, I have so many Entrepreneurial goals but in this period I have only lost money and not had any chance to gain so now I’m broke and unable to try anything",6.48038374205268,7.5621115558583165,7.093096049046324,71.44474852406904,65.59400544959128,10.803315168029068,36.000113533151676,10.775791032727817,4.255826612170754,1579,76,267,43,24,520,187,367,0.197,0.675,0.129,-0.9746,5,0,2,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,8,21,20,3,6,9,0,30,9,6,8,0,42,61,26,0,4,9,0,2,1,0,3,3,2,0,2,18,9,0,2,9,2,1,6,8,13,0,1,15,4,30,7,44,42,13,45,0,4,0,0,7,13,0,6,25,188,48,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14920618024102228,0.0,0.11189859190174567,0.08262353626289308,0.0,0.051138808611570455,0.0,0.060185187075426964,0.0,0.0,0.16640687316222902,0.0,0.11247505613377977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468337600447578,0.0,0.16247654194624758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502628615116096,0.0,0.0,0.07668232969066062,0.39517339149537295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09433410828875208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07641217675472971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232414733995588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08229900397018111,0.07396012115002534,0.05224879897745517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463255882354348,0.14031857481197052,0.12469563925452312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19402335159107872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1733344374006551,0.04902191881597378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07946312582508998,0.0,0.0,0.035730846657679394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07983723432787876,0.12435623749194827,0.0,0.0,0.09763849182944558,0.07414902935916694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675386673270748,0.0,0.10752762690306124,0.0542298594121176,0.0,0.07063578040538095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05562367711264282,0.0,0.4290501877222537,0.0,0.15839961326826227,0.0,0.0,0.06386005483923063,0.07641217675472971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07440621147159389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04685317633008313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058161156829447815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060499348194289336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11260824985473494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06114546930859203,0.0,0.0764582500625064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717740952311944,0.0,0.0,0.4064360159218615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09930989608881237,0.0,0.07144382737737429,0.0,0.0,0.06316653697882123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05324431312578811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Vinegar_Doppio-,2019/04/14,"Having a severe panic attack, might be triggering  As  of today, I've suddenly begun experiencing a sweet taste in my mouth.  I'm a long time sufferer of health anxiety, and intrusive thoughts  compelled me to start self-diagnosing what the issue could be. While my  family has no history of Diabetes, and I eat well, I saw that it could  be an early symptom for type 2 diabetes. Since I've seen that, I've  convinced myself that that's exactly what it is, and that my life is  over. I'll just have to live with a future of crippling health issues  from here on out. I can't get it out of my mind, and the fear of that is  overwhelming me. I'm hyperventilating, and I don't know what I can do  to put my mind at ease. I know it's probably nothing in reality, but  this idea claws at the back of my mind, going ""What's wrong with looking  out for your health? It's better to catch these things early"" and it  compels me to look further into it, which further perpetuates the cycle.  I'm so tired, and scared, and I don't know what to do.

EDIT:  Since I've now read that additional symptoms are excessive drinking and  bathroom visits, I'm obsessing over that and am afraid to do either.",5.485347985347985,5.596634897435899,6.762759462759465,76.34692307692309,67.54700854700855,10.104517704517702,30.38949938949939,9.957137785484203,2.789842246642247,922,32,183,20,14,314,131,234,0.129,0.818,0.053,-0.9556,0,0,1,1,0,0,30.0,0,1,0,1,6,13,1,6,9,0,21,13,1,3,1,35,36,14,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,1,9,0,0,0,24,17,3,0,5,2,0,4,4,9,1,0,3,7,18,4,31,27,1,29,0,2,4,0,2,13,0,1,12,123,42,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09323320919999603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386491693432048,0.0,0.09371351560446572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10778757130532242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19461280373922046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12369945539171052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11939003600973605,0.0,0.12470743797000952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148918778608182,0.13714203411675813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06367408893051227,0.0,0.06926375285194168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886388085565288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13758081225726934,0.0,0.2544094008657945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20093614449434705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608314838099454,0.0,0.0,0.10761689724911476,0.10785457709145167,0.20468678292920234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12928896120100133,0.36917372672922255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11694130565148055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14299277668956048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13140069035005747,0.0,0.0,0.12251694349645735,0.0,0.0,0.12190689294684408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201704712338457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12714107006979605,0.13768283068308373,0.0,0.20163071905728192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08626298229100259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25334731879233885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08096761181354363,0.0,0.0,0.09675427278739937,0.07106565825017724,0.14007613362288235,0.11552221836183114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10957928347814858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13324999083278558,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,zntra,2019/04/14,"Please tell me if it’s something serious Two months ago, I went through a bout of a bad common cold and it was gone late February. In March, I was definitely fine. In April, however, I began to have runny nose, coughing with phlegm on the first day, but now it’s dry without a sore throat. It is really unusual for me to have a cold twice in two months, and I think it might relate due to me having Rhabdomyolysis in 2017, and I think I might have either lung cancer, throat cancer or leukemia... :(((",9.371632653061225,6.1509650408163274,9.13642857142857,73.19607142857143,61.85714285714286,12.657142857142858,35.724489795918366,10.686352973137794,3.3899714285714286,386,11,80,7,4,126,66,98,0.153,0.773,0.07400000000000001,-0.9008,1,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,5,0,9,8,4,0,0,13,14,6,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,5,4,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,2,0,4,5,3,9,1,13,7,1,19,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,4,12,53,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.192683158073675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1814927684801516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14018404387904554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18489266961145176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24519998817307465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4611850973658839,0.0,0.0,0.34700130152303826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23860422160564634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392511753315036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16734010767832655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18998876060487568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785606118025134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4246728914339445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20150183403182065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20953449639770186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,millennial_unicorn,2019/04/15,"Failed driving test &amp; I think I have a terrible disease or cancer My health anxiety had gotten better, but since February I thought I had lymphoma (skin itching for no reason, no rash), which then turned to thinking I had ovarian or colon cancer (constipation/tenesmus, heartburn, and bloating). Then today I woke up feeling how you feel when you have the cold/flu (lots of fatigue, body aches, headache, maybe slight fever, not sure?) 
Also my period started, so I’m feeling extra crappy. And to top it all off, I failed my drivers test for the 2nd time. 
I have a doctors appointment tomorrow, and I don’t even know where to start. Or if I should just ask to be referred to a therapist. 
I guess i just needed to put it all into words. I just want to go to sleep and wake up somewhere different, living a different life.

healthanxiety,ridiculissa,2019/04/15,"Severe Hypochondria after Being on Accutane Hey everyone. Most of my life I have never thought twice about a physical symptom and was confident in my health. However, that changed when I went on Accutane to help my cystic acne in August 2018. I started experiencing physical symptoms such as an increased resting heart rate all the time (around 100 or more bpm when it used to be around 75), stomach issues like indigestion and weird bubbling/gurgling coming up my throat and noises in my stomach when I sucked it in and out which I later researched and believe is succussion splash. I was feeling very anxious about how my body was feeling and felt like I was changing, like I wasn't the same person. I know Accutane is associated with horror stories so that just fueled my anxiety. I stopped the medicine at only 2.5 months instead of completing the full course which was supposed to be 6 months. I was so concerned about my symptoms that I went to three doctors, got an EKG, echocardiogram, different blood tests, and capsule endoscopy. Doctors said everything was normal. Cardiologist agrees that my pulse was a little higher than normal but still in the ""normal range"" and that it's nothing to be worried about (diagnosed it as ""inappropriate sinus tachycardia"") I haven't been able to do things normally since then. I have had better days where I forget my symptoms but it has been bad lately. I went on a trip recently with my mother and I was incredibly anxious the entire time because my symptoms were heightened. I never had trouble with trips so the fact that I am unable to handle things the way I used to is very concerning. I haven't been able to eat normally as I feel nauseous often and have lost weight without trying. I have also felt dizzy and numb? Half of me is saying there is something is terribly wrong with me and that I need to get more tests done and second and third opinions and the other half is saying that my anxiety is what is actually causing the symptoms. It's a vicious cycle. I never used to be this way. It started when I took that medication and my mind is telling me that I will never be the same because of 2.5 months on an acne drug. Meanwhile doctors told me that I am 100% healthy. Please give me advice on what I should do.",6.363178740690586,7.524991556872043,6.4779045362220735,75.46309241706166,65.8957345971564,8.872173324306026,34.02877454299255,9.04235418022936,3.100416790792147,1815,80,307,30,28,579,215,422,0.105,0.8240000000000001,0.071,-0.9478,2,0,2,0,0,0,40.0,0,0,0,2,22,13,2,0,18,0,46,24,6,5,6,62,71,32,0,7,5,1,6,3,0,2,16,4,0,1,26,24,2,1,7,0,0,8,8,9,0,6,28,11,48,4,44,35,9,52,0,1,0,0,10,18,1,4,27,236,74,6,0.14456473136783662,0.0,0.07053716205090081,0.0,0.0,0.07063349118166219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057804181722530025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11059162380532477,0.1633169977308522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869326042026566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06035275610964014,0.08812531844050836,0.0,0.0,0.0814374736783762,0.0,0.06392787848328373,0.0,0.0802894133819264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07425390065138207,0.15293031718785527,0.06226485771863562,0.07578668519003165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04661614609521143,0.0,0.0,0.0733650796373326,0.0,0.07551968762238924,0.0,0.2219521924307303,0.0,0.07396995599598698,0.0,0.0,0.08382459606103942,0.07396290540702395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906889800371413,0.06496272948286086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10964440779561198,0.0,0.13880481289037672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03776455272522308,0.06933983160454171,0.0,0.0,0.05781081095719912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07683277464620243,0.0,0.08565495136146485,0.048449346071054236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544401022583594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03972449783271029,0.0,0.08153765688969923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05105517252606437,0.10594053824953037,0.07244591967409876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07890474075133187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07281687893599563,0.0,0.0,0.07298458395453666,0.0,0.17308528402472914,0.0,0.0,0.05359645826809548,0.22299446592774044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541068568542757,0.06935687933990255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497399627076344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06311417365438203,0.0,0.07934433153390882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07137011590329853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06875708226059514,0.11496367678715075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816584988654261,0.0,0.05979271983909407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05564649650035758,0.0,0.0,0.10232366093274364,0.0,0.05772479060611532,0.06043129430183961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4507743262146211,0.0,0.0,0.06317797358197692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09604238385585216,0.0,0.0,0.057384124334434565,0.08429685741935943,0.0,0.0,0.06906889800371413,0.08030836788798322,0.04907498156028401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872862681090972,0.0,0.1192810434219157,0.0,0.114748754825425,0.0,0.08802044842032122,0.0,0.20101943146507734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06967762111706266,0.0,0.0,0.07340625102154556,0.0,0.0,0.07902941979950112,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Decyphed,2019/04/15,"Chest pains, like usual. Howdy! I’m 18 and I suffer from severe Cardiophobia  :( I’ve gone to the ER before and had an EKG done, it obviously came out normal.  
Wednesday I saw a new primary doctor and brought up my issue with my chest pains, they did an EKG, chest xray, and blood work and everything came out normal (besides my LDL cholesterol which is 11 points high) yet I still can’t get over this??? 

My rational part of my brain thinks it’s chest inflammation and purely muscular issues but my anxiety forces me to believe it’s a heart attack.


I also have shortness of breath sometimes (like right now) and I’ve been slightly dizzy lately.

Is there any way to cope with this? 


(FYI I have very tense shoulders and I believe I have GERD, I’ll be picking up my prescribed pills for it tomorrow)",2.591446078431371,5.12410054248366,3.409963235294118,87.64670955882353,79.52287581699346,6.177941176470588,23.28799019607843,7.413659706084162,1.0775754901960783,625,21,120,9,16,198,104,153,0.149,0.84,0.011,-0.9581,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,1,5,6,1,0,5,0,11,15,10,1,2,21,19,10,0,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,7,14,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,9,1,16,2,14,9,1,22,0,1,1,0,1,9,0,0,10,68,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11791384235054173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002694666283281,0.0,0.11279705815460785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1677430022165772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254671006695888,0.3322460467940742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646003551089946,0.0,0.3372816905620974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15091893035963294,0.0,0.15089015137096487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13251645148567762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703531792657599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17472618987775582,0.0,0.15578655076485515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3077941028821647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16632738555621138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1440709599598371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.142405871151227,0.0,0.0,0.2889348060995845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31378941725521936,0.0,0.0,0.15967144971025174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13938570026505173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12591949804993802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665738892044004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14582950834135033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11775189365918418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09447850839076533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16239276888563678,0.121659763449068,0.0,0.1170370912899925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073436543209616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,pak_satrio,2019/04/15,"Is this shingles? Please help me So for a few days I’ve had aches on the right side of my upper chest and under my right shoulder blade. Last night I decided to use nutmeg balm to try and soothe the ache. This morning when I woke up and checked myself in the mirror I had this [rash](https://imgur.com/a/z5TaEWc) on the right side of my back on the shoulder blade.

The rash doesn’t hurt when I touch it and doesn’t seem irritated. The only places which hurt are where my muscle ache is, the rash does not cover those areas at all. If it’s shingles normally does the rash itself hurt when you touch it? I’m confused to whether it actually is shingles or maybe just a reaction to the nutmeg balm. I’ve used it before and never had a rash afterwards but after I applied the balm on my back last night I was sitting on a bare mattress, duvet and pillows, maybe it could be a reaction to that also?

Please let me know if you have had similar experiences or if I should go see a doctor. Right now the rash doesn’t give me any pain or irritation, the only pain I have is from the aches on my chest and back that were there before the rash",5.765203224722876,5.474096235807863,6.017117903930132,83.29774269398725,66.99126637554585,8.96755122606651,28.53241518307021,8.384062270229773,1.7454451461202558,894,25,187,11,13,286,115,229,0.194,0.772,0.034,-0.9873,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,2,0,0,12,6,0,1,21,0,20,13,10,2,2,28,29,20,0,6,10,0,2,0,0,1,3,0,2,0,14,7,0,0,3,0,1,1,5,6,0,0,7,3,20,0,20,18,2,37,0,3,1,0,4,20,0,8,15,126,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.11593429568456655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500647461246464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08078990851056647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27405582436603143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021846914126969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09485428723366768,0.0,0.0,0.0766179118629309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12159959543279962,0.2079300831117597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621183502605825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139663732736796,0.06751831104292133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07963094416914894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815422358100287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06529085582341686,0.19368011039579236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12148380776256948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23870655647740305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09162796459769997,0.0,0.0,0.22297656818384967,0.11640141977033736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807096104608749,0.25282889362125105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241235334716498,0.2608193730932498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4058274196215527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09467036881313304,0.10815351427827244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065923348062963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20521477335073085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I know this is weird, but I had a meeting with my school's CBT counselor and she talked about how a good way to get over health anxiety is to just accept the fact that any of us could just drop dead at any moment. Honestly, I feel like this is probably my best hope for getting over my health anxiety and panic attacks, but I have no idea how I can train my mind to think like this. I really don't want to die, but I want to be able to have this mindset so I can stop constantly thinking about random heart attacks and strokes.

healthanxiety,froshizz,2019/04/16,"How to handle being home alone? A couple months ago (around Christmas), my girlfriend who I live was out of town for a week, leaving me in our apartment alone. I had been fine with this in the past, but this time... It was really the first time I had any health anxiety, and it hit HARD. I felt like I couldn't breathe, felt like I was having a heart attack, worried about having cancer; all the fun problems.

Since then, I've gotten on SSRIs and have improved a lot, but my girlfriend has to leave for another week soon. I think I'll be okay, but I'm still a little worried that my anxiety is going to come back in full force. When she's home, I have the comfort of knowing that she could take me to the hospital if anything awful happens, but I feel very vulnerable when it's just me, especially at night. I don't have any family or close friends around here, so I can't depend on that either.

Does anybody have any tips for how to feel more safe when you're on your own? Thanks in advance.",3.9170071428571407,4.853710515000003,4.5544285714285735,87.85400000000004,71.35,7.314285714285713,25.785714285714285,7.447530270364453,1.114071428571429,773,23,163,8,14,247,126,200,0.168,0.6779999999999999,0.153,0.1181,0,2,0,0,0,0,29.0,1,1,0,2,14,11,1,0,10,2,20,4,2,3,1,31,34,15,0,4,8,0,5,2,3,0,2,0,2,0,9,8,0,1,6,0,0,3,3,2,0,1,9,5,21,9,23,20,6,35,0,0,0,0,8,16,0,4,18,110,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11344515519299893,0.0,0.0,0.26509411154643703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26108916008189004,0.13419654105032824,0.19580629520023424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053153422834852,0.22785586894437004,0.0,0.14559393811837154,0.0,0.09840751196999743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11024208426957502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10218036155165586,0.14160569707678233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11199478531469187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12064667271222485,0.0,0.12941947766119322,0.0,0.2457587223411198,0.0,0.0,0.10885838600433816,0.0,0.0,0.09887581648575593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07273309024743907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11317090177131148,0.0,0.11464353451620338,0.0,0.0,0.13603508507940934,0.0,0.15165505410399052,0.0,0.0,0.2567455972534576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033359744319287,0.0,0.0,0.2710213545594822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12504759156488954,0.12826800661440368,0.11300729714286363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088026834587853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10215116073715616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200990857611246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221698911765612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1224580723227488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08198625844740201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10586507864508678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10220373841050803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622385120849432,0.0,0.0,0.11782534262695613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08200340951571299,0.0,0.0,0.14925050180439095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055956065948416,0.0,0.0,0.2053131517944857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2599366129639051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Anon8782,2019/04/16,"Scarlet Fever Hey guys, I’m a 20 year old male. I had a bit of a sore throat waking up on Sunday but nothing too serious thought not too much of it, as I was settling down for bed I noticed a bit of a rash on my chest which sent me to immediate panic. Fast forward to Monday and I have a full body rash and getting a lot of chills in the nights and when I wasn’t medicated in the day, I was pretty worried something was seriously wrong with me so organised an appointment with the doctor today. I went in and the doctor did a few tests on me (Checked my throat / tongue, Ears, chest, back and my blood pressure) and then told me “I’m sorry to tell you this but I’m afraid you have scarlet fever” I had no idea what it was until looking online after but surprised a 20 year old like myself has got it as it’s usually only children who get it to my understanding. I asked the doctor again and she confidently said that it was scarlet fever. I’m on a set of antibiotics for 10 days now and have been told it should hopefully get a lot better within the next two days.... has anyone else ever encountered it? And do you think I should trust my doctors opinion, I always have a fear that it may be something worse.

healthanxiety,Mattimuss,2019/04/16,"Anxiety at it again over mice this time. What do you do to ease your mind? I’ve had health anxiety in the past about rabies and amoeba. Each ‘episode’ is weeks apart sometime a good couple months. Since Monday it’s been about hantavirus. Which I might add being in Australia, there hasn’t been any cases as of yet and to my knowledge don’t have deer mice which are apparently a more common mouse to carry the virus. Nonetheless, on Monday when I went into work there was some little black things on my desk that I thought was dried glue from work however turned out to be mouse poo. I only picked the one bit up before being told it was mouse poo, then slid the rest onto paper towel with an aid so I didn’t touch anymore with my hand directly. I then tossed it in the bin and washed my hands, I could have touched my forehead prior to washing but I can’t be sure. Anywho, ever since then when I googled mouse poo originally just to see what it looked like and it lead me down a health anxiety hole so to say. There is some mouse poo around my area as I work near the kitchen, however I didn’t notice until I accidently picked a bit up off my desk with my bare hand. I know it’s unlikely to get Hanta, I have posted in other threads however it doesn’t ease my mind. How do you ease your mind when having anxiety over some disease?",4.905711150131694,5.359120589552241,5.132115891132576,86.34651009657594,68.8507462686567,8.246180860403863,25.839332748024574,8.124751697461798,1.3096274802458296,1050,27,221,13,17,331,154,268,0.026,0.884,0.08900000000000001,0.9542,5,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,4,0,4,16,3,0,0,11,0,28,9,4,5,2,32,36,17,0,1,2,0,5,1,0,1,4,1,1,0,16,12,1,0,3,0,0,3,6,0,0,1,11,9,28,3,36,19,8,44,0,0,3,0,6,21,0,4,20,147,44,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0890841273285129,0.0,0.4008569239995491,0.0,0.12991626716494933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11661729599510764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11147089485395983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28603497111027143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045924120643634,0.14494841468953698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11849651457728436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844181286414405,0.0,0.0,0.1098761347384652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784926077335013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07199387919594097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06399972081719058,0.1312958771995145,0.0,0.0,0.11000655626413712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13896972907732064,0.3968163430926192,0.0,0.10456252194089556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14914375742906955,0.0,0.0,0.08876862674591247,0.09963099503743744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12505381078865688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546127441624486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417603129170433,0.0,0.0,0.10438961183479234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21672821980132675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295618190280175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12346544401368187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703022263650673,0.0,0.0,0.10399894122000213,0.07638684062419478,0.0,0.0,0.1251756012125503,0.0,0.0,0.1424897988219009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10507986783676654,0.0,0.0,0.12143781507219553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2861075088256665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,bigbluemelons,2019/04/16,"Nausea So recently my fear of throwing up has come back, im pretty sure it happened after a night of heavy drinking and that lead to me getting sick. So ever since that night ive basically been in fear of it happening again, so for about id say 3 weeks now im basically just always nauseous, i feel horrible but eventually forced myself too eat. In a huge twist that no one saw coming after eating I actually felt better, so my brain was like a-ha! I did it! I know its just anxiety! I can fix it!...but we all know its not nowhere near that easy, its still a challenge for me to eat, and at least 3 nights a week im up laying in bed praying for it to go away and begging God to help me even tho im not religious in the slightest. Im actually up right now writing this feeling nauseous yet strangely hungry, and yes i know if you’re really hungry sometimes you feel nauseous, but the nauseous i have most nights im fairly sure isnt that. I know this is probably written horribly but i haven’t been sleeping well as im sure you can imagine, but basically what im looking for, is has anyone else had anything like this, and what did you do to help yourself? My family is pretty worried as ive also lost some weight and obviously they know im not eating.",1.6807335907335919,3.727578571428573,3.8951876447876437,85.58832586872589,79.88803088803091,6.615042471042472,25.031814671814672,7.699297019823105,1.4051456679536676,986,38,202,16,25,339,143,259,0.12,0.7,0.18,0.9519,0,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,1,3,1,4,19,11,0,2,6,1,19,9,2,1,6,39,38,19,0,1,10,0,5,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,17,9,6,0,10,1,0,5,6,3,1,1,10,8,23,8,27,28,4,33,1,1,2,0,9,12,0,3,18,128,40,2,0.0,0.0,0.1403138463652061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057492581482287974,0.05982050148867338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054997733324957464,0.0,0.0,0.05026906077682846,0.07366258659636336,0.0591615821545538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06754557614881362,0.055281063307631634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06358326773541127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08025605085435444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123858423359584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07042749486436008,0.0,0.29425679866497817,0.060057141727617426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04748446292267771,0.06503108035290665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06777405727006908,0.1617985926842042,0.10905335671950976,0.0,0.06902828461044799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037560978462061655,0.0,0.04085828902730735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12714898812417955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09637634834532996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6989082612293078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19755179127463526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07024630221189912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060371777391763325,0.0,0.07847939546589262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26986578687909824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04871636705369591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14628148242752892,0.07751251070941444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04605631676744845,0.0,0.07098538689929114,0.0,0.0,0.061395989287865015,0.0,0.05717197578296063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059470400150251825,0.0,0.07194463915210539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07110373747224903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057413618333023934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20327411078131946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153360055043432,0.08754596384054393,0.0646401884305339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301054599170224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,seesawincolour,2019/04/17,"Department at Work Is Passing Around Stomach Bug and I'm Freaking Out So as it says in the title, a department at work has been passing around the norovirus for the past week or so and I'm terrified that I'm going to get it. 

I interact with this team almost daily, even though I don't sit near them, but it's all I can think about now! I'm very good at washing my hands throughout the day and I'm not touching my face, but I feel like using the same bathrooms and just breathing their air will make me sick.

healthanxiety,Auxient,2019/04/17,"Losing my mind over my palpitations... I have had heart palpitations and severe anxiety for the last 6 years. Today is my 25th birthday and I am overwhelmed with stress about these palpitations. I’m 5’10” and 210lbs, so a tad overweight. I have been to several doctors and a cardiologist over the last 4 years (the cardiologist visit was just about 6 months ago) and no one can seem to find anything wrong with my heart. My blood tests come back great, my echocardiogram results were immaculate. I even wore an event monitor for a few days and it recorded a few “episodes” that my cardiologist told me were no cause for concern. 

But I just can’t shake the feeling that there is something seriously wrong with me. I can go weeks or months without noticing a single “skipped beat” or “flutter”, and other times (like today) where I have 10 or more in a day! They scare me. Some are very light and feel like a small jolt. Others feel like a big flutter or thud and usually make me jerk or gasp. Sometimes I feel out of breath from them. I do go the gym every day and never get them while exercising, which is a good thing. I have never fainted or passed out or anything either. They don’t hurt. They just scare the crap out of me and I cannot get it through my head that there isn’t anything wrong with me.",4.060298804780878,5.829561832669327,4.395336653386456,85.90312450199205,72.10756972111555,7.251075697211156,26.494223107569734,7.908726449838941,1.4144356972111558,1024,35,207,14,20,321,141,251,0.172,0.7709999999999999,0.057,-0.9798,0,0,1,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,5,2,11,18,2,5,16,0,21,10,6,3,2,45,35,21,0,0,13,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,10,19,1,0,6,2,0,6,9,13,0,1,7,5,30,5,22,28,6,35,0,3,0,0,7,9,1,9,23,139,40,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09725140337194313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392794282350688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2708462467940865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436031159851731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11270251604699735,0.0,0.09450555546091603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2122618572461601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11229295839299916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246250069311395,0.0,0.0924355093051135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22189093584124464,0.15675386575113284,0.0,0.0,0.10027306368267434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463802095743267,0.0,0.12470158088475446,0.09201964493454244,0.0,0.12095579650347245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259423625226905,0.0,0.0,0.26001404493598385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11744695437649125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17885678402808042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16079647139551312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12273756343873833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07323235815898868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107759480937988,0.0,0.17513914491739271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1692304185648528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1249057007283128,0.0,0.0,0.07434241779553788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2196779418478925,0.0,0.0,0.0998759743869246,0.0,0.2478824195906563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844602116491506,0.1085061156584161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256725737547305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07288652995163955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06397285423846599,0.0,0.20798473463931452,0.10483272282433456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.120830199341754,0.09052234018975287,0.0,0.0,0.0880028420286508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057566423201256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3598523865414894,0.0,0.14129944279591108
healthanxiety,Silveresquemania,2019/04/17,"Can’t stop worrying about severe illness, cancer, surgery, and anesthesia failure - think I’m going to jinx it happening by stopping worrying about it. This is pretty superstitious, but basically it’s the fear of the fact that often things happen when you least expect them, so I’m afraid to stop expecting them to happen in order to control them into not happening.  

The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them, I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle, and then if something happens, it’s going to be more of a letdown.  This already happened this year.  I got a very small Pilonidal Cyst (now on track to get a minor procedure to remove it), and at first I was devastated - mostly because for a while I had forgotten about the possibility of these things happening, so there was more of a shock value.  I’m afraid of the shock factor of enjoying my life and being hit with cancer versus expecting it all along and hopefully mitigating a bit of it.",7.8182584269662865,7.939266893258432,8.25649438202247,67.57137078651685,62.65168539325842,11.389662921348314,36.33932584269663,11.00357731598739,4.256440898876406,769,33,126,19,10,255,106,178,0.239,0.6729999999999999,0.08800000000000001,-0.9802,0,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,4,2,10,8,0,3,11,0,8,5,0,1,2,28,26,14,0,6,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,17,9,0,5,1,0,0,3,2,5,0,1,4,0,12,3,27,19,6,19,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,5,10,99,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12417688181718214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06859571259370899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285087316126925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12620914684485876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12662470915234572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095715824298285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11758193676057613,0.0,0.12790392990977745,0.0,0.08999851219615966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6965538056418316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11176518645265196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07948149301461828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268578358039042,0.0,0.11448091024445688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1271240324149952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866291583017023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3763120763886498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22427478991425834,0.07210307101883268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09284696290738592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34283138059046186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246401328448726
healthanxiety,tr0w4w4y1212,2019/04/17,"What would you do here? Throwaway becuase my family knows my account...

For some time now I observed 'symptoms' that my mother is showing which make me really afraid that she might have cancer. She is 50 years old and recently started complaining about one sided back pain (she did a lot of physical labor all her live but still concerning), having to urinate more often and feeling full sooner. Ever since my own Doc informed me about the risks of ovarian cancer I can't get it out of my head.

I made her see the doctor but she just went for a normal checkup instead of asking for an ultrasound. They did take a blood sample but that is hardly enough to rule this out right?

I really want to let this go because right now it will be impossible to make her go again and I got enough else to worry about. On the other hand if I am right and stop pushing her it will be my fault it wasn't found early enough...

healthanxiety,lsimp77,2019/04/18,"Scared to exercise I’ve had health anxiety for around 5 years now and it was based around a fear of cancer after a scare I had in 2014, but in during a run in February I had a pretty bad panic attack that I mistook for a heart attack/cardiac arrest which really shit me up and I’ve been terrified of any heart related problems since. I used to love running/working out and would exercise 5/6 times a week, but since the panic attack I’ve been scared to go for a run or do any strenuous exercises in the gym such as deadlifts. If I do exercise, I spend the entire time terrified something might happen to me and it has just ruined something I used to really enjoy. Does anyone’s health anxiety stop them from enjoying or even doing any exercise?",12.334285714285713,6.9922228367346975,12.09096598639456,60.740938775510216,58.72789115646259,15.841632653061225,43.68571428571428,13.023866798666859,5.465577959183673,595,21,108,15,5,202,88,147,0.35700000000000004,0.541,0.102,-0.9934,0,0,2,0,1,0,10.0,0,0,1,0,6,15,3,6,10,0,12,12,3,2,0,19,17,10,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,4,7,0,1,0,6,1,3,0,12,0,0,6,0,10,3,21,9,0,18,0,1,0,1,2,8,1,4,7,70,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2445853359094048,0.0,0.18342909552317047,0.0,0.0,0.08382898524754852,0.0,0.0,0.21345276926551987,0.0,0.4091722028967341,0.0,0.0,0.10010207902371693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10491543263498206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07918537327571798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13490814856690464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06813552620997101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106017205065981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25487222042597285,0.0,0.2841374367189313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820425659858926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12718299315085124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28132717858342143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12196993581049075,0.0,0.11471732010813275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536075764771209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3600885904973996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1230640550914155,0.19834638721395256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18459239806554695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002323437676774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13981616129533922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070907336444387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09616750496750337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08728042089208295,0.0,0.0,0.08516551165903137,0.0,0.0,0.07720440927667599
healthanxiety,CompleteTumbleweed,2019/04/18,"i had some bloodwork this week &amp; last, and now i got my period - is it normal to feel like this, or should i do something? hi, so last week i had some blood taken for a test. and then this past tuesday i had some taken - this one was rough, i almost passed out &amp; threw up. afterwards i felt so gross and tingly and weak. well, i got my period last night. and today i’m back to feeling this tingly weak way - my friend said it’s because they took so much blood and that i’m on my period (which i always have a very heavy flow) and also ik anemic so that doesn’t help lmao.

but yeah no i feel very shaky and my feet are tingling and are going numb, my hands are tingling, and i’m just exhausted. i was at work earlier and jokingly asked my friend to check my pulse and she said it actually felt faster than a normal pulse. 

is this normal? does it make sense? i called my dr just to be safe and they took what i said out of context and went on a tangent and gave a spiel about periods and how i should visit with an OBGYN (which i’m doing at the end of the month) i just absolutely hate this feeling of tingly and weak and exhausted. is there anything i can do to make it better? or is it just a waiting game?",2.2829051383399204,3.56692419762846,3.522156126482216,92.34149505928856,75.79841897233202,6.799130434782609,20.55513833992095,7.365786028017652,0.3278270355731223,934,20,215,11,20,304,130,253,0.121,0.774,0.105,-0.8049,0,0,1,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,2,2,15,16,1,1,9,1,21,13,4,3,0,49,49,28,0,5,7,0,8,1,2,2,9,3,0,0,18,21,0,2,6,2,1,8,2,9,1,1,19,11,28,7,19,27,4,36,0,0,0,0,15,7,0,7,21,137,46,2,0.0,0.0,0.11531021951006673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832335723577204,0.0,0.0,0.09449505323470272,0.09832123253050083,0.25605951470816923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09723822988999173,0.0,0.11046662347180697,0.0,0.0,0.09086019248822458,0.0,0.07203117844772844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104505731254128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206578193390312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10340539606846999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465750576454837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2389874190825313,0.08441580018815133,0.2269103686350913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1825851612032456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715485889085927,0.0,0.1890117806758138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11666167793757087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920228951855184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2889562908792377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05772856163276824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15774968187313482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09431672381172812,0.0,0.08686353413856987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11088814086918997,0.34732448717815845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08007042960070461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11280012680284095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33720073296766645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09096778974169754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200487922493976,0.0,0.26256728397936097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949939989142964,0.0,0.09379243311403967,0.18956675277085072,0.0,0.106242890636704,0.10953845270620184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08602420315768967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,bagull1,2019/04/18,"Rash? Eczema? Scabies? ? I’m and 18F student and ever since coming to college I’ve had very bad health anxiety, where as soon as any small thing is wrong I’m online 8-10 hours a day trying to diagnose.
My most recent issue is a rash I’ve had on my forearms, wrists, and back of my hands for the past few days. It’s very itchy, mostly at night, and when I scratch I get hive-like spots that sometimes stay, and sometimes go away. I also have little white bumps that are very tiny and don’t show up well in pictures. I’ve been applying hydrocortisone 1% since Saturday night and it’s still happening so today I bought Benadryl cream and made an appt at my universities health services for tomorrow morning. 
After looking online I’ve narrowed it down to hives, eczema, scabies, or maybe ringworm. I think scabies scares me the most. I woke up this morning to myself scratching my wrists like crazy after doing so good not scratching, and then I started hyperventilating because I was so scared because I have read scabies is worst at night. Also, I’ve been feeling itchy around my ears, scalp, and legs but nothing is as itchy or hive like as my wrists.
Overall I don’t really know what else to do as everytime I look at it I freak out and I can’t talk to anyone about it because they laugh when I say it might be scabies or something serious. I feel so stupid.

healthanxiety,ItsIncremento,2019/04/18,"how to tell a pimple from early signs of MSRA or flesh eating disease? i'm really hoping this is just from over sweating, i had part of my arm resting on my desk, i was sweating after listen to music rather energetically, i raise my arm and suddenly notice a reddish raised bump that looked like a pimple, only thing was it came on suddenly, i didn't have this before, its not painful, mainly slightly sore/uncomfortable, gets sorer when touched. at first i thought it was just a bite or a pimple, i googled ""Sudden Pimple on arm"" and got a result for ""Woman mistakes flesh eating disease for pimple, dies."" and had a near fucking panic attack. Recently someone in the household had to drive some family to the E.R, i'm worried they might have tracked some sort of MRSA back with them, as they had to stay for a few hours. I'm really hoping this is just a sweat pimple, because the desk could have been impairing the skins ability to breath. I used to get similar bumps on my legs when working out with some particularly uncomfortable briefs, so i'm really hoping thats all it is but i can't shake the fear that it could be something more severe.",8.030863636363637,7.01430726818182,8.14,72.32500000000003,62.68181818181818,10.545454545454547,33.63636363636364,9.573946990214177,3.0313636363636367,909,30,164,14,11,297,131,220,0.064,0.8490000000000001,0.087,0.4098,0,0,1,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,3,2,9,11,2,3,14,0,20,15,11,3,1,32,36,11,1,7,8,0,2,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,12,7,2,0,1,0,0,4,3,7,0,1,12,5,15,4,28,20,9,25,0,0,2,1,6,9,1,10,12,115,27,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16493295216486076,0.0,0.111478827169402,0.0,0.08837700067632312,0.0,0.12336526137932692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16581575445912775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23150563686635897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15046386208684526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2966965615263959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13667198069137276,0.16314010866361922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12331787438155653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13402945710906966,0.15148962685411102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595183244670502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43198641366492396,0.1427737346669306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0708287333403083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12174467231777875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15379832532876536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16505796102594486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11026199942485948,0.1542663904368823,0.17009997902894586,0.0,0.15699661523377909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786290930262635,0.0,0.14314789195827132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16378342426822926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228390518859905,0.1116108411492906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15452683407656306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12671681448169506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631667690045702,0.0,0.0,0.11509602200276098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252140999223169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10554542108684677,0.14723179242880144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,h2ojaw,2019/04/18,"Possible explanation for brain fog, headaches, fatigue, dizziness with normal lab/imaging findings Hi all,

I really hope this doesn't stir up more anxiety for anyone, but I have a possible explanation for some of the symptoms that often pop up here, especially for the folks that think they have a brain tumor. 

When the bones of the neck are not in proper alignment (a lordotic curve), whether from past trauma (e.g. whiplash, repetitive micro trauma), or poor posture, it can cause a bunch of symptoms that a lot of people are attributing to brain tumors (headaches, dizziness, vision issues, brain fog, fatigue etc.). A formal x-ray/CT/MRI report will not usually comment on an absent lordotic curve if there is nothing pathologically wrong (bone spurs, herniations etc.) with the vertebrae or disc space, but a non-lordotic curve does cause real symptoms. I came across this information through physio/chiro, so if you're someone that slouches and has migraines and headaches, try keeping your chin tucked in, don't stay in awkward positions, take breaks from computer work, drink water, get a comfortable pillow, and keep your shoulders rolled back. 

I know not everyone's issues are related to this but it may be worth a try if your medical tests all came back negative but you're still experiencing symptoms.",10.829674175382145,10.207084163716818,9.391753821399842,64.32207160096543,56.9203539823009,12.642960579243764,42.66934835076428,11.741389052700956,5.240642477876107,1055,50,161,25,11,325,149,226,0.106,0.823,0.071,-0.8361,0,0,1,0,0,0,46.0,0,3,1,1,8,8,0,1,15,0,13,19,8,3,2,38,22,15,0,5,13,0,0,0,0,2,9,0,1,0,9,7,2,2,4,1,2,2,6,6,0,0,2,1,8,2,22,17,8,19,0,2,0,0,7,8,0,10,7,100,17,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169061113733983,0.0,0.0,0.07466690075926638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16422290785111707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4768317125379791,0.0,0.2442683158428394,0.0,0.2193962368875412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09344870599994276,0.0,0.0,0.10460913111360276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23818810805418286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10203811634845224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976000075454821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055791013556005464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10606209090034434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22291262538469075,0.0,0.18983170831853444,0.0,0.0,0.0586865151883553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907852088824984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10757515147559957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10462711206870083,0.10246356215600803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10193883769252424,0.0740316164560638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24076920084868506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12154527125376095,0.0684095222840838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09047900310135557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113819129055412,0.08527903398343062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.443964065588627,0.08028940237260515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06842383317486031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450006825931155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1176091358372942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774111192842738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675317495319727,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,magic-ass,2019/04/18,"Neck lump/pain Looking for some reassurance or advice if anyone else has experienced this. Two days ago I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck under my jaw. It’s painful when I turn my head to the left and when I swallow. I’m thinking it’s a swollen lymph node but I don’t have any other symptoms of an infection (cold, flu, etc) besides very mild left ear pain (like maybe the beginning of an ear infection?). I’m sure it’s nothing but it is causing some serious anxiety, it’s all I can think about. My thoughts are immediately jumping to lymphatic cancer or a malignant tumor. I’m planning to make a doctors appointment if I’m still feeling weird tomorrow.

healthanxiety,pgoodye1,2019/04/19,"Overcoming personal anxiety by helping others Long time HA sufferer and poster. I am fortunate enough to say I have managed my HA enough to a point where it’s not consistently affecting my life. Just want to share a few pearls. 

Our health anxiety is very self centered. We obsess over health , our bodies, etc. the key to recovery is to stop focusing on ourselves. More on this later. 

Everybody on here is a bit different. I personally feel a sense of relief with medical testing , doctor visits etc; but some are fearful of those things. For that reason this post may not apply to you. 

A lot of us are in the medical field. I myself am a dentist and have had the irony of dealing with hypochondriacs in my office who are worried about oral cancer. 

Examining a fearful patient the other day , and reassuring him that he does not have oral cancer, gave me an epiphany of sorts, which led me to the following. 

Today I joined the national bone marrow donation match website. It’s a wonderful opportunity to help out people that are going through what we all in this sub fear the most- terminal cancer. 

Think about it, you can save a life!Minimal procedure. A needle in your hip. Some painkillers and you are on your way. 

Not only that but there’s such a barrage of testing beforehand that you can all but be guaranteed that you don’t have any sort of underlying illness. (They only take 18-44 year old healthy donors for the most part ) all of the testing is free and meals and rides are covered. 

I don’t know if I’ll ever get called but the whole thing puts my personal health anxieties in perspective.  To save a child’s life from leukemia, for example, would forever change your life. 

I’m not saying you need to do this. But take the focus away from yourself. Whether it’s through charity, or through work, school, gym; I promise you will stop obsessing over your headache, leg twitch, or your heart flutter. I still have bad days but overall I can say I’ve improved a great deal from this philosophy.",4.814536541889485,6.807390756684498,5.142053475935828,80.40111942959004,70.57754010695187,8.943885918003565,30.64848484848485,9.473421319101043,2.946351800356506,1589,68,290,37,30,503,220,374,0.14,0.715,0.145,0.2583,1,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,5,12,1,2,9,18,0,5,25,2,28,21,5,3,4,54,41,16,0,4,16,0,1,0,0,3,15,3,0,5,23,11,1,2,6,1,2,6,7,7,0,0,2,4,35,12,46,35,17,38,0,1,0,0,38,18,0,12,12,201,58,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06404452981796495,0.0,0.2161386151919724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08848369080284453,0.0,0.07863501580384248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028184020296802,0.10461095229353676,0.0,0.0,0.09616665861265823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09962824139387384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12147453144482545,0.1941875546145918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09839636517841263,0.0,0.09639556547498564,0.0824161374446991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946228898008312,0.21006758350509847,0.0,0.08518973905625048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3179305913949769,0.0476194200871727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04920431794329642,0.0,0.05352374528659665,0.0,0.0,0.1038319995152646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3003216508081964,0.0,0.11160183706855252,0.12625156959069322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051757976209075324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26608390782761315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08334490515661731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08006709320523163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18974962520407224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0698320775158184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09882437023879506,0.0,0.0,0.14325380791885214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10198601095537134,0.0,0.06529143246884488,0.2466987936926737,0.0,0.0,0.08902901288896463,0.0,0.09019685741232268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09467528695729499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09683106290531464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22468329013680585,0.0,0.09531355133691134,0.0,0.0,0.09824859280188908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0752109781587975,0.1574746900982961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14162084644162815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12513586552076802,0.06034570494144568,0.0,0.0,0.05491617237283705,0.0,0.08927009490459505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11328499862928215,0.0,0.0,0.07770702896767086,0.05554885025286079,0.07475441662329696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10514680109161267,0.0,0.0,0.10213243876513517,0.06856298433710717,0.09564271926030657,0.0,0.06690162103090347,0.0,0.0,0.06064779076326037
healthanxiety,sirjaspycat,2019/04/19,"Anxious about Rabies even though there's no reason to (I think) Hey all. I've been having a hell of a week and, to be honest, looking back, it's really dumb but I can't help but be anxious anyway.

So back on Thursday last week, I was feeding this stray cat. Didn't know it was a stray at first since it's a pretty packed neighborhood with a lot of pet cats, so I didn't expect a stray. After a few days of feeding it, it ended up scratching me because I pet it way too much. Didn't really worry about it too much, washed the cut off and went on with my day.

Then I googled what would happen from a stray cat scratch. *Obviously* this was a mistake, but I did it anyway. First result was Rabies. Cue my panic mode, realizing I could have gotten it from the cat. I started to worry constantly for the next 2 days, and on Saturday, I went to the ER. Doctors didn't think anything would have happened, but they decided to give me the rabies shots anyway just in case. This settled my anxiety for a bit, but I started to worry again, googling if the shots ever failed. They have, but only in countries like India and China, never in the US.

Over the past week, I've been trying to fight with myself that I don't have Rabies. Last time I saw the cat was on Monday, but since it's a stray, I wouldn't expect it to stay around my house since I stopped feeding it. Now, over the past few days, I've started to feel pain in my throat at random times, not triggered by anything. I keep feeling headaches and getting itchiness on my arm (not isolated to it though), and I keep thinking food and drinks aren't going down my throat easily. Logically speaking, it's nothing, but I keep being convinced it's the rabies starting to cause symptoms

Now, I have multiple reasons not to believe I'm gonna have anything wrong, but I can't convince myself that. The likelihood of the cat having rabies with no symptoms is low, me getting rabies from a cat scratch is even lower, and me getting it after getting shots is virtually none, but my mind just won't accept that. I keep thinking of what ifs.
What if the cat had rabies?
What if the scratch gave me rabies?
What if I got the vaccine too late? It was 2 days later, that could have been too late.
What if the vaccine doesn't work and I still get it?
What if my symptoms are from rabies?
What if the cat isn't around because it died from Rabies?

I honestly need some sense knocked into me, I can't stop worrying about it. Sorry for the long post.",3.619549006838163,4.870967138554216,4.515815695213288,86.65919081732332,72.39357429718875,6.8295669163139054,26.31086508194942,7.113659591113569,1.1742368826657978,1937,64,391,18,37,627,209,498,0.134,0.792,0.07400000000000001,-0.9813,1,0,1,0,1,0,68.0,1,0,2,4,28,16,4,1,31,0,44,14,3,5,4,78,78,32,1,17,23,0,6,1,0,5,6,1,2,0,35,16,5,6,13,1,0,3,20,10,1,2,21,9,45,6,54,47,9,69,1,2,2,0,9,20,2,11,44,276,80,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057105327997028624,0.16866143026034947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842862250593432,0.1329046557855577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11479903120931938,0.0,0.09100915677386996,0.0,0.0,0.08410245705116673,0.0,0.0,0.08149601449264739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668380670890898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08066770368962765,0.0,0.11920031591007395,0.0,0.0,0.24070813151368906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07747258397926295,0.0,0.0,0.07640513999340945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312638087237829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06611575400366332,0.0,0.0,0.09860827586986204,0.06752316775696375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07548829534299584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269906839644335,0.0902643612440286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19500185419387167,0.0716089282495088,0.042424039232958455,0.0,0.05970262860587675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13202152584035035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050034816443230316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08613348648129443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2654014168051965,0.0,0.0,0.04102445375514869,0.12169576630629098,0.16841183737357393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036469122324433535,0.0,0.0,0.06606091384858623,0.06268531339919378,0.0,0.0,0.06346285158520666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753729525264429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1097493775155474,0.055350364224081225,0.057572950283928816,0.0,0.07938873394402829,0.0,0.0,0.07162653385987765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056772981177589374,0.07943047401907691,0.08758305633936674,0.0,0.0,0.14251945678997707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149191442154493,0.07594360284412757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956425262037734,0.15350064871834926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18524818213663885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08356204984313483,0.2113442598403996,0.07956457427057374,0.05961379330001839,0.12481773080631305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2327627976277721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19132506817436973,0.14668207989738008,0.0,0.08705541209025093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050680925408624254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08979205772354322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059251913084225935,0.17963377832165536,0.0,0.0,0.1383984328722341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054344454444867615,0.3032336733925952,0.0,0.10605524632725263,0.08161560132274841,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,TheFWord_,2019/04/19,"Cervical cancer scare I am scared that I'll have cancer. I used to have abnormal paps but the last 2 which was done 3 years ago was normal. I just did one 5 weeks ago and my doctor called me today to tell me I was high grade and needed to go for a colposcopy. I'm so upset and can't stop crying or worrying. I don't know what to do to feel better. What if in those 3 years it has developed to a stage of cervical cancer or something? 

Im so mad at myself for having unprotected sex when I was younger. I love my boyfriend so much and I want to spend the rest of my life with him and have kids. And I'm probably overreacting but what if I can't have kids or live a long happy life? I'm type 1 Diabetic as well and possibly have PCOS. I live a very healthy lifestyle and it all seems like such a waste right now. I just wish this was all a bad dream. 

Have any of you have similar experience?

healthanxiety,aprilsh0wers8,2019/04/19,"Super Nervous! So I have health anxiety, but that’s mostly due to the fact that I’ve had a bunch of scary health stuff happen this year. I almost ODed three times (I’m clean now), I got compartment syndrome in my hand and almost had to have it amputated, I had not one but TWO miscarriages, and I found out that I had a small cyst on my uterus...oh and my uterus is tilted. 

So recently I’ve been getting UTIs (I’ve always gotten like 2 per year since I was about 18). I try everything to avoid them. But I went in the other day to get it checked out and the test came back negative. So they think something might be wrong structurally. I’m so nervous that I have PID or ovarian cancer. I keep checking my symptoms. I called out of work because the pain was so bad. And my anxiety is through the roof. My SO keeps getting annoyed with me because I keep googling potential reasons for this. I know it’s not all in my head. I just don’t know how to make other people take my seriously.",2.8828500000000012,4.381442185000001,4.035,88.39750000000002,74.65,7.4,26.0,8.07648339933343,1.44555,767,27,164,12,16,250,120,200,0.222,0.716,0.062,-0.9888,0,1,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,2,2,11,10,1,3,7,0,15,9,2,3,2,34,34,16,0,0,7,0,1,1,0,1,7,0,1,0,12,10,0,4,5,0,2,2,4,8,0,3,12,1,26,2,18,20,3,18,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,5,9,106,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28633174047763377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11896421084582467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21874647589009288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993669239559424,0.11937570183866315,0.17430888689623586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14599046300190652,0.16352195349719248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09220515376332004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284940726034719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15676148908504334,0.0,0.0,0.2240910081060879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143478206586094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12642972438890535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467305855304608,0.3039452375941195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3812404200624365,0.0,0.0,0.1571474151189852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06984892887481221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09543496319269434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516707666553818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09688157099311194,0.0,0.1521323568166594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991188276029974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469990941814097,0.14116766533056674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11826796911590083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11006688016907053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1636688079874372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14860271795200194,0.10749719934645703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09161072591762548,0.0,0.0,0.08336816051075413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706864680439344,0.0,0.13966293227910542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13253653608770125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408536568254227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15631750830615118,0.0,0.18413864391885396

healthanxiety,lolasnickner,2019/04/20,"Basically convinced at this point that I won’t grow old. I started having hypochondria around age 19. Ironically, it started right after I recovered from anorexia/bulimia.  I’m 22 now. I can’t believe it’s been YEARS now of health anxiety. I don’t even know what symptoms are serious or not anymore. I’m in pain everyday and I don’t know what’s physical or not. I’m sick of going to the doctor. I’m sick of being in pain &amp; asking for reassurance. I’ve almost 100% convinced that I will die in my 30’s of cancer. (And no I have never been diagnosed with cancer). It doesn’t help that I’ve had two relatives die of cancer so far and my uncle has stage 4 cancer right now. I take care of my health the worst thing I do is vape. I’m convinced it’s giving me cancer and I vividly imagine my lungs rotting away inside me.

healthanxiety,8min8,2019/04/20,"I hit my head on a wooden door, should I see a doctor? Earlier today I hit my head on a wooden door and it hurt for a bit and got me a light bruise in that area. After like a minute or two the hurting stopped and I felt fine. After like 10min however, my eyes started to feel weird like my perception has changed, I'm still able to type and stuff and I'm not dizzy nor do I have a headache. I even went ahead and played a game to see if I could focus and I was fine. I took a nap to see if it would help, I woke up an hour earlier and it still feels weird. I was just wondering, is this something I shouldn't be so anxious about or should I go to the doctor? It might just be my anxiety playing tricks on me which has happened before but I'm not sure.",2.653143015521064,2.973425567073172,3.967228381374724,93.17422394678495,73.8170731707317,7.427050997782705,24.055432372505546,7.348242739294969,0.6607268292682922,579,15,143,6,11,191,94,164,0.103,0.8009999999999999,0.096,-0.2682,1,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,1,7,13,1,0,12,0,15,5,3,0,1,30,34,15,0,7,9,0,3,3,0,5,2,0,2,0,8,8,0,1,5,4,0,3,4,5,0,1,7,8,20,8,15,17,1,18,0,2,4,0,2,6,0,6,12,93,28,3,0.1470836985722486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11251862682198348,0.16616271367632912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12515739425869934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16057730449695146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555950504869913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11743436500046052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30109279591729776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09714739572757143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1487398747375759,0.0,0.14122341643342035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835910554437726,0.0,0.11763627009979988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13006562889606538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3019006167663849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858710276167602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14484781533880348,0.0,0.31491228275800504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2155729969134432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15603256074100674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3516199943142982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132322170202745,0.0,0.0,0.10410659888507948,0.0,0.2349224633511133,0.1229685579784526,0.0,0.0,0.16837564539865008,0.0,0.0,0.13862464524027124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13941814820102874,0.0,0.1634154010248916,0.0,0.0,0.14367940140779512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13634806214499395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15950599693108622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10448403942825266,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,MattR9590,2019/04/20,"Help with your HIV, STD anxiety I recently got a full STD test done which included blood work for HIV and Syphilis, and let me tell you I haven’t felt anxiety like this in a good while. I was constantly checking my online health portal and refreshing my email to see if my results came in. The whole week was nothing but dread. Because of my depression and anxiety I have engaged in some risky and self destructive behavior in the past.  Last night night results came in clean and negative thankfully! I just wanted to share an article with you that really helped me and puts things in to perspective. I really hope this helps and makes things better for those of you in a similar situation. Be safe and get tested and you will be fine I promise! Life goes on and is too short to be spent worrying. Enjoy!

healthanxiety,357fallingspring,2019/04/20,I’ve been just kind of denying or ignoring this problem for awhile... Occasionally I get either bright red blood in the bowl or like these weird pinkish red chunks in it. Like I ate a shredded reddish pink peep and came back out the same on the other end. I’ve had a colonoscopy and I was told I have internal hemorrhoids. But I didn’t mention this. I’m an idiot I know. I have an appointment in May and I promise I’ll tell my doctor then. Unrelated but I was in a car accident recently. I go to college out of state so my parents came up to help me as I am injured. It happened again today (I highly doubt it is related to the accident as this has been happening for years). I want to finally tell them but I’m afraid they’ll think it’s related to the accident and freak out thinking I’m dying and rush me to the er. I could email my doc as this is easier to admit over email rather than spoken word. But I am also afraid the doc will freak out and try to get me to go to the er. Do I wait til the appointment or what?,1.6658482252141982,3.3536289116279083,3.751529987760101,88.3206364749082,78.48837209302326,7.503059975520195,24.339045287637703,8.371475516178862,1.4540697674418603,796,28,177,16,19,272,120,215,0.165,0.755,0.08,-0.9673,1,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,2,0,6,14,1,3,14,0,18,4,1,0,0,35,37,20,1,4,10,1,0,2,0,3,2,0,0,0,11,12,1,2,4,0,0,6,1,9,2,0,10,5,24,5,30,23,2,28,0,0,5,0,11,12,0,5,11,118,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14251946887441136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13703729382622307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4076638199700974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14229117217690726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18496032836523,0.0,0.0,0.1824118811598573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.157846698051347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19522718818176185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18622126760703586,0.0,0.20256880109246736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31519207849380704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194545941763221,0.1882952504149457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18558479729384286,0.09794298896223136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17413491312293106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978880525672081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17052888039077446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17596704440638666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31153771132635777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283875509012556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16892816451283546,0.17029326193875546,0.0,0.12099713374659085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051165602998716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11476542045065888
healthanxiety,Emgetic,2019/04/20,"Body Pulling after waking up. I woke up this morning and immediately slammed into a wall. It feels like someone put bricks in the left side of my head and my overall balance is completely off when I'm standing, sitting or laying down. The left side of my head is just super heavy and is affecting my walking. It just feels like my entire body is being pulled to the left constantly. It's been about 40 minutes and it is still occuring. I'm super scared it's MS or a Brain tumor because it's ALL I can find when I look it up.
